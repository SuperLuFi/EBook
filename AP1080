Apotheosis Bab 1183

Untuk proposal semacam ini.   

 


Luo Zheng hanya tersenyum, dan jubah Martial Artist berkata kepada Luo Zheng: "Apa yang mereka lakukan, anak-anak anjing di mulut anjing tidak bisa meludahkan gading!"

 , :" , !"


"Salahku," Luo Zheng tidak lagi berbicara.

Melihat sikap dua Seniman Bela Diri Balap Manusia ini, wajah Tuan Muda Hao menunjukkan sedikit kemarahan. Setelah memikirkannya, dia mengambil dua langkah dan mengambil kepala besar itu dan menyeringai dan berkata: "Kalian Tidak ada penyesalan! "

     :" !"


Seniman Martial jubah tiba-tiba mengangkat tangannya di depan hidungnya: "Sejujurnya, sedikit penyesalan!"

 :" , !"


Tuan Muda Hao melihat sekilas dan mendengar jubah Martial Artist melanjutkan: "Karena mulutmu terlalu bau ..."

 , :" "


Tuan Muda Demon Race akhirnya benar-benar kesal. Berdiri tegak, dia menggeram: "Kamu, ikuti dua orang ini, selama mereka pergi ke luar kota, bunuh tanpa ampun!"

 , :"   !"


"Ya, Tuan Muda!"

Semua Seniman Balap Iblis yang hadir, setelah mendengarkan perintah Tuan Muda, tinggal bersama Luo Zheng dan jubah Artis Bela Diri.

 , 


Waktu satu jam berlalu dengan cepat.

Pada saat ini, di sekitar kota Dream Battlefield, tirai cahaya biru menghilang pada saat yang sama ...

   


Banyak Seniman Bela Diri tidak sabar untuk keluar dari kota, dan langkah selanjutnya adalah pembunuhan tanpa akhir!

 , !


"Waktu habis, pergi ke luar kota?" Jubah Artis Bela Diri pada Luo Zheng berkata dengan acuh tak acuh.

Luo Zheng sedikit mengangguk, dan kemudian mereka berdua bangun pada saat yang sama dan berjalan di luar kota di sepanjang jalan Dacheng.

   


"sou so so so so so "

Luo Zheng berjalan maju, tetapi memperhatikan bahwa cahaya aliran kemerahan di langit kembali dari kota.

 , 


Seniman Bela Diri ini adalah Seniman Bela Diri yang terbunuh di luar kota.

Menurut aturan Dream Battlefield, setelah kematian di luar kota, tubuh kedagingan menghilang, dan itu akan berubah menjadi cahaya yang mengalir dan kembali ke kota. Itu akan segera dihidupkan kembali ...

     


For the younger generation of Martial Artist, this is not just a Holy Land that is competing for strength, but also a great place to experience!

   !


When Luo Zheng and the cloak Martial Artist got up and walked out of the city, there were two teams behind Demon Race Martial Artist. They were followed by the orders of Young Master Hao, and it was necessary to kill them after they left the city.

   , 


But they don't know what the first two Human Race Martial Artists are!

   !


"I don't want to play against you for the time being," the cloak Martial Artist was on the left side of Luo Zheng's, and the gate was close at hand, but he said so.

" ,"   


"It's okay, I can wait," Luo Zheng responded faintly.

"That's good," the cloak Martial Artist smiled very happy.

Other Martial Artists usually rush out of the city gate, either to their own goals, or to leave the city quickly. In short, they are extremely vigilant and will never stay in front of the city gate.

     


However, after the two men stepped out of the city gate, they still kept a slow pace and marched forward slowly!

 , !


The two men's actions were to confuse the Demon Race Martial Artists who followed them. These Demon Race Martial Artists originally thought that Luo Zheng and the cloak boy would escape at a time. They were also wary of this trick. But these two people seem to use the last ten Demon Race Martial Artists as air 

     , 


Is this emboldened? Still stupid?

"Young Master Hao's order, kill them, go out once in the city, kill once, and completely light up the dream light of them!"

"     !"


One of the headed Demon Race said that his voice fell and all the Demon Race Martial Artists rushed toward the two.

   


At this time, Luo Zheng and the cloak Martial Artist also turned at the same time, both of them showed a similar smile on their faces, that is, the wolf saw the smile of the sheep 

   , 


Luo Zheng did not use a sword.

He just used Qi of Primal Chaos to condense a wind blade and slowly rotate at his fingertips!

 , !


This is a light blue, unremarkable wind blade, for these Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist, it is like a blade of death!

   , !


"pu pu pu pu "

For the Luo Zheng, the Demon Race Martial Artist is not a sheep. It can only be grass. They can't see Luo Zheng's figure. Their life is like a mowing, and they are quickly harvested!

     , !


And the cloak Martial Artist put the pipe behind him. He also never used his own weapon. He just turned out his hands and turned out, and made countless handprints. He patted the heads of these Demon Race Martial Artists, or the chest. Then, after a burst of bones, these Demon Race Martial Artists are like watermelons, crushed by his handprints 

         


When these Demon Race Martial Artists die, the fleshly body dissipates, and then a lot of yellow spots and a red spot emerge from it!

   !


A red spot wraps the soul of Martial Artist and slowly flies back to the city to resurrection.

 , 


The yellow spots are scattered, and they are gathered toward Luo Zheng and the cloak Martial Artist. This yellow spot is the Dream points of Dream Battlefield!

   , !


The first stage of the entire Dream Battlefield is ranked by dream points!

When Dream Battlefield is in its initial state, everyone has equal dream points, which is one hundred points!

   !


After death, Dream points will dissipate half, reducing to fifty points 

Once again, the dream points are reduced to twenty-five points, so they are halved in turn, until there is nothing left!

   , !


The cloak Martial Artist killed five demon clansman. The five demon clansman were also out of town for the first time. With the body, there were a hundred dream points. Each person contributed half of the dream points. He absorbed two hundred. Fifty-five dream points.

     


And Luo Zheng killed six people, naturally absorbed three hundred points, plus his own one hundred points, it has four hundred dream points.

   , 


At the same time, Luo Zheng's thoughts also appeared in the mind, the idea is to tell Luo Zheng, his current ranking 

   , 


"The total ranking is 8.8 billion In this Great Thousand World, the ranking is 1.9 billion "Seeing this ranking, Luo Zheng's face also showed a faint smile, this ranking is too low, I did not expect this Dream Battlefield just opened, and the Martial Artist is so desperate!

" , "     !


As for the cloak Martial Artist, his face is also a helpless smile, he killed five Demon Race Martial Artist, the ranking will only be lower than Luo Zheng.

   , 


However, the two did not care too much about this ranking 

Dream Battlefield is just just open 

The amount of dream points contained in these "grass" is too small, and their goal is sheep.

 " " , 


Sheep can eat grass to get fat, then wolves eat sheep, can fatten faster 

At the same time, the powerhouses of all races in the entire universe are paying attention to the rankings on the pyramid!

   !


Although Dream Battlefield only opened less than a stick of incense time.

Most of the names are still lying at the bottom of the pyramid, and some people's names have slowly taken off, and their names are also climbing rapidly on the pyramids.

   , 


After Luo Zheng and the cloak Martial Artist killed these Demon Race Martial Artists, they stayed at the gate of the city.

 , 


Most of the Martial Artists are concentrated in the city. It is the quickest way to collect Dream points and keep killing at the gate.

   , 


However, just now the two show the means too fierce.

Inside the original city gate, there are a large number of Demon Race Martial Artists ready to go out of town, or consider whether to leave the city 

   


As a result, I saw a bloody scene at the gate of the city!

A group of self-proclaimed Demon Race Martial Artists were shocked, and they were out of the city with their strength. Isn't it the object of slaughter?

   ?


So all of them were stuck in the city and refused to come out!

Due to the blockage of the previous Demon Race Martial Artist, the Demon Race Martial Artist behind could not go out of town, and the Demon Race Martial Artist at the back didn't know what was going on before, and began to scream!

   , !


But no matter how the rear Martial Artist screams, the former Martial Artist is not willing to leave the city. In the end, a large number of Martial Artists can only choose other gates 

   , 


Seeing this scene, Luo Zheng also knows that his wishful thinking is frustrating, and people are not fools. They stand naked at the gate of the city, they will not rush to hire themselves to slaughter, although this Dream Battlefield will not Real death, life is not worth the money, but always loses dream points.

         


After the two men had no choice but to look at each other, they could only leave the city gate, but the directions in which they left were different.

   


They both know that there will be 1st war between them, but this 1st war is obviously not at this time, at least until the other party accumulates enough Dream points, this 1st war will be worth taking action!

     !


After leaving the city gate, Luo Zheng chose a route that was still moving at a slow pace, but he was thinking about how to accumulate Dream points faster.

   


Standing at the gate of the city, it is obviously unrealistic. Killing only one person is only fifty points, and the Martial Artist, who has been washed once, once again kills, and the dream points will be reduced again. The second kill is only twenty. Five o'clock, this is definitely not the way 

       , 


Thinking of this, Luo Zheng's eyes fell on a hill not far away. After a slight thought, he leaped over the hill.

   , 


"I seem to be too anxious, the sheep have not yet fattened, and the wolf has no fattening Can wait any longer! Say after fattening. "

"   ! "


Apotheosis Chapter 1184 - Comrade Mao

Memikirkan ini, Luo Zheng tidak berhenti di sini.   

 , 


Dia melintas di bawah bayang-bayang dan menjaga ketinggian dengan tanah, seperti seekor goshawk terbang menjauh.

   


Setelah Luo Zheng dan jubah Martial Artist benar-benar pergi, kelompok Martial Artists yang telah ditimbun di kota itu seperti gelombang pasang surut, berkerumun keluar dari kota besar!

   , !


Dan ketika mereka baru saja meninggalkan kota, mereka berserakan dan mencoba untuk menjauh dari yang lain.

   


Aturan Dream Battlefield seperti ini!

Setelah Anda meninggalkan Kota Utama utama, bahaya ada di mana-mana.

Anda mungkin seorang pemburu atau mangsa bagi Artis Bela Diri lainnya.

Artis Bela Diri Demon Race yang biasa-biasa saja, yang bergegas keluar dari gerbang pada saat yang sama dengan Artis Bela Diri lainnya, dan pada saat meninggalkan gerbang, Artis Bela Diri Demon Race menunjukkan senyum aneh.

   , 


"Purple Flame Emperor Burst!"

Api ungu tiba-tiba meledak dari bagian dalam Seniman Bela Diri Balap Iblis ini!

Hukum Api yang misterius membentuk lingkaran, seperti nyala api yang bergelombang, menyebar dengan Seniman Bela Diri Iblis Balap ini.

   


Saat ini, ada ratusan Martial Artists yang keluar dari gerbang kota!

Ketika api ungu menyapu, semua Seniman Perlombaan Iblis Balap menggunakan Body Protection True Essence atau Astral Essence untuk mencoba melawan api ungu yang menakutkan ini.

   , 


Tetapi kekuatan nyala api ungu itu menguasai, dan Tubuh Melindungi Esensi Sejati adalah seperti selembar kertas di bawah nyala api ungu ini, yang langsung dibakar, dan kemudian nyala api ungu ini seperti kehidupan, mengebor celah. Di antara mereka mulai membakar tubuh kedagingan Martial Artist!

     , !


"Ahhhh ..."

"Sakit, nyala api sialan ini ..."

Hati-hati

Semua Seniman Bela Diri dalam sekejap mata, dan mereka semua membuat api besar dan berubah menjadi orang api.

   


Beberapa orang api menggunakan Teknik Melarikan Diri untuk terbang di udara atau di depan, tetapi semakin cepat kecepatannya, semakin penuh nyala api membakar, dan udara hanya terbang di udara selama sekitar setengah, dan itu ada di udara, mengambang di udara 

     , 


Some fire people cast a piece of crystal clear ice shield, want to separate this flame from their own body, but the flame power is far more than imagination, the condensed ice shield instantly melts, still burned to ashes by this flame!

     !


All the burnt Martial Artist, with the body, took a red light and returned to the Main City.

   


The remaining dream light points were absorbed by the Demon Race Martial Artist.

"sou sou sou "

The Demon Race Martial Artist stood in front of the city gate with a cold smile on his face, looking at the Martial Artist in the gate, and a purple flame in his hand slowly pulsing.

   , 


Just now The flame of this Demon Race Martial Artist has spread over a range of 1.000 zhang (3330m), but the purple flame that spreads towards the gate of the city is dissipated in a moment of rushing into the city!

   !


At this stage, the main city of Battlefield's Main City is still absolutely safe, and any attack will be eliminated at the Main City gate.

   


Not just this Main City, the entire Dream Battlefield, the Main City in the 50 Great Worlds!

   !


That Demon Race Martial Artist has absorbed five or six thousand dream points in a short period of time, and his ranking is also rapidly improving!

   !


"Who are you?"Among the Main City, the first person asked coldly.

Up to now, there are still many Martial Artists who are not aware of the current situation. After all, most of the Main City is demon clansman, just now Luo Zheng and the cloak Martial Artist. After all, it is not my family. However, this Demon Race Martial Artist outside the city gate is sad.

     , 


The Demon Race Martial Artist smiled faintly: "Is it important?"

"Hey, we are both demon clansman, you have such a means, never thought about it "There is demon clansman angrily said.

"   , " 


Demon Race Martial Artist interrupted him. "I don't want to talk nonsense. I only know that there is no such thing as a race in Dream Battlefield. The losers will be eliminated, and you It will be a stepping stone for me to step into this world! "

 ,"     !"


When I heard this Demon Race Martial Artist, many demon clansman faces angry colors, but more demon clansman is in the heart!

   !


Although many Demon Race Martial Artists are well prepared to meet the opening of Dream Battlefield, it is clear that their understanding is not deep enough. This Dream Battlefield is a winning battlefield, which is to be in the trillion. Among the Martial Artists, pick out the top Martial Artist's Battlefield.

       


It is noisy and ridiculous to hold the "concept" of race here!

Demon Race Martial Artist actually walked toward the gate, and the purple flame in his hand rose, and then he reached into the gate. When his hand crossed the "boundary" moment, the purple flame was taken by Dream Battlefield. The rules were extinguished, and then he said again: "My name is Long Qin "

   , " "   :" , "


After he finished speaking, he suddenly turned around. He also knew that the Martial Artist in the city gate would not come out to die. It is a waste of time to stay here.

   , 


"Long Qin !"

"It turned out to be him "

"The ninth generation Successor of the World Lord!"

"With him in a Main City, it is also us unlucky!"

"Hey, what unlucky is not unlucky, 100,000 Great World's Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist are coming in, which Main City does not have a few metamorphic fellow? But I don't know if this Long Qin is weaker than the just two Human Race Martial Artists? I really hope they pick it up! "

"   , ? , ? !"


Waiting until this Long Qin figure disappeared into the field of vision, the Martial Artist in the city re-emerged.

 , 


Throughout the Dream Battlefield, in the initial stage, the thing that blocked the city gate was constantly happening 

   


At the same time, many of the names of Martial Artists have stood out in the pyramid!

   !


In the 100,000 Great World outside of Dream Battlefield, there are countless dream spaces, and on each dream space, the names on the pyramids are constantly rising and falling!

     !


All races, Great Influences, are also closely watching the rankings.

 

Whoosh-

A wind blade ejected from the fingertips of Luo Zheng's.

Not far from the front, there are a few horn deer, these horn deer look very docile, but in fact it is also a ten-level Ferocious Beast.

   , 


The wind blade suddenly ejected, and the chests of these horned deer were penetrated. With the unspeakable screams, these horned deer were cut off, and they were with the body of the five Tibetan and six houses. Luo Zheng's wind blade was smashed.

     


The dead horned deer gradually dissipated in Luo Zheng's vision, while the pale yellow Dream points flew toward Luo Zheng within the body.

   


"Ferocious Beast in the wild, there are also dream points, but this deer horn turned out to be a dream points?"

"   ?"


In the face of this result, Luo Zheng shook his head slightly, hunting Ferocious Beast is also a way of dream points, but this Dream Battlefield is actually a super-large Arena, which is intended to encourage Martial artists to kill each other, the strongest from the middle The winner, so Ferocious Beast gives relatively little reward.

       


"But I don't know how many Dream points can be rewarded for the more powerful Ferocious Beast."

" , "


Thinking of this, Luo Zheng's figure flashed again, swept the hillside, and rushed to the front.

   , 


On top of this road, if you encounter Ferocious Beast, Luo Zheng will take action to kill it.

   


Ferocious Beast, like the level of the deer, has only one or two Dream points, and the accumulated Dream points are minimal, but Luo Zheng doesn't care.

   , 


According to the rules of Dream Battlefield, the accumulation of the early stage is not important. After some of the more powerful Martial Artists have accumulated enough Dream points, Luo Zheng can take action directly.

   , 


If you can, Luo Zheng can even lie here on the cultivation, and even find a place to sleep!

   !


It's just that he was trapped in the Immortal Mansion for a few years, and he had a chance to leave the Immortal Mansion, but he wanted to scatter his heart in the vast world of Dream Battlefield 

   


Just as Luo Zheng slowly flew, his eyes suddenly flashed slightly, but his mouth was slightly tilted.

   


The body is suddenly stopped in midair, turning his head down and looking down: "When are you going to follow?"

 , :" , ?"


His voice came out, and there was silence in the wilderness. There seemed to be no other lifeform 

   


"After accumulating a little dream points, come back to me, I am not very interested in you," Luo Zheng said after a faint remark, he continued to fly forward casually.

"   ," , 


Tracking Luo Zheng's There are three people in total. They certainly don't have time to accumulate Dream points. Now they kill three of them, but only one hundred and fifty dream points. Luo Zheng's is really not interested.

     


As a rough laughter came, three burly figures appeared out of the air, three Demon Race Martial Artists.

   


"But we are interested in you! Haha ! "

=============================

===========================


=============================

===========================


Apotheosis Chapter 1185 - Comrade Mao

Dibandingkan dengan klan setan lainnya, tiga Demon Race Martial Artists sedikit lebih kecil.   

 , 


Baju besi pada mereka sangat istimewa. Meskipun hitam, ia memantulkan berbagai warna di bawah sinar matahari.

   


Armor ini dibuat dengan "Accumulating Light Iron". Setelah bersemangat, dapat berubah warna sesuai dengan lingkungan sekitarnya. Dengan Tanda Ilahi yang menyatu pada aura, Artis Bela Diri dapat sepenuhnya tersembunyi, dan bahkan dalam jarak dekat, mereka tidak dapat menemukannya. gerakan.

 " "     


Metode ini masih berguna untuk Artis Bela Diri Alam Laut Dewa umum, tetapi tidak untuk Luo Zheng.

   , 


Persepsi Luo Zheng hari ini jauh lebih kuat daripada Artis Bela Diri rata-rata, jadi bahkan jika ketiganya berhati-hati, ia dapat dengan mudah mendeteksi keberadaan tiga orang.

   , 


Sebelumnya, Demon Race melihat Lu Zheng di gerbang kota menunjukkan kekuatan yang luar biasa, tetapi melihat Luo Zheng sendirian meninggalkan mulut, pikiran juga memiliki ide untuk mengejar orang ini!

   !


Kekuatan mereka bertiga tidak lemah, dan ketiganya juga telah membunuh pembangkit tenaga Divine Extremity Realm, dan mereka bertiga diam-diam tertinggal.

   


Luo Zheng memiliki sedikit kemalasan di wajahnya. Meskipun dia telah sepenuhnya siap untuk beberapa tahun, dia seperti seekor kupu-kupu yang baru saja menghilang. Pikiran diam-diam berubah sedikit. Sekarang juga perlu berjuang untuk melakukan baptisan rohani untuk diri sendiri.

     


Dia menatap ketiga orang itu dengan acuh tak acuh berkata, "Jika Anda tertarik, mari kita pergi bersama ..."

 ," , "


Trio Setan Balap saling memandang dengan mencibir di wajah mereka. Ketiganya tertawa, dan sosok besar menghilang ke mata Luo Zheng.

   , 


Metode tersembunyi ini memang sangat efektif.

Karena mereka bukan sekadar konvergensi, setidaknya menyembunyikan sosok mereka secara visual!

 , !


Looking at the three people who disappeared quickly, Luo Zheng smiled slightly.

I am still idle, and he is waiting for the grass to grow fat, and will be distracted in this wildness. Since these fellows are willing to appear in front of themselves, Luo Zheng does not mind taking action.

     


The three cultivation techniques recommended by the so-called "Second Senior Brother", during these five years, Luo Zheng is also involved.

 " "   


However, in five years, Luo Zheng has not stepped out of Immortal Mansion, but no one can learn from himself. Xun is the body of Sword Spirit, which is not suitable in itself, and Mu Mingxue is too different from his own strength. Although Mu Mingxue has made great progress in the past five years, it is still not qualified to discuss with Luo Zheng.

       , 


After the three men concealed, they applied the technique of lifting and rushing straight toward Luo Zheng from several directions. From the line of sight, their figure has completely disappeared, and even the shadow does not exist.

     , 


Luo Zheng at this moment, gently closed his eyes, a sense of diffusion spread from his mind!

   !


The environment around him is under the perception of perception, and it is shaped in his mind 

 , 


In this, there are three blank spaces, and these three blanks are quickly approaching Luo Zheng.

   


"The speed is not slow, but unfortunately "

In Luo Zheng's Internal Body World, the seedling of the World Tree swayed gently, and then a Qi of Primal Chaos slid quietly along the sapling, and quickly pulled him into the body.

   , 


At the same time, there was a silent smog on Luo Zheng's hands!

 , !


"Eight Tunes Flying Smoke !"

Although Luo Zheng doesn't want to see the Second Senior Brother, the vision of the Second Senior Brother is truly unique!

 , !


The three cultivation techniques he selected were prominent in the Bookstore Pavilion, but under Luo Zheng's browsing, they found that each of the three cultivation techniques is very suitable for them 

   


If you think about it, the people of Second Senior Brother are a bit problematic. It is not surprising to have this kind of vision. After all, it is a person who has surpassed Heavenly Dao. In his eyes, Luo Zheng may be like a transparent person, but at a glance Look inside and out.

     , 


This "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke" is a very unique movement technique!

The vast majority of Escaping Techniques in the universe are processed using various Source Laws 

 , 


For example, the wind is naturally using Law of Wind, while the bandits use Law of Earth, and various types of cultivation techniques processed by various laws, although their respective focuses are different, but in the eyes of experts It is the same road.

       


However, this "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke" is different. In fact, this cultivation technique is somewhat similar to Lower Realm's lower-level cultivation technique.

 , 


Luo Zheng's smoke in his hands is made by his visualization, which does not contain the power of the law!

 , !


According to the truth, the higher the cultivation technique, the more powerful the rule, the "Supreme Divine Martial Might" in this round of universe, and the Heavenly Venerate using its own Xeon Law of Karma. Comprehensible cultivation technique!

   , " ", !


"Eight Tunes Flying Smoke" is the opposite!

On the first page of this book, a pattern is drawn.

It is a ball with eight holes, and in this pattern there is a thin line running through the eight holes 

 , 


Until now, Luo Zheng didn't understand what it was, but the first step in the cultivation of Eight Tunes Flying Smoke is the visualization!

   !


However, under this visualization, Luo Zheng is also more and more mysterious!

The orientation of the eight holes, the route through which the thin line runs, faintly reminds Luo Zheng what, this pair of patterns seems to be a resentment, and even makes Luo Zheng's heart have a strange feeling!

     !


This feeling, Luo Zheng has only been produced once in the past!

On the Divine Country Continent, Luo Zheng was the first transcends tribulation.

At the last moment of the Luo Zheng transcends tribulation, there was a black light that was enough to destroy the earth. This black light pulled a thin line and circling in the air, interweaving, slowly descending towards Luo Zheng!

     !


It seems that the thin line pulled by the black light seems to be arbitrarily moving through the air, but its trajectory seems to coincide with some extremely terrifying law!

   !


This kind of law, although Luo Zheng feels faintly, Luo Zheng can't say one thing, even the description can't be done!

   , !


The lines on the pattern recorded on "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke" are not as complicated as the thin lines pulled by the black light, but the feeling for Luo Zheng's is similar 

   


So this movement technique martial skill is not Supreme Divine Martial Might, and there is no Source Law, but Luo Zheng is still cultivation!

   !


Whoosh-

As the shallow smoke spreads down on Luo Zheng's.

Meanwhile 

A black black iron knife is a hole in the space, quietly appearing behind Luo Zheng's!

   !


In the moment when this broad knife attacked, two weapons appeared in the other two directions 

   


"DEATH!"

"Monarch Slash!"

In the face of sudden attacks, Luo Zheng's face has not changed, he swayed in the air, the visualization map is already familiar in the heart of Luo Zheng, the whole person completely relaxed, he has no killing intent, nor any The idea of counterattacking seems to be waiting for you, and it seems to be inconspicuous, and the mood is also beginning to match this movement technique.

         , 


The three men used their fierce means to naturally create a wave of volatility!

In particular, the wide-knife Martial Artist, this knife smashed over, there is a whistling sound, as if even the space must be smashed!

   , !


But at this moment, Luo Zheng is like a smoke, between the world 

 , 


The knife broke open the space and reached the back of Luo Zheng's. The speed of this knife can be described as lightning fast. The average person is very sharp and can't see the knife shadow.

   , 


But when the blade is about three inches away from Luo Zheng's body, his body is moving with the knife!

   !


It's not that Luo Zheng is moving, but this knife will "pull" Luo Zheng out!

If you don't miss it, the Martial Artist doesn't hesitate, and the broad knife in his hand is again, second!

   , !


Luo Zheng is still three inches away from him, still not in the middle!

The third one!

Still three inches!

Seeing this scene, the Demon Race Martial Artist with a wide knife is also a bit stuck.

Although the offensive in the hands has not slowed down, my heart is also shocked.

What is this movement technique 

He has never seen such a weird movement technique!

The body of this fellow seems to have no weight. As long as his own broad knife is pulled out, he will push him a certain distance, then he will push it again!

     !


As a result, he could not kill Luo Zheng at all!

He and Luo Zheng always maintain a three-inch distance, these three inches It's a scorpio, it's impossible to pass!

   !


Monarch Slash, also a sharp blade technique, was originally thought to be the most powerful seven-knife of Demon Race, which contained a limit blade intent and was enclosed in the seven knives of the emperor.

     


However, these seven Monarch Slash, in the case of Luo Zheng did not resist, but even Luo Zheng sleeves have not touched.

   


Apotheosis Chapter 1186 - Comrade Mao

When the other side of the seven kills stopped, Luo Zheng's figure also stopped, he was like a drift, floating in the air.   

   , 


When he cultivated "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke," he already knew the peculiarities of this movement technique.

 , 


In order to verify the magic of this movement technique, Mu Mingxue also tried to break the movement technique by holding a long sword! However, no matter how Mu Mingxue attacked, it did not hurt Luo Zheng points!

 , ! , !


There is no absolute prohibition in this world 

The still trees are actually shaking slightly, and the stars are rotating fast or slow. I heard that even if it is 100,000 Great World, it is slowly moving in its own direction, even some Great World and Great. There will even be collisions between World! Of course, this process is calculated in millions of years, even thousands of years!

       !   !


And this "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke" can feel any fluctuations in essence, even the most subtle fluctuations 

 , 


Only with this little fluctuation, Luo Zheng's figure can be pushed away, which is why the emperor is not a scorpion, and he has never been shackled on Luo Zheng.

   , 


Mu Mingxue's strength is still too weak!

In front of these three Demon Race Martial Artists, naturally, they are not powerful, but it is also suitable to use them to review this Eight Tunes Flying Smoke!

   !


"Huh "

When the first knife Martial Artist stopped the offensive, the second person's long spear stabbed again towards Luo Zheng!

 , !


"Cup bow snake shadow spear!"

The spear tip is like a long snake, revealing a black letter and going straight to Luo Zheng's eyebrows.

   


In the face of this spear, Luo Zheng still has not evaded 

His whole person stretched out and stood upside down, but his eyes were faintly staring at the spear tip not far away!

   !


This spear tip with black gold light is always outside the eyes of Luo Zheng, still three inches At this distance, Luo Zheng can see the shallow lines above the spear tip!

   , !


As long as three inches, long spear can pierce Luo Zheng's eyebrows 

But these three inches are always a distance that can't be expected!

"sou sou sou "

The Demon Race Martial Artist's face became more and more dignified, and the long spear in his hand was wielding like a shuttle. The sound of the broken sound continued to blast in the air, like a series of firecrackers!

   , !


No matter how flexible this long spear is, how to be fierce, after all, can not stab Luo Zheng 

   


Seeing this scene, the faces of the three men were gloomy.

Although they can't understand the strange movement technique that Luo Zheng casts, even the idiots may be able to understand that Luo Zheng did not regard them as opponents.

   


For Demon Race, being humiliated in battle is an unforgivable thing.

 , 


"The second child, the third child, blocked his retreat!"The headed Demon Race Martial Artist snorted and the black broad sword once again pulled out of his hand.

"   !" , 


In Luo Zheng's opinion, his display of "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke" is actually a kind of rule that moves with the wind, and this rule implies a kind of supreme technique, so that it can create a three-inch insurmountable distance. But in the eyes of these three Martial Artists, Luo Zheng uses his own speed, artificially keeps the distance, and plays them three!

       , !


Broken Luo Zheng's weird movement technique, but there is a way, under the triple-team, Luo Zheng is nothing.

   , 


But they are far underestimating the wonders of "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke" 

The three of them rushed over, and indeed sealed Luo Zheng's way, a knife, a spear, a sword, is the Luo Zheng firmly stuck in the center from three different directions.

     , 


No matter which direction Luo Zheng retreats, he will hit the weapon of another person.

 , 


But just under the pressure of three people, a strange scene appeared!

His whole person was twisted for a while, like a retractable squid, squeezed out of the gap between the three weapons!

   !


From the beginning to the end, he still maintains a three-inch distance 

"This "

Seeing this scene, the three Demon Race Martial Artists were also shocked.

They even suspect that Luo Zheng is not human 

Whether it's Demon Race or Human Race, there are also some techniques that can distort your fleshly body, Martial Artist Body Refinement, which is just soft and soft, and if necessary, even the burly Demon Race Martial Artist can fold your body out. Unbelievable, this is not a difficult thing.

       , 


But just now, the distance between the weapons of the three of them is only half a foot!

Luo Zheng's body is turned into a flat thing, slipping away from the width of less than half a foot, and he still keeps three inches in the process of slipping away, Luo Zheng's body is twisted to the extreme, It seems to be like the mollusks 

     


When Luo Zheng got out of their attack range, the whole person returned to normal again, and his face still had a faint smile. "Continue?"

   ," ?"


Two of them, Demon Race Martial Artist, have a horrified expression on their faces, and their hearts have been faintly retired 

   


Their three brothers had a bit of confidence to take away Luo Zheng's life, and his with the body's dream points, but in this strange battle, confidence was also wiped out bit by bit, they realized that they picked the wrong one. The object.

     


"If you don't continue, will you still come?"Luo Zheng's eyes show a hint of cool, three people in front of the kill, in any case also have one hundred and fifty dream points!

" , ?"   !


Luo Zheng's voice just fell, I heard a "squeaky" sound, but it was a bow-string ejection!

 , " " , !


Whoosh-

Not far from the remaining Demon Race Martial Artist is to open the bowstring and shoot an arrow at Luo Zheng!

 , !


"This "

Luo Zheng also realized that it was a little bad, and then he saw that the arrow that lasing out was going straight to himself!

 , !


"Eight Tunes Flying Smoke revoked

Luo Zheng hasn't had time to spread it around the whole body, the faint smog is removed, this arrow is posted on the chest of Luo Zheng's 

   


Like the previous attack, the arrow of this arrow is always three inches away from Luo Zheng!

   !


Luo Zheng The light-smooth body is equal to being pushed by this arrow and heading backwards!

   !


How fast is the arrow? What's more, this arrow was shot by a Martian designer from Divine Sea Realm.

 ? 


In an instant, this arrow pushed Luo Zheng out of the distance of 1.000 zhang (3330m) until the arrow's power gradually deteriorated, and the arrow fell down, and Luo Zheng's figure stopped.

     


What makes Luo Zheng helpless is that even when the arrow is pointing down, his body still keeps three inches from the tip of the arrow, as if he wants to make it up and let the arrow hit until the arrow falls. At the moment on the ground, Luo Zheng's body was again twisted and forced out from the gap between the arrow and the ground.

       


In the process, Luo Zheng's body still maintains a three-inch distance from the arrow and the ground 

 , 


In this case, even Luo Zheng himself did not expect that he was also stunned.

   


"What is Eight Tunes Flying Smoke, isn't this a mental disorder movement technique "Luo Zheng is also silent for a while. This movement technique is displayed. It seems to be involuntarily maintaining a three-inch distance from the other party. This inexplicable movement technique also makes Luo Zheng quite speechless, and at the same time vaguely doubts whether he is not reliable. Did the Second Senior Brother give it a pit?

" , "     , ?


When he removed the smoke from his body and slowly rose into the air, the three Demon Race Martial Artists fled in the opposite direction.

   


Whoosh-

The three men sneaked around themselves, and now they can't escape if they can't help themselves. Luo Zheng will not let them go.

   


Although he is separated from the three Demon Race Martial Artist by 1.000 zhang (3330m), it is not difficult to catch up with Luo Zheng's strength and kill three of them!

   !


These three Demon Race Martial Artists have basically fallen into desperation, and they are already planning to tie their hands. Their strength with Luo Zheng's is not a level.

   


Fortunately, here is Dream Battlefield. After they die, they still have the chance to be born again. It's just that the dream points with the body are going to lose half 

   


Unexpectedly, one of the arrows shot by one of them actually pushed Luo Zheng so far away. The three people, like Luo Zheng, were also stunned. The Demon Race Martial Artist of archery wanted to swear on the spot, he I have never seen such a weird scene in my life.

       


Since Luo Zheng is pushed away by such a long distance, there is no reason to not run.

Seeing that the fiend was chasing back in madness, the three also activated the armor at the same time and slowly disappeared into the eyes of Luo Zheng's.

   


However, this trick did not mean much to Luo Zheng. After all, the three did not escape the fate of being killed by Luo Zheng.

   


Soon after, three red spots wrapped their souls, and they flew towards Main City. They could only wait for themselves to resurrect in Main City.

   , 


Apotheosis Chapter 1187 - Comrade Mao

A red light spot constantly returns to the Main City.   

 , 


Martial Artist is constantly being killed, and her dream points are squeezed in half, and after a period of waiting, they are revived.

   


This process is a great opportunity for Martial Artist!

Not all Martial Artists have to enter the dream space cultivation 

In fact, in the Great World, only the core cultivation of the 10th Grade Holy Land was built in the Dream space.

   


Often only the core geniuses in Holy Land are eligible to enter.

But now Dream Battlefield is for 100,000 Great World, all Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist, no matter what the origin, regardless of talent, they are free to enter and free to kill.

     , 


There are some Divine Sea Realm Martial Artists who know very well that it is a delusion to win a good place in Dream Battlefield with their own strength.

 , 


The genius in the 100,000 Great World, too much 

Some of the legacy people of Little Holy Land, some descendants of the City Lord, Holy Land core genius, and even Holy Land Holy Lord Successor 

   , 


These Martial Artists are a very terrifying number, and there are many World Lord's Successor, even the descendants of Heavenly Venerate, and the Martial Artists who have the Grand Generation Tournament of Fate, the darling of the world. !

     , !


With these top geniuses in front, what is the tough thing to do in this Dream Battlefield?

   ?


After giving up the impact rankings, some Martial Artists also looked at the Dream points, and continued to kill, experience, die, resurrect, and reunite outside the city. In this time of life and death, I realized a little heart!

       , !


Above the Vast Cloud Heavenly Palace, there is also a huge pyramid.

Many Martial Artists will look at the pyramid from time to time to see the ranking of the mega-Martial Artist on the pyramid!

 , !


"Luo Zheng's name Never stood out," an old man reverent and respectful standing next to Yun Luo. "There are too many names on the lower level of the pyramid to find him! But the name of Ai Anxin has already floated up, ranking 130,000th among her Great World, and 4.6 million in the entire Dream Battlefield! "

" ," ," , !   , !"


With the sense of Yun Luo and the old man, you can easily find your own goals from millions of names 

 , 


However, after Luo Zheng left the city, he hardly accumulated dream points. The current ranking has not only failed to rise, but has declined. Now Luo Zheng ranks after tens of billions!

     !


Finding Luo Zheng in this massive name is by no means an easy task.

"Strange, what is the fellow doing?"Yun Luo's face showed a hint of doubt.

" , ?" 


With Luo Zheng's strength, not to mention Dream Battlefield, but he is not difficult to stand out in a city, the first five million should be simple for Luo Zheng.

   , 


"Let's continue to observe, Martial Artist of my Vast Cloud Heavenly Palace reports to me," Yun Luo indifferently said.

"  " 


Vast Cloud Heavenly Palace is certainly the core force in the Human Dao Alliance, and the Martial Artist is also an elite 

 , 


But the universe is so big, there are shocking talents in many unknown corners, so Yun Luo can't say that the 13 Palace's Martial Artist can win the top spot.

   , 


At this stage, Ai Anxin has already entered the 130,000th place of Great World. With her talent and strength, I believe that the top 5,000 people should be involved. The problem should be small. If we go forward, we can only see her play and strength. .

     


Dream space, fifty Great World, countless Main City are killing insanely, and the names of the top geniuses are flying at the top of the pyramid along the way of 100,000 Great World, countless lifeforms!

     , !


After six hours, night falls.

But Dream Battlefield, day and night, the battle is still going on 

Pa

The tortoise shell of a tortoise was torn apart by Luo Zheng. With a faint blue-blind stroke, the fleshly body hidden under the tortoise shell was easily killed by Luo Zheng.

   


When the corpse of the tortoise disappeared, it shot ten dream points and went straight to Luo Zheng.

 , 


Traveling through the wilderness, the cumulative Dream points are quite slow, but Luo Zheng doesn't care.

   


In fact, many powerhouses are like Luo Zheng. They are leaving the Main City for a while, waiting for the grass to grow fat. Some Martial Artists even dug a big pit and slept in the beauty.

     


Luo Zheng used this opportunity to explore in the wilderness, and he was not willing to waste time.

 , 


After killing the evil turtle, Luo Zheng looked at the rolling hillside in front of him, as if he could not see the margin 

   


This Dream Battlefield is so large, equivalent to the area of fifty Great Worlds, although there are countless Main Citys, but the distance between Main City and Main City may not be too close!

   , !


"Almost, it's time to go back," Luo Zheng looked at, smiled, and then prepared to return to Main City, now almost the time of harvest.

"  "   , 


However, when Luo Zheng just turned his head, he suddenly felt a faint energy fluctuation in the front left.

 , 


He was slightly flashed, and the figure disappeared into place, followed by the hill in front of the left.

   


In the depression below the two hills, there is a ray of light that is constantly spinning, and this rays of light is transmitted from a hole.

   


"What is this?"Luo Zheng is a little glimpse.

This Dream Battlefield doesn't seem as simple as Luo Zheng imagined. Perhaps, the method of taking dream points is not limited to other Martial Artists.

   , 


Around the revolving light, there are three mice covered in golden hair. These mice are huge in size, just like a piglet, but just here they are exuding a majestic momentum. This kind of momentum is from They are emitted from the blood!

     , !


"divine beast , Heaven Splitting Rat ?"

Luo Zheng's brow wrinkled slightly.

The real adult divine beast is still very powerful. These Heaven Splitting Rats are all eleven divine beasts, comparable to Divine Sea Realm, but because of the divine beast bloodline, it is still a bit of a hassle.

     , 


What is in this cave? There are actually three Heaven Splitting Rats to watch?

Because of this, Luo Zheng is more interested in that cave!

Heaven Splitting Rat is also a top-notch in the divine beast. On the one hand, because they are very aggressive, their talents are all concentrated on the pair of invincible teeth. On the other hand, it is the fastest. Divine beast.

     


Three Heaven Splitting Rats are a bit of a hassle for Luo Zheng, but Luo Zheng will not give up exploring the cave.

   


After all, in Dream Battlefield, there is a chance of success, and Luo Zheng is not necessarily afraid of this Heaven Splitting Rat 

   


He walked slowly down the hill.

The three Heaven Splitting Rats, which were originally tied together, were alert and raised their heads. The black eyes of the six pairs of soybeans were fixed on Luo Zheng, and the screams of zhi zhi zhi seemed to be communicating.

     


Luo Zheng's expression is calm, but the level of cautiousness in the heart is getting higher and higher, and this Heaven Splitting Rat can stand on the top of the divine beast.

   


200 feet 

Fifteen feet 

100 feet !

"sou sou sou !"

When Luo Zheng's footsteps just stepped into the 100 feet range, the three Heaven Splitting Rats suddenly disappeared into the sight of Luo Zheng's!

 , !


Three fuzzy shadows, gently swaying in his pupil, Luo Zheng felt on his body, there was a pain that was scratched by sharp objects!

   , !


Then the three Heaven Splitting Rats reappeared not far away, they were triangular with each other, encircling Luo Zheng and revealing its pair of sharp front teeth towards Luo Zheng! There is a colorful flow on the incisors. This pair of incisors is the talent of Heaven Splitting Rat, and there is a Law of Karma in it, so that their lethality is very terrifying.

   , !   , 


"pu pu pu !"

At this time, only three blood fogs were sprayed on the body of Luo Zheng's, which were the left shoulder, the right chest and the legs.

   , 


This speed is indeed so fast that it is incredible!

Luo Zheng didn't care about the wounds on his body. The speed of the three little Heaven Splitting Rats has exceeded a certain limit, and Luo Zheng will not follow the stupidity.

   , 


Luo Zheng still targeted the cave that was flashing in the light, and then he lifted his foot toward the cave!

 , !


When he just took action, the three Heaven Splitting Rats disappeared again!

Just as they disappeared, the Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword in Luo Zheng's hands suddenly pulled out, and a Sword Shadow was like a wheel, protecting himself, and dozens of Nether God Shadows from the tip of the sword, with Luo Zheng as The center of the circle spreads toward the surroundings.

     , 


=============================

===========================


=============================

===========================


Apotheosis Chapter 1188 - Comrade Mao

Ada puluhan Nether God Shadows di lapisan terluar, dan cahaya pedang di lapisan dalam melindungi seluruh tubuh.   

 , 


Luo Zheng Putaran serangan ini dapat digambarkan sebagai tidak bisa ditembus.

Meski begitu, itu masih tidak bisa menghentikan serangan tiga Tikus Pemisah Surga ini ...

Kecepatan dari tiga Tikus Pemisah Surga masih di luar perkiraan Luo Zheng!

 , !


Tiga bayangan tikus emas kecil dibor melalui Nether God Shadow yang padat pada kecepatan yang tidak dapat diobservasi, sementara cahaya pedang Luo Zheng berputar di sekelilingnya seperti roulette, di mana cahaya pedang hanya sebuah manuver berkecepatan tinggi. Di bawah ilusi bahwa sebenarnya ada kesenjangan antara kecepatan berturut-turut.

     


Ukuran dari Heaven Splitting Rat ini adalah mudah untuk melewati celah ini dan dengan cepat mendekati Luo Zheng!

   !


"Pu pu pu!"

Masih tiga bunga darah meledak!

Salah satu luka ada pada klavikula di atas dada Luo Zheng. Itu juga Luo Zheng yang bersandar sedikit di belakang milenium, kalau tidak tenggorokannya akan langsung digigit.

     


Luka yang disebabkan oleh serangan Heaven Splitting Rat ini tidak besar, tetapi sepasang gigi tikus hampir tak terkalahkan. Saat ini kerusakan umum hampir tidak dapat menyebabkan kerusakan pada tubuh kedagingan Luo Zheng, tetapi dalam menghadapi serangan gigi tikus ini, ia tidak dapat menahan sedikit pun!

     !


"zhi zhi zhi "

Dalam sekejap mata, tiga Surga Membelah Tikus muncul tidak jauh. Mereka masih menjaga jarak tertentu dari Luo Zheng dan berkomunikasi satu sama lain secara konstan, tetapi mata hitam kedelai menunjukkan sedikit sarkasme. warna.

     , 


Binatang ilahi, pada dasarnya telah membuka Kebijaksanaan Spiritual, Surga Memisahkan Tikus tidak terkecuali ...

   


Melihat adegan ini, ekspresi Luo Zheng semakin tenang.

This Heaven Splitting Rat ranks first in the divine beast and is worthy of its name. This race may be second only to Super Divine Beast.

   


It is said that Heaven Splitting Rat is far more powerful than the average divine beast. Now Luo Zheng only faces three Heaven Splitting Rats. The pressure is not particularly large, but there are hundreds of Heaven Splitting Rats I am afraid he will run away now.

   , 


In terms of speed alone, Luo Zheng is afraid that there is no way to take these Heaven Splitting Rats. He can't capture these Heaven Splitting Rats at all. How can they be killed?

   , ?


Fortunately, the Heaven Splitting Rat's habits are also very weird, Luo Zheng does not move, they do not move, but as long as Luo Zheng moves, they will launch the most accurate attack in the shortest time.

     , 


Luo Zheng, standing in the field, quietly pondered for a while, and soon after, his face showed a faint smile!

   !


As the surface of the sea of primal chaos appears a little bit turbulent, the white smoke once again appears in Luo Zheng's body 

 , 


"Eight Tunes Flying Smoke !"

Although this movement technique is somewhat inexplicable, in many cases it has an unexpected effect!

 , !


When Luo Zheng runs the movement technique, his whole person seems to be like a catkin, a blue smoke fluttering 

   


At the moment when Luo Zheng just applied this movement technique, the three Heaven Splitting Rats jumped again!

 , !


"sou sou sou !"

Just smell it, not see it!

Luo Zheng can't lock the three Heaven Splitting Rats, but he can be affected by any fluctuations while running Eight Tunes Flying Smoke. The so-called "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke" moves with it. Not just the wind Even a small energy fluctuation can push Luo Zheng away!

   , !


The first mouse shadow hits Luo Zheng's moment, pushing Luo Zheng backwards!

 , !


The second mouse shadow came back from the other direction, and Luo Zheng's body turned in the direction, still fluttering in the air 

   


The third 

Regardless of how these three mouse shadows are blown, Luo Zheng can always maintain a three-inch distance from them! Luo Zheng's eyes, faintly watching the eyes of the eyes with a colorful face, but the face is indifferent.

 , !   


The speed of this Heaven Splitting Rat is amazing, and the speed at which Luo Zheng is constantly retreating is equally amazing.

   


If anyone sees this scene, it is absolutely shocking and stunned!

Because they can only see the four intertwined shadows, and can't even distinguish the four flashing shadows!

 , !


"sou sou sou sou "

Under this dodge, Luo Zheng also took out the Qi of Primal Chaos with the body!

 , !


The Qi of Primal Chaos, Luo Zheng is half used to supplement the consumption of "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke", while the other half is quietly immersed in the ground.

 , " " , 


The Qi of Primal Chaos, which had not entered the ground, were quietly connected together to form a faint ring.

   


This ring encloses the range of thousand feet (333 m), and above the ring, it begins to condense a little bit of mysterious law. What is hidden in this law is not simply Law. Of Thunder, which has a line of Dao Accumulation, which is like a tiny True Dragon entangled 

     , 


This is the second cultivation technique of cultivation by Luo Zheng in the past few years, Thunder Tribulation Kill!

Second Senior Brother recommended the second cultivation technique for Luo Zheng, and it is also a powerful cultivation technique.

 , 


Compared to "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke", this "Thunder Tribulation Kill" looks "normal", but the so-called "normal" is only relative to Luo Zheng!

 , " " , " " !


He doesn't know what level of cultivation the Thunder Tribulation Kill belongs to, whether it's a Supreme Divine Martial Might, but since Luo Zheng cultivation he has found this Thunder Tribulation Kill to be extremely costly for Qi of Primal Chaos.

   


In the case of the Martial Artist of the Divine Sea Realm cultivation base, even if you run out of Divine Sea, I am afraid that this "Thunder Tribulation Kill" will not be displayed, because the cultivation technique True Essence consumes too much!

   , !


Even with Luo Zheng, the Thunder Tribulation Kill was laid out and consumed a considerable amount of Qi of Primal Chaos!

   !


At the time of Immortal Mansion cultivation, Luo Zheng has seen the power of Thunder Tribulation Kill several times, but now Luo Zheng is using it for the first time in actual combat 

   


Three Heaven Splitting Rats are still rushing to kill Luo Zheng!

Speed is their greatest advantage and dependence. At this moment, they also bring their own speed to the extreme, and stimulate their bloodline to the maximum, and the hair shines with pure golden brilliance!

     !


What makes them unreasonable is that no matter how much they increase the speed, the human beings always maintain the same speed!

   !


They are fast, Luo Zheng is fast, they are slow, and Luo Zheng is slow, this human seems to never touch, as if an illusion!

     , !


Just as Luo Zheng activated the Thunder Tribulation Kill, a sigh of relief came from the depths of their bloodline, a strong sense of crisis.

   


At this moment, the three Heaven Splitting Rats seemed to be negotiating, flying in three directions!

   !


Luo Zheng, who lost the "thrust", calmed down again, fluttering up and down in the air, watching the three-sounding rat shadow, but his mouth was a smile.

 " "     


"Can't escape "

After the formation of the ring below, the thousand feet (333 m) circle has become a land of looting.

 , 


In all of them, lifeform will be subjected to Thunder Tribulation baptism, except for Luo Zheng!

No matter how the three Heaven Splitting Rats escaped, they couldn't get out of the land of looting. The eyes of the big beans were full of fear, and the voice of "zhi zhi" became sharp and urgent!

   , " " !


A huge world of pressure, very abruptly appearing in the sky, the mysterious Dao Accumulation rule in the air is a perfectly analogous arrangement, and only when transcends tribulation occurs, Luo Zheng is hard to produce this Thunder Tribulation is coming.

     


"Boom!"

In the sky, a thick, dragon-like lightning circled around, and then headed down toward the bottom!

   !


This Thunder Tribulation, which was introduced by Luo Zheng, began to baptize the 100 feet range.

 , 


Even at this moment, the three Heaven Splitting Rats did not choose to give up, they took their own speed to the limit, and even drilled in the gap of lightning fork 

   , 


However, the Thunder Tribulation Kill is too powerful, it almost completely covers this thousand feet (333 m) range, in a state of saturation attack, with more and more lightning, bigger and bigger, there are no holes and gaps at all. These three Heaven Splitting Rats are inevitable!

       !


After dozens of breathing hours, the sky gradually returned to normal.

The three Heaven Splitting Rats fell to the ground and were all over the place. Soon after, their corpse gradually dissipated. At the same time, each Heaven Splitting Rat produced thousands of dream points and flew towards Luo Zheng. go with.

       


"Is there three thousand dream points?"Luo Zheng's smile on his face.

His goal was originally the cave, but I didn't expect this Heaven Splitting Rat's reward to be good, but three thousand dream points are nothing compared to other Martial Artists!

   , !


Killing 60 Martial Artists will give you three thousand dream points. In this Dream Battlefield, some radical Martial Artists may have killed thousands of opponents 

   , 


Apotheosis Bab 1189

Luo Zheng bahkan terlalu malas untuk memeriksa peringkatnya.   

 


Bukannya dia tidak ingin bersaing untuk mendapatkan tempat yang bagus di Dream Battlefield ini. Bahkan, dia memilih untuk melangkah ke dalamnya dan dia tidak akan menyerah untuk naik ke puncak!

   !


Hanya saja Dream Battlefield baru saja dimulai, dan tidak terburu-buru untuk Luo Zheng.

Setelah menyerap poin-poin mimpi itu, mata Luo Zheng jatuh ke dalam gua. Gua itu sebenarnya dijaga oleh tiga Tikus Pemisah Surga, tetapi saya tidak tahu apa yang disembunyikan?

   , ?


Saat Luo Zheng berjalan menuju lubang, cahaya itu perlahan bergerak dan terhalang di depan Luo Zheng.

   


Pada saat yang sama, ada kalimat di benak Luo Zheng.

Ke dalam terowongan angin jahat, Anda perlu membayar 300.000 poin mimpi!

300.000 poin mimpi, wajah Luo Zheng tiba-tiba menunjukkan senyum.

Dia telah mengumpulkan poin mimpi sekarang, totalnya kurang dari empat ribu poin, yang agak terlalu besar.

   


Butuh begitu banyak teknik kultivasi dan tidak bisa masuk ke dalamnya. Luo Zheng sedikit tertekan, tetapi tempat ini dicatat Luo Zheng, tidak hanya memiliki tiga penjaga binatang ilahi, tetapi juga perlu membayar 300.000 poin mimpi untuk masuk. Gua, ada apa pada akhirnya?

     , ?


Setelah memikirkannya, Luo Zheng tidak tinggal di sini. Sosoknya diputar mundur dan terbang di udara, dan dia kembali dengan kecepatan yang sangat cepat!

     !


"Hu ~"

Setelah masa dupa, Kota Utama muncul kembali di hadapan Luo Zheng.

 , 


Pada saat ini, Artis Bela Diri Iblis Balap yang mengenakan baju besi perak terbungkus darah dan sepasang kapak darah besar melambai liar!

   !


Artis Bela Diri Balap Iblis ini adalah "Tuan Muda Hao" yang pernah ditemui Luo Zheng di kota sebelumnya!

 , " " !


The Young Master Hao was born very well, although he is not considered to be the core discip of the 10th Grade Holy Land, but it is from the Demon Race's Giants comparable to the 10th Grade Holy Land. This Giants is also famous in Demon Race!

   , !


With the opening of Dream Battlefield, he has achieved the treasure in the family!

Not only put on the holy konjac, but also took the pair from the 1st Grade Divine Tool, the blood-blood axe!

   !


In the previous few hours, Young Master Hao organized the Demon Race Martial Artist, which wiped out the Martial Artists of other races. He killed 600 Human Race Martial Artists and three or four hundred other races. The Martial Artist has a combined number of thousands!

       !


In the first round, he earned more than 50,000 dream points, and the ranking on Dream Battlefield rushed to the forefront!

 , !


After the resurrection of these Martial artists, he slaughtered the second round. The second death of the Martial Artist, with the body's Dream points will be reduced by about half, this time he only got more than 20,000 points, these two Under the second accumulation, he has won more than 70 points!

       !


Under greed, Young Master Hao originally wanted to kill the third round, but this method was not good.

   


At first, the Martial Artists of Dream Battlefield learned about the rules, but they didn't experience it for a long time.

   


However, everyone is not a fool. After being killed one or two times, everyone understands it. Why do you want to be at the mercy?

   , ?


Death also loses Dream points, so that you will kill you for no reason? Moreover, if I have been staying in the city, I am in an absolutely safe state. How can you take a Young Master Hao to take me?

 , ?   ?


Those who have this idea are not only the Martial Artists who have been killed, but also the Demon Race compatriots who helped this Young Master Hao!

   !


Everyone enters Dream Battlefield, either to compete for the rankings, or for their own experience. Your Young Master Hao may be very appealing outside, but there is no way to call people here. Although everyone is a Demon Race compatriot, but stand In this Dream Battlefield, there is an enemy between each other 

       , 


This Young Master Hao can only be alone, looking for his own goals, and perhaps more dream points.

   


He was born in the door, the high hopes of many elders in the family, and naturally hope to win a good result!

   !


However, Young Master Hao was just out of town and was stared at by several Demon Race Martial Artists.

 , 


At the beginning, Young Master Hao used everyone to understand the rules and earned so many dream points. Naturally someone was jealous. Killing this Young Master Hao once would give you three or four thousand dream points, which is one step in place!

     , !


But the strength of Young Master Hao itself is not bad, his talent is enough to be included in some of the core hierarchy of Holy Land!

 , !


Moreover, he is full of treasures, this way to fight, not only has not been killed, he himself killed five or six Martial Artist, but earned a lot of points.

     


"Roar Look at your waste, how much I have! "This Young Master Hao also activated his strength of Bloodline, Bronze Blood!

" , !" , !


This bronze blood is similar to the violent blood of Demon Race, which allows Martial Artist to forget the pain in a short time, double the power, and the whole person becomes more energetic and brave! However, the blood of bronze is more than the blood of the violent, and the damage to itself is even smaller.

   , ! , 


The three Demon Race Martial Artists who besieged him, since they dare to find Young Master Hao, are not good at themselves.

 , 


At first, the three of them could still suppress this Young Master Hao, but with the activation of the bronze blood of Young Master Hao, it was the more brave and the more brave, this is the retreat!

   , !


"Pu~"

One accidentally, the blood hatchet hit one of the Demon Race Martial Artists. The heavy axe smashed down, and it split the Demon Race Martial Artist into two pieces from beginning to end!

     !


After the Demon Race Martial Artist fell, it turned into a red spot and returned to the Main City to resurrect. As for the Dream points, it was naturally absorbed by the Young Master Hao!

   !


After being killed by Young Master Hao, the remaining two were even more unsatisfied. One of them even turned and ran, trying to escape to the Main City!

   , !


But how can Young Master Hao, who is activated by the blood of bronze, let the two men run?

 ?


I saw him roaring, and a mysterious imprint appeared on the blood hatchet of his hands, and then he threw the blood hatchet straight ahead!

   !


"hu hu hu "

The two Demon Race Martial Artists heard the sound of heavy objects flying in the back. Before they even turned around, they saw that the blood hatchet was two, four, and four, and suddenly there were countless blood hatchets in the air!

     !


"Crush you!"

As Young Master Hao snarled, those blood hatchets smothered at the same time toward the two demon clansman.

 , 


In the twinkling of an eye, as if there were countless people holding down the blood hatchet, the two Demon Race Martial Artists were directly fragmented by these blood hatchets 

   


"hu hu hu "

Those blood hatchets were continually merged together and eventually turned into two blood hatchets back in the hands of Young Master Hao.

 , 


The blood hatchet in the hands of Young Master Hao can indeed be regarded as the 1st Grade Divine Tool, and many of the Martial Artists watching the battle on the wall are also silent.

   


"The blood hatchet I thought it was a phantom that was transformed! "

"Hey, this Young Master Hao is actually in general, relying on the bronze blood of his family and the two Divine Tools!"

"   !"


"There are two Divine Tool in hand, the offensive is unbeatable, and I am impervious to sword or spear!"

"   !"


Because of the strength of Young Master Hao, it is once again let the Martial Artists in the city dare to go out of town 

 , 


The Young Master Hao held two blood hatchets and slammed the blunt face of the axe against the armor of his chest. Under the stimulation of the blood of the bronze, he snarled toward the many Martial Artists in the Main City: "The fools! Come out and let Laozi kill! What is the use of you in addition to contributing your own dream points? "

   , :" ! ! , ?"


I have to say that this Young Master Hao is also a smarter class in Demon Race. When you step into Dream Battlefield, you can sing the same clan Martial Artist to help you accumulate your dream points.

   , 


Now that Young Master Hao has accumulated enough Dream points, he is so provocative. His provocative goal is naturally not limited to the foreign Martial Artist. In fact, the Martial Artist he is facing now is basically demon clansman!

   , !


"Uighur! You are on! "

"Mom, I have already tied up so many Human Race Martial Artists to him, but now it is a bite!"

"   !"


"Hey, here is Dream Battlefield. There is no race between them. We were stupid at first!"

"   , !"


"peng peng peng peng peng !"

Young Master Hao's two blood hatchets continually licking their breastplates, the sound of the sound, the double-eyed pupils are red, but in this bright red, there is a hint of blue, that is the effect of bronze blood.

     


On the occasion of the provocation of Young Master Hao, Luo Zheng's figure appeared quietly behind him.

 , 


Apotheosis Chapter 1190 - Comrade Mao

Luo Zheng tidak berkumpul di auranya sendiri.   

 


Hanya saja Tuan Muda Hao ini dalam keadaan bersemangat, tetapi mengabaikannya nanti.

 , 


Ketika Luo Zheng hanya tiga langkah dari Tuan Muda Hao, Tuan Muda Hao tiba-tiba berbalik. Di bawah kendali darah perunggu, naluri tubuh telah menggantikan pemikirannya!

   , !


Dia bahkan tidak melihat Luo Zheng. Di bawah kondisi terkondisi, Tuan Muda Hao secara tidak sadar melancarkan serangan terhadap Luo Zheng.

   


Sepasang kapak darah besar melintas darah, menyebarkan qi darah yang kuat, dua kapak besar melintas di bawah tegak, seolah-olah seseorang telah menusuk pernis dengan pena tinta, dan menguraikan lukisan tebal dan berwarna-warni di depannya. !

     !


"hu hu hu huh "

Setiap kapak melambai, dan penuh dengan momentum yang kuat!

Di bawah desakan darah perunggu, ofensif Tuan Muda Hao tidak memiliki gerakan, dan tidak perlu menggunakan gerakan!

   !


Di bawah pemotongan kasar seperti itu, itu seperti tanah longsor. Semuanya akan dimusnahkan dalam lingkup amplop. Tidak ada keraguan dan tidak ada pertimbangan!

     !


Secara umum, dalam menghadapi serangan semacam itu, sebagian besar Seniman Bela Diri akan memilih untuk kembali dan mencari peluang lagi.

   


Ini jelas bukan pilihan yang bijaksana untuk menghadapi Demon Race Martial Artist, terutama Demon Race Martial Artist, yang telah mengaktifkan Darah Perunggu!

   !


Namun, Luo Zheng tidak mundur.

Tidak peduli seberapa cepat kapak darah mengambil, sosok Luo Zheng selalu tiga inci jauhnya dari kapak darah.

 , 


Dia seperti kupu-kupu dalam badai, angin dapat menghancurkan rumah dan pohon, tetapi kupu-kupu kecil ini selalu menari dalam angin dan tidak pernah jatuh!

     !


Adegan ini tiba-tiba mengejutkan banyak Seniman Bela Diri yang bersembunyi di Kota Utama!

Kota Utama masih jauh dari Luo Zheng. Dari sudut pandang mereka, Luo Zheng seperti stiker di kapak darah.

   


This creates an illusion, as if the Young Master Hao didn't want to take the axe and Luo Zheng, but tried to get Luo Zheng down from the axe, but no matter how he went. Can't get rid of 

     


"This fellow, what did he do, how did he do it?"

"I guess he should be a very cultivation technique for cultivation, sticking himself to the blood hatchet!"

" , !"


"No, if it sticks to it, Young Master Hao just needs to squat on the ground. Is this brat not dead?"

"   , ?"


Many Demon Race Martial Artists on the wall looked at this scene in a daunting way.

 , 


However, their voices just fell, and Young Master Hao did just that. This illusion is not unique to other Martial Artists. Young Master Hao also has this strange feeling in his heart. This brat seems to stick to his own. Above the axe blade.

     


So he raised the pair of blood hatchets high, and he had to squat down!

 , !


However, under this circumstance, when Luo Zheng's body was still three inches away from the ground, he was squeezed out from the gap between the axe blade and the ground.

   


"Boom!"

The two handles of the blood hatchet embed were on the ground, and suddenly the ground was opened with a huge crack!

 , !


This crack spreads all the way to the front, extending all the way up ten miles away, called a small canyon!

   !


"This "

"This Human Race Martial Artist is really weird, it seems to be a slippery mud!"

" , !"


The Martial Artists on the wall are once again stunned!

At this moment, Luo Zheng's figure stands at the end of the blood hatchet, and his feet are still three inches away from the blood hatchet.

   


Even under the stimulation of the blood of bronze, Young Master Hao suspended the attack and couldn't help but look at this person!

   !


"It's you!"

At this moment, Young Master Hao recognized Luo Zheng.

It was one of the two Human Race Martial Artists before Dream Battlefield opened!

At that time, Young Master Hao was blind and did not expect that the two Human Race Martial Artists were so extraordinary that they killed 11 Demon Race Martial Artists in an instant.

   


But even so, Young Master Hao did not put these two people in mind.

In Young Master Hao's view, the real powerhouse will basically choose the way to block the city gate, brushing the dream points, the two Human Race Martial Artists choose to leave, it is estimated to be confident.

     


He did not know that the way to block the city gate would be relatively inefficient, and who would be willing to leave the city to die?

   ?


In the eyes of Luo Zheng's, Young Master Hao is a Martial Artist who uses "blocking the door" to obtain dream points, but it is a grazing sheep. Now that he has returned, he will inevitably choose to slaughter this sheep 

 , " "   , 


"It's me," Luo Zheng said with a faint smile on his face.

"haha, come well, I see where you can hide!"Young Master Hao laughed aloud. Although he was afraid of Luo Zheng's weird movement technique, he did not have any fear under the influence of the blood of the bronze. The pair of blood hatchets were staggered, and then they went up and down. Come.

"   !"     , 


If you are hit by these two blood hatchets, Luo Zheng will be directly cut into three!

This time, Luo Zheng did not choose to dodge!

After the white smoke on his body was scattered, Luo Zheng opened his hands and stared at the Young Master Hao, and his face still showed a faint smile.

   , 


"Brush!"

Luo Zheng's hands out like a snake, and at this moment they caught two axe blades of blood hatchet.

 , 


This Young Master Hao's two snipers are enough to break the ground!

Almost all Martial Artists believe that Luo Zheng will once again perform the weird movement technique for dodge.

 , 


However, this time Luo Zheng not only did not dodge, but directly reached out and grabbed the axe blade of Demon Race Martial Artist with bare hands! Luo Zheng's hands and fingers were deeply embed on the surface of the blood hatchet. This piece from the 1st Grade Divine Tool was directly dug out of his fingers with ten deep grooves.

   !   , 


On this side of Main City, suddenly it was quiet.

The Dewe Race Martial Artist's temperament is also huge, so the Demon Race Martial Artist's settlement is very noisy. With a little opening, the sound is loud and loud, and there are not many things that make them so quiet. !

     , !


There is something unreasonable in front of me.

This Human Race Martial Artist has actually caught the Young Master Hao's double axe!

The racial focus in the universe is different. It can be said that each race has its own strengths to the extreme.

 , 


Human Race is perfect for comprehension, Demon Race is for Body Refinement, and Monster Night Race is born to be strong, which one is good 

   , 


Demon Race Martial Artist will choose Body Refinement for 90%, and this Young Master Hao is the well-known figure in Demon Race Body Cultivator, but the Human Race brat looks like the Martial Artist of cultivation True Essence.

   


From the fact that he did not feel any True Essence fluctuations, he actually grabbed the two master hats of Young Master Hao by hand!

 , !


In the eyes of these demon clansman, it's a hell!

The frustration of the Domain that he is good at is easily defeated, and this setback is quite uncomfortable, and the blow is also very big.

   


Even worse, Luo Zheng's ten fingers even directly grab this piece from the 1st Grade Divine Tool!

 , !


This is from the 1st Grade Divine Tool The blood hatchet is huge and heavy, far stronger than swords, spears, knives and other weapons. With the axe under the rank, the hammer-type weapon consumes several times more material, and it is also a lot stronger.

       , 


The facts are in front of you, and many Demon Race Martial Artists shook their heads subconsciously, seemingly trying not to believe, but the eyes did not deceive themselves.

   , 


"How did he do it "

"There is no True Essence fluctuations, and this Human Race brat does not seem to cultivate the True Essence system!"

" , !"


"No, he is not a Body Cultivator, I don't feel the explosion of Astral Essence!"

Many Demon Race Martial Artists stared at Luo Zheng, and after a while of silence, they began to talk about it, and the voice was still very loud 

   


In this discussion, they came to a more terrible conclusion.

Luo Zheng just now did not rely on True Essence or Astral Essence. He used his fleshly body and his own power to block the two blood hatchets!

   , !


"Where is the freak out of the place "A Demon Race Martial Artist suddenly came up with such a sentence.

" " 


Compared to outsiders, Young Master Hao's horror is probably a myriad of times 

 , 


His deep blood of bronze is the orthodox successor of the Demon Race gold family. Although it is not comparable to the World Lord, Heavenly Venerate Successor, he is enough to become the core discipline of 10th Grade Holy Land! Both the talent and the bloodline are excellent.

     ! , 


After the outbreak of the bronze blood, he was able to increase his strength by more than three times. With the cultivation of Astral Essence, even the Divine Extremity Realm powerhouse couldn't help him!

   , !


But in front of this, the Human Race brat, which looks like a sturdy and burly, has just pinched his axe.

 , ?


He looked at the faint smile on Luo Zheng's face, and a deep humiliation rose from the bottom of his heart. It was terrible that he could not pull out the pair of blood hatchet!

   , !

Apotheosis Bab 1191

Otot coklat Tuan Muda Hao di lengannya terangkat tinggi, dan garis meridian di lengannya seperti ular kecil!   

 , !


Di antara mata merahnya, Qing Mang semakin kuat dan kuat, dan darah perunggu telah didorong ke ekstrim!

   !


Kekuatan ini ditempatkan di Alam Bawah, cukup untuk membalik gunung dan menghancurkan bumi.

   


Tapi kekuatan yang begitu kuat tidak bisa menarik kedua kapak dari tangan Luo Zheng!

 , !


Hampir sampai. Kekuatan bocah Ras Manusia ini seharusnya telah mencapai akhir yang kuat! "

" ...... , !"


Meski begitu, Tuan Muda Hao tidak memilih untuk menyerah!

"Turunkan aku!"

Tuan Muda Hao berteriak, tetapi melepaskan rencana untuk mengeluarkan kapak darah, tetapi ke arah yang berlawanan, sekali lagi meremas kapak darah ke arah tengah!

   , !


Kapak darah masih tidak bergerak. Kapak darah tampaknya telah sepenuhnya tertanam di tangan Luo Zheng. Rasanya seperti terintegrasi dengan Luo Zheng. Tidak peduli ke arah mana dia menggunakan kapak darah, tidak ada jawaban.

   , 


Hai ~

Luo Zheng tersenyum sedikit, dan tangan yang telah terjepit pada sepasang kapak darah tiba-tiba dipaksa.

 , 


"dentur "

Beberapa retakan mulai menyebar dengan cepat di antara Luo Zheng, dan dalam waktu singkat mereka menutupi seluruh kapak.

 , 


Pa

Segera setelah itu, kapak darah ini berubah menjadi bagian yang tak terhitung jumlahnya dalam tampilan penuh!

Adapun Tuan Muda Hao, memegang dua pegangan kapak telanjang dan berdiri di tempat yang kosong, kedua kapak itu berubah menjadi dua "tongkat pendek" dalam sekejap mata, yang benar-benar membuatnya tidak dapat menerima.

   " ", 


Dia tidak tertekan oleh kapak darah ini.

These two blood hatchets are of course the treasure of the family, but here is Dream Battlefield, Martial Artist wears weapons into it, Martial Artist itself is a projection, weapons are also projections, and can not be used in Dream Battlefield after damage, but There is no loss outside of Dream Battlefield. Because of this, in the Dream Battlefield, the Divine Tool and the Supreme Divine Tool in the Great Race also appeared. The Supreme Divine Tool, which originally belonged to the World Lord, Great World Lord and even Heavenly Venerate, was also Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist. Brought to Dream Battlefield!

           , !


What Young Master Hao can't accept is the strength of Luo Zheng's, and the strength of his hands!

 , !


A fellow that can be crushed directly from the 1st Grade Divine Tool 

This scene is like a lightning bolt, bombing in his head, he realized that he had met a monster.

   


Finished

Luo Zheng didn't want to waste too much time on Young Master Hao. He returned to Main City. His goal was to harvest wool, and Young Master Hao was clearly the first target Luo Zheng chose.

   , 


The strength of this Young Master Hao in Luo Zheng's view is that even the Heaven Splitting Rat is far worse.

 , 


Although the power of Young Master Hao is also extraordinary in Demon Race Martial Artist, but Luo Zheng has not lost with the realm Martial Artist, let alone the same realm, even Divine Extremity Realm powerhouse can not Confront the existence of it!

   , !


"Pu~"

With a crisp voice, Luo Zheng's finger was already on Young Master Hao's forehead, and then his huge head turned into a bloody fog, and the headless fleshly body fell backwards.

   , 


"Boom!"

After the burly body squatted on the ground, it began to slowly dissipate, and a red light trail was returned to the Main City.

   


At the same time, a large number of dream points escaped from the young master Hao's with the the body, these yellow spots quickly shot into Luo Zheng within the body, Luo Zheng's dream points are also increasing rapidly!

   , !


The Demon Race Martial Artist above the walls also has an envious color on his face.

This Young Master Hao had accumulated 70,000 dream points before, and now Luo Zheng kills this Young Master Hao once and can get half of the Dream points of Young Master Hao. This reward is not rich.

   , 


Prior to the hard work of Young Master Hao, half of them had been married to Luo Zheng.

 , 


"A total of 37,400 points Plus my previous accumulated dream points, now more than 40,000, in this side of Great World, the ranking is Five hundred and forty-two, in the Battle Battlefield ranking is 24 million "

"     "


This ranking is already very popular for many Martial Artists.

After all, this involves the competition of mega Martial Artist, and there is a huge amount of genius in front of Luo Zheng's!

 , !


But Luo Zheng also showed a bitter smile, he is not a star and a half behind, there are more than 20 million Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist in front of him.

   


After the inquiry, Luo Zheng's glanced at the Demon Race Martial Artist on the wall.

 , 


Before the Young Master Hao activated the blood of the bronze, these Demon Race Martial Artists did not dare to go out of the city. At this moment, facing Luo Zheng, where did they dare to leave the Main City?

   , ?


But the woods are big, what birds are there!

Some Martial Artists are not for the sake of rankings, nor for dream points. Their purpose in entering Dream Battlefield is to challenge and experience each time of life and death, trying to break through their shackles.

     


"sou sou "

Just when Luo Zheng was about to leave, three or four Demon Race Martial Artists rushed out of the wall, and these Demon Race Martial Artists went straight to Luo Zheng!

   !


Luo Zheng's looked at these Demon Race Martial Artists, Divine Sea Realm early stage cultivation base, and the talent is ordinary, not enough for Luo Zheng's opponent, but since the other party is willing to send dream points, Luo Zheng will refuse?

     , ?


These Martial Artists want to challenge Luo Zheng to understand the gap between themselves and the powerhouse.

 , 


Unfortunately, they are Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist, but the gap with Luo Zheng is still too big Even Divine Extremity Realm powerhouse, if it is talented, Luo Zheng can also kill, not to mention these talented Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist?

     ?


They barely saw how Luo Zheng took the action and was sent back to Main City by Luo Zheng.

 , 


After Luo Zheng killed these people, his eyes were a little worried 

Although he knows that these Divine Sea Realm Martial Artists have few dream points, they didn't expect it to be so few. Four Divine Sea Realm Martial Artists, only two dream points!

   , !


Two of them, one contributed a dream points, and the remaining two within the body are completely empty, there is no dream points at all!

   , !


Luo Zheng left the Main City at the beginning, naturally did not know the madness of the Martial Artist. After they resurrected, they immediately went out to find someone to kill. After death, they returned to Main City, then resurrected, then killed, then resurrected, without any rest. !

       , !


This is a group of cultivation madmen, they don't care about dream points at all, just open up with Dream Battlefield, give yourself a perfect experience, the more powerhouses you face, the better!

     !


Luo Zheng just after cooking the four Martial Artists, three people went straight to Luo Zheng.

 , 


Luo Zheng is not very interested in this. Although Luo Zheng can't judge how many dream points the opponent has, but with the momentum of these Martial Artists, it can roughly calculate the strength of the other side. The weak Martial Artist is destined not too More dream points!

     , !


So Luo Zheng stepped across the space, continually flashing along the Main City, and quickly dissipated in front of everyone.

   


When Luo Zheng left, the many Martial Artists on the wall were just a little lamented, and then they were once again active outside the city 

   


This Main City is not too small. After Luo Zheng rushed out of the distance, he once again encountered a "sheep". The strength of the Demon Race Martial Artist is almost the same as that of the Young Master Hao. The harvest of ordinary Martial Artist's dream points.

   " "  


But in the end, luck is not good, and I encountered Luo Zheng 

After a fierce battle, the Demon Race Martial Artist turned into a red spot and flew into the Main City.

   


Soon after returning to Main City, I met two "sheep", and luck was good. After absorbing nearly 30,000 dream points this time, the dream points of Luo Zheng within the body have accumulated to about 70, and the ranking has once again increased rapidly. The ranking in Great World has reached 410,000, and the total ranking in Dream Battlefield is 19 million!

 , " "      !


However, this ranking is still difficult to be noticed in countless sitting pyramids 

 , 


Previously, these Martial artists, under the hard work of killing, can kill 50 people with only one dream point. Now Luo Zheng kills one person is tens of thousands. The Martial Artist like Young Master Hao is indeed Live for the Martial Artist like Luo Zheng!

     , !


However, this returning Martial Artist is more than just Luo Zheng.

Rumput dimakan oleh domba, dan domba dimakan oleh serigala ...

Serigala seperti Luo Zheng sudah mulai kembali, dan hal pertama yang mereka kembali ke Kota Utama adalah membersihkan domba gemuk di luar kota.

   , 


Tetapi antara serigala dan serigala, jelas mustahil untuk menghindari pembunuhan. Segera setelah itu, Luo Zheng bertemu dengan serigala pertama.

   


Apotheosis Chapter 1192 - Comrade Mao

Throughout the Dream Battlefield, "Sheep" is constantly being eaten!   

 , " " !


Some of the original Martial Artist rankings began to drop rapidly 

And some of the previous rankings of the Martial Artist, the rankings began to rise rapidly!

 , !


All races pay close attention to the pyramid on the dream space, paying attention to the trend of ranking 

   


They are concerned about the names of the top geniuses of the Great Race, but in addition, many lifeforms are paying attention to one's name, which is Luo Zheng.

   , 


Now Luo Zheng is probably the most familiar name in the universe. Even the top geniuses of the Great Race, the son of Heavenly Venerate, the World Lord Successor can't compete with Luo Zheng.

   , 


The reason is simple, or because of Roaring Order 

In the universe of trillions of lifeforms, no one can escape the sound of the Roaring Order, the mysterious girl shouted the name "Luo Zheng" more than once.

   " " 


As for a few years ago, Luo Zheng was besieged by dozens of Heavenly Venerate, and even the killing of several Heavenly Venerate was once a rumor, but the whole universe was full of enthusiasm!

   , !


With such a well-known Martial Artist, Luo Zheng is probably only one person in the past, even if Heavenly Venerate can't.

   


The people who are looking for Luo Zheng are not only Yun Luo et al., Celestial Clan, but even many good people in the universe. They are constantly searching.

     


After all, Luo Zheng's reputation was too strong, and even many Heavenly Venerate were curious. How did Luo Zheng perform in Dream Battlefield?

   ?


However, this search has caused many people to feel disappointed 

The pyramids contain hundreds of millions of names, and the number is unimaginable. The names that are deposited below are even more indistinguishable.

   


The first few million are still okay, after all, the top ranked names have a lot of Dream points, and the distance between them is also relatively open!

   !


In order to find the name of Luo Zheng's, the good guys went all the way from the top of the pyramid, but it took a lot of effort to find Luo Zheng for thousands of names.

   , 


"This Luo Zheng, isn't there a Immortal Mansion with a calf? How can I not even enter 10 million? "

" , ? ?"


"It's very simple. This fellow is bullshit luck. I got the indestructible Immortal Mansion. I guess my talent is ten thousand. He he looks like this. Luo Zheng is not as good as a core Holy Land genius. "

"       "


"It is true that 10 million is a very low standard. It seems that there will be a disaster in this universe soon!"

"   !"


Disaster What disaster? "Someone is strangely said.

"You think, this Luo Zheng is so talented, trapped all the way in the Immortal Mansion, he must fall after tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, and the Immortal Mansion may become an unowned thing! Such an Immortal Mansion will not cause the looting of all Heavenly Venerate in the universe! I am afraid that no one will give up? "

"     ! ! ?"


"There is a certain reason for this inference "

The Martial Artists in the outside world, in addition to discussing the Martial Artist at the top of the ranking pyramid, discussed Luo Zheng.

   


With 70 dream points, 19 million, Luo Zheng is naturally dissatisfied with this ranking.

   


The return to Main City, Luo Zheng's bottom line is 300,000 dream points, this dream points can just open the cave in the wilderness 

   


But as Luo Zheng moves all the way around the walls of Main City, the smile on his face is getting more and more intense. Is there a problem with the rules of Dream Battlefield?

   ?


It's not Luo Zheng who doesn't want to kill people with dream points because he doesn't have this opportunity!

 , !


More and more wolves have returned, and the Martial Artist, which returns to Main City like Luo Zheng, is killing around Main City.

 , 


The size of this Main City is also huge, but the Martial Artists who have accumulated rich dream points have become smarter. Feel like Luo Zheng can't afford it. Can they always hide?

   , ?


So many "Martial Artists" who are "very well-off" are simply in the Main City and simply don't come out.

 " " , 


It is forbidden to fight in Main City, and Luo Zheng can't rush into Main City to kill!

Those Martial artists who have rich dream points break into Main City. There are still some "death squads" coming out to challenge Luo Zheng.

 , " " 


These fellows have no dream points, and many of them are provocative. Even after chasing after Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng has to bother to get rid of them!

   , !


"There is a bit of a problem with the design of this Dream Battlefield "

In general, this rule is not a big problem. Any Martial Artist who wants to stand out from the crowd must kill other Martial Artists. This is the big fish eating small fish, the small fish eating shrimp, the shrimp eating mud 

       


It is not a good haven to arrange Main City, which is unfair to Luo Zheng.

 , 


However, Dream Battlefield has only just begun. If all the people start to shrink in the city and cannot measure each other's strength, Dream Battlefield also lost its original intention. This rule should change soon.

     


Luo Zheng thought while walking around the Main City.

But just as he had just crossed the corner of the city wall, he saw a purple flame lingering on the head, and the violent explosion was transmitted in front.

   


"hu hu hu "

Then the wind pressure generated by the fierce bombing sounds, there is actually a blue wind blade! I can imagine how fierce the just now explosion is!

 , ! !


After the light strips slowly disappeared, a large pit appeared under the front wall, which is a large pit with a width of about 1.000 zhang (3330m) and a depth of several hundred feet 

   , 


Above the wall, many Demon Race Martial Artists are also looking at the big pit, and there is a purple flame rising from the big pit.

   


"This Long Qin is not the successor of the magic flame world, he seems to have cultivation of the purple return to the extreme! The power of just being is really exaggerated! "

" , ! !"


"Oh, how unpredictable Bai Ze has just returned, killing seven people in an hour, accumulating nearly 200,000 Dream points I did not expect Long Qin to kill Bai Ze, only used three strokes! Three strokes! "

"     ! !"


"The strongest Martial Artist in our city is estimated to be non-Long Qin!"

Many of the Martial Artists in the wall are staring at the big pit, and these sounds are naturally passed on to Luo Zheng's ears.

   


"Long Qin "

The name is not important, but Luo Zheng has heard a very important message. This Long Qin seems to be one step faster than Luo Zheng. In a short period of time, it has accumulated 200,000 dream points. This speed is indeed faster than Luo Zheng. A lot.

     


In fact, before Luo Zheng, there were already many Martial Artists returning to Main City. After getting some dream points, they quickly hid into the Main City. When Luo Zheng came back, the sheep were basically washed again. ! So Luo Zheng came along this road and only encountered two "sheep".

     ! , " " 


Soon after, a slightly thin figure will slowly rise from the pit!

 , !


This person is the Long Qin in the crowd. At his feet, the purple magic flame turns into a giant hand and lifts this Long Qin.

   


Although Long Qin is also a Demon Race Martial Artist, his body is not as tall as demon clansman. Although he is still more burly than humans, he is a "pocket" in the majestic demon clansman.

   , " " 


When Long Qin emerged from the cave, his eyes glanced around and looked at the many Martial Artists who were huddled in the walls, and his face was mocking!

   , !


These gangs, even if they take the initiative to go out of the city, he is too lazy to kill!

But when Long Qin's gaze swept all the way along the edge of the wall and extended to the end of the wall, he saw a figure floating around the corner.

   


It is Luo Zheng who is wearing an azure clothed!

This Long Qin's face suddenly showed a little doubt, why did the Human Race Martial Artist not hide in the wall?

 , ?


His Long Qin is the successor of the magical flame world. Conquering the Main City is just a negligible goal. He wants to collide with the real top powerhouse in this Dream Battlefield!

   !


From the beginning to the end, Long Qin never put this Main City in his eyes, and did not put the Martial Artist in the Main City in his eyes.

   


So when he saw that Luo Zheng had never escaped himself, he was so puzzled that this Human Race Martial Artist would not be scared by himself.

   ?


Long Qin was wondering, but he saw Luo Zheng flew slowly toward him, with a sly smile on his face 

   


Apotheosis Chapter 1193 - Comrade Mao

The smile on Luo Zheng's face is undoubtedly dazzling in Long Qin's eyes.   

 , 


Human Race is a very powerful race in the universe, but Demon Race Martial Artist is the absolute mainstream in this Main City!

 , !


Other races were unintentionally assigned to the Main City, but they were all guns.

 , 


Today's Long Qin stands here, and thousands of Martial Artists in Main City simply don't dare to take a step Is this Human Race youth in front of me an idiot?

   ?


Luo Zheng's smile is indeed a bit glaring at this moment.

Long Qin didn't know that although he was one of the predators in the Main City, he was a big fat sheep in the eyes of Luo Zheng's. At this moment, Luo Zheng was afraid that Long Qin would escape to the Main City.

   , 


200,000 dream points, half of the 100,000 points, and Luo Zheng now has more than 70 dream points!

   !


"Where did the Human Race Martial Artist come out and go straight to Long Qin?"

"Don't you die?"

"I know this fellow, after he killed Young Master Hao in the southwest! It is also a powerful character! Unarmed and broken, Young Master Hao's double axe! That is the 1st Grade Divine Tool! "

" , ! ! ! !"


The 1st Grade Divine Tool is nothing in the eyes of Luo Zheng.

But in the eyes of many Divine Sea Realm Martial Artists, it is a treasure that can be met.

"Is this fellow so arrogant?"

When I heard this, the Demon Race Martial Artist in the city also looked at Luo Zheng.

"Even so, he is not an opponent of Long Qin, they Not a level of strength, Long Qin has learned his own Profound Truth in the Law of Fire, he even provoked Long Qin, I am afraid that my dream points are too much! "

"     , !"


Between this discussion, a small number of Human Race Martial Artists also flashed a glimmer of light!

 , !


These Human Race Martial Artists are inadvertently assigned to this Main City and can only recognize unlucky. Although Dream Battlefield is independent of race and strength, these Demon Race Martial Artists are also killing each other. However, a small number of Human Race Martial Artists will be considered as the first target without leaving the Main City.

       


The Human Race Martial Artist in the Main City is indeed weaker, and the race is different, and it is indeed more vulnerable.

   


I heard that the Human Race youth had such strength, and they felt that they had some brilliance on their faces, which helped them to breathe a sigh of relief.

   


But now they saw the battle of Long Qin, but they were inevitably worried about Luo Zheng. After all, Long Qin showed too much strength. The strength of this Human Race youth may be quite good, but I am afraid to fight against Long Qin. Still too reluctant 

     


There are more and more Martial Artists gathered on the walls.

They also want to see if there is any reliance on this Human Race youth, so dare to pick Long Qin like this?

   ?


Outside the city wall, the eyes of both of them are locked on the other side. Both of them have concerns in their hearts, but they are afraid of fighting each other and fleeing into the city!

     !


But as the distance between the two is getting closer, the double just now finds that the worry is superfluous!

 , !


They all saw strong self-confidence in the eyes of both sides. This kind of self-confidence was not deliberately pretended. This kind of self-confidence is the self-confidence accumulated in the battles and dissolved into the bones.

   , 


"I don't know where your confidence comes from," when the distance between the two sides was only 100 feet, Long Qin said a faint opening, staring at Luo Zheng's eyes, revealing a hint of sarcasm, "but Fighting with me will make you understand what is called despair You should be glad to be here at Dream Battlefield, at least you won't fall. "

" ,"   ,"   "


Luo Zheng looked calm and smiled and said: "You can be overestimate one's capabilities."

Long Qin's fine flash in the eyes, a majestic momentum suddenly released, in this momentum contains his understanding of the Law of Flame, so even if only the momentum of the manifestation, it gives a very hot feeling Standing in front of Long Qin is like being in the hot sun melting pot!

     , !


"Interesting human Martial Artist "

As soon as the voice fell, Long Qin suddenly reached out and gently raised a purple flame in his hand. As he gently squeezed his hand, the flame suddenly went out.

     


At the same time that the purple flame went out, in the range of thousand feet (333 m) around Luo Zheng, there was a group of purple flames born at the same time, and Long Qin's face was a faint smile, a moment of stepping, and a sudden on the back. Rising up the blazing flame, the flame is divided into two pieces and turned into a purple flame wing, just like Dapeng wings spread straight toward Luo Zheng!

       , !


In the face of Long Qin's culling, Luo Zheng's figure seems a bit arrogant. In the eyes of everyone, he seems to want to avoid Long Qin's edge, but both speed and choice are in a different direction!

     !


That Long Qin's fist was on Luo Zheng, and suddenly burst into a group of purple flames!

 , !


Then in the purple flame, a figure was popped out like a sharp arrow, and it was heavy under the ground.

   


"Hong!"

A loud noise came, and the figure took out a big pit on the ground.

After the purple flame dissipated, Long Qin's figure still floated in the air, and the natural thing that was smashed down was Luo Zheng 

   


"Oh, I thought that this Human Race Martial Artist has two more brushes, and it seems that even Bai Ze is far worse!"

"   !"


"A fist is defeated, this Long Qin has not yet played his Profound Truth "

"Unspeakable, it doesn't mean anything!"

Long Qin didn't pursue it. He looked down on the big pit underneath with sarcasm, but his heart also raised a trace of doubt.

   


In general, the talented Martial Artist intuition is often more sensitive. It can judge the strength of the opponent from the confidence, tolerance and expression of the opponent. This judgment is not absolute, but often it can also break a pretty close. .

     , 


Although Long Qin looked down on Luo Zheng, the cool expression of Luo Zheng gave him a touch of pressure.

 , 


He is ridiculous, but he only despise this person strategically, but he is not sloppy on the tactics. Just now take action, he actually didn't keep it!

     !


This trick "Soaring Phoenix Flame Dragon" looks faint, but the power is extraordinary 

 " " , 


Now it seems that the effect is really good, at least this Luo Zheng did not evade him, but Long Qin faintly felt something wrong.

   


Maybe it's just nervous about yourself 

Long Qin faintly looked at the Human Race Martial Artist below. At this moment, Luo Zheng has climbed out of the big pit. The expression is staring at himself, and there seems to be a disobedient color in his eyes.

   , 


"he he, don't look at me with that kind of look," Long Qin's figure swayed slightly, and the two purple flame wings re-opened behind him. "Compared to your previous accumulation of a lot of dream points But in my opinion, you are just a sheep, and I am a wolf "

"  "  "   "


As he said, the figure flashed again, and there was a flame path in the place he had passed!

   !


Looking at the fast-paced Long Qin, Luo Zheng has a hint of crafty in the depths of his eyes 

 , 


Accumulating dream points, it is not difficult for Luo Zheng's, but the comparison of the rules of Dream Battlefield is scam people. He can really take half of Dream points in this game, but if this Long Qin loses to himself I am afraid I will always hide in the city!

     , !


Long Qin has a lot of Dream points, and Luo Zheng wants to give Long Qin a reason, a reason not to admit defeat.

   


"Hong!"

Luo Zheng figure once again, seems to want to try his best to avoid the cull of Long Qin, but the second time still can not avoid!

   !


With a burst of purple flames exploding, Luo Zheng's figure is once again flying out, hitting the wall above 

   


This wall was built by the rules of Dream Battlefield. It was naturally indestructible. With such a violent impact, it failed to crash the wall. Luo Zheng was flat on the wall.

     


Even though Luo Zheng's fleshly body is as strong as Divine Tool, the fleshly body hits the wall like this, without any cushioning, with the body is also a bloody tumbling, just for acting, Luo Zheng has to endure!

     , !


"Not dead yet? There are two brushes "

Long Qin sighed slightly. He thought that Luo Zheng would directly crash on the wall. The fellow's fleshly body should be talented. Unfortunately, the pure fleshly body is not useful, but it is a target of his beating. .

     


Did not think much, Long Qin once again rushed to Luo Zheng!

"Hong!"

"Hong!"

"Hong!"

After several impacts, the Martial Artists on the wall were also amazed.

Luo Zheng's live target is too bad 

However, just after Long Qin rushed to Luo Zheng's moment, Luo Zheng's mouth showed an invisible smile.

 , 


Almost

Apotheosis Chapter 1194 - Comrade Mao

Just when this Long Qin was processed in the same way, the wings were again released and flew toward them.   

 , 


So arbitrarily venting his power, using Luo Zheng as a target, it is a little fun for Long Qin!

   !


But this time, Luo Zheng did not try to avoid Long Qin's attack, but chose to confront in the front, his left hand flipped slightly, and his right hand was on one side!

     !


Pick up your hand 

Many Martial Artists saw this scene and their faces were once again weird.

Demon Race Martial Artist is mostly Body Refinement. This is the most basic martial arts, which can be classified as basic boxing!

   !


I hope to rely on my hand to give Long Qin a hand?

They are increasingly feeling that Luo Zheng has a problem with his brain 

Long Qin is also coldly laughing, the wings behind him are slightly unfolding, flying in the air is more elegant, and the speed is accelerated to the extreme, it is heading towards Luo Zheng!

     !


Although the strength shown by Luo Zheng is not vulnerable, the vigilance of Long Qin has not been reduced.

 , 


He simply does not believe that Luo Zheng has such strength!

But no matter what kind of tricks this fellow plays, Long Qin thinks that it is meaningless to play tricks under absolute power.

   


Finished

As he rushes to Luo Zheng, the purple flame in his hand is like a wild flower growing quickly!

 , !


But at this time, Luo Zheng's right hand was like a lightning bolt, and with one hand gently pinched, it was the direct annihilation of that purple flame.

   , 


Then the left hand was like a snake, screwing Long Qin's arm, and with the pressure of Luo Zheng's arm, the unfathomable power quietly emerged!

   , !


"ka ca !"

A clear and audible crack came.

This Long Qin's arm is directly twisted by Luo Zheng's with one hand!

Long Qin's face flashed an incredible color, and another hand showed a flame again, and wanted to squat again toward Luo Zheng!

   !


However, Luo Zheng was concocted according to law, and his right hand once again annihilated the flame with lightning speed, and also seized the remaining hand of Long Qin!

   !


Under this grasp, Long Qin felt that he was caught by a pair of pliers, and there was almost no possibility of moving.

   


Seeing this scene from the wall, the many Martial Artists onlookers are even more confused.

 , 


At the level of Divine Sea Realm, the two sides compete for either the True Essence-understood technique or the martial skill.

   


It's a bit ridiculous that Luo Zheng's sudden display of his hand, why is this Long Qin also playing with Luo Zheng? The two are so entangled, is this going to compete?

 , ? , ?


They did not know, Long Qin also secretly complained, although Long Qin guessed that Luo Zheng must have his own trump card, but Long Qin never thought that Luo Zheng's trump card turned out to be the power of his fleshly body?

     ?


Where is this fellow coming from such terrifying power!

Long Qin's size is a relatively small existence in Demon Race, but it is still more than twice as large as Luo Zheng. It is indeed a very strange thing to be taken by Luo Zheng.

   " " , 


But Luo Zheng did not give him time to think.

This Long Qin is also considered Body and Essence Dual Cultivation. In addition to the cultivation Law of Fire, Body Refinement is also very powerful!

   !


Luo Zheng has no chance to show him!

Long Qin is still wondering, when planning a counter-attack strategy, a force ten times larger than before has been passed from Luo Zheng's arm!

   !


With such a mighty power, Long Qin has no resistance at all, or he has no time to resist.

   


Soon he felt the pain of a heartbreaking pulse. He was twice as big as Luo Zheng, and he was shredded by Luo Zheng 

   


As a red spot of light flew into the Main City, the dense dream points emerged from the fleshly body that Long Qin disappeared. These yellow spots were quickly rushing toward Luo Zheng within the body. !

   !


10,000

fifty thousand 

100,000

140,000!

Originally Luo Zheng thought that this Long Qin within the body had only 200,000 dream points. He killed this person once and should get 100,000 Dream points.

   


I did not expect this fellow to accumulate nearly 300,000 Dream points.

Luo Zheng within the body originally accumulated "70, after absorbing the 140,000, the dream points with the body is suddenly shot to 210,000!

   !


As for the many Martial Artists on the wall, they did not envy Luo Zheng, and most of the Martial Artist faces doubts.

   


Just now, they can't even evaluate it because they didn't understand it at all.

   


This Luo Zheng had been beaten up before, how could the two of them fight together, and then Long Qin was suddenly shredded by Luo Zheng?

   ?


This kind of battle has violated common sense.

After a while, only one Demon Race Martial Artist said: "Long Qin is a good man Did not show his strength at all! "

 , :" !"


"It is estimated that Long Qin is very reluctant!"

Should beHis true strength has not been displayed at all! "

"I definitely want to find this Human Race Martial Artist after his resurrection."

Upon hearing this, Luo Zheng's face showed another faint smile.

What he wants is this effect.

This Long Qin has so many dream points, just killing it once is too wasteful.

   


Luo Zheng had previously shown weakness, not to want to paralyze Long Qin, in order to find its unintentional defeat, Long Qin's strength is good, but Luo Zheng is still not in the eye.

     


In this Dream Battlefield, there may be a Martial Artist that Luo Zheng can't beat, even defeating Luo Zheng!

   !


After all, the universe is too big, and Luo Zheng is already very good, but the strength of the super geniuses in the universe can not be underestimated. Just like the original Ai Anxin, Luo Zheng may be able to suppress her in all directions in Xin Huo Inheritance. The strength is definitely a little better, but it is not easy to beat Ai Anxin. Besides, there are many supreme talents in the universe. They are more powerful than Ai Anxin, with more rich heritage and legacy.

         , 


The battle outside the Main City is just a step in the early days of Dream Battlefield.

 , 


Luo Zheng does not expect to learn from these battles and let himself grow. His only purpose is to know points.

   


Luo Zheng showed weakness before, so that Long Qin came back and forth to have a good time. At this moment, he was very ordinary and used to kill him with his own strength.

   , 


This Long Qin must be very unconvinced, with his heritage, there must be a lot of trump card failed to display, the heart is inevitably unwilling, this time he will return to Main City after the resurrection, I am afraid I will challenge myself again.

     


This gave Luo Zheng the second chance to kill Long Qin.

Although I killed it once, I have already got half of Dream Points from Long Qin, but if this person still has 140,000 dream points and kills it once again, Luo Zheng can get "70!

     !


Hello?Do you want to go to the city to hide? If Long Qin is resurrected, he will definitely come to you! "

" , ? , !"


It's a Human Race Martial Artist. Most people think that Luo Zheng's win is inexplicable. In my heart, it's also a guess. Luo Zheng should be lucky enough to win.

   , 


This Human Race Martial Artist is kind, but worried about Luo Zheng, who just got a lot of Dream points. If he was taken back by the Long Qin, it would be a big loss.

     


Upon hearing this kind reminder, Luo Zheng just smiled and nodded at the Human Race Martial Artist. He did not move his steps. He still stood outside the city, looking at the direction of Main City and waiting quietly. .

       


Among the Main City, a red spot slowly floats among them.

As the red light spot continued to flutter, it began to grow slowly, gradually changing from the fingertip-sized spot to the size of the fist, and then rapidly expanding to form a light-sized group of light. The group is full of strong Law of Life!

     , !


The resurrection of Dream Battlefield is somewhat different from the dream space.

After death in dream space, it will be kicked out of space, and Martial Artist will enter it again, which is another projection.

   , 


On the top of Dream Battlefield, after the death of Martial Artist, it relied on the power of Heavenly Dao to complete the "resurrection" of Martial Artist, so some Martial Artists discovered that this light group is full of strong Law of Life and simply does not leave the city. In addition, I was looking for these resurrected light groups and realized the Law of Life 

   " "    


Anyway, there is a constant death outside the Main City, and there are people who are resurrected. There is a red light group in the Main City. This is also a cultivation opportunity for many Martial Artists who have no chance to enlighten the high Source Law.

     


Soon after, this light group slowly condensed a Daoist Shadow!

After the Daoist Shadow was completely agglomerated, the body suddenly stunned, and the light group was drilled. The sly glance at the Martial Artist around the Law of Life, and then flew away from the city!

     !


Apotheosis Chapter 1195 - Comrade Mao

Untuk Long Qin, ini sangat memalukan!   

 , !


Dia dibunuh oleh Seniman Bela Diri Manusia dengan cara yang sederhana sehingga kemarahan di hatinya sulit untuk ditekan.

   


Alasannya adalah karena kekuatan Luo Zheng terlalu kuat, dengan basis budidaya Long Qin saat ini, ia masih tidak bisa menahan kekuatan Luo Zheng.

   , 


Namun, ini tidak berarti bahwa Long Qin akan kalah dari Luo Zheng!

Tubuh daging, Kekuatan Ilahi bawaan, dua talenta ini tidak layak disebut di Long Qin!

   !


Dia belum menggunakan Long Qin dan kemampuannya yang luar biasa, dan dia juga menyadari Kebenaran Mendalam dalam Hukum Api, yang merupakan Kebenaran Mendalamnya sendiri! Di satu sisi, itu dapat dianggap sebagai Hukum Karma yang dia sadari ...

   ! , 


Tetapi dengan begitu banyak cara, ia gagal menampilkannya, dan ia terbunuh oleh Artis Bela Diri Manusia. Terus terang, ia mendung oleh Luo Zheng ...

   , 


Bagaimana dia bisa bersedia Long Qin?

Jadi setelah dia dibangkitkan, dia langsung bergegas keluar kota!

Sekarang Long Qin khawatir bahwa Artis Bela Diri Manusia bersembunyi di Kota Utama.

Namun, ketika Long Qin masih dalam keadaan jiwa, dia sudah memikirkannya. Tidak peduli di mana bocah bersembunyi, dia akan mengambilnya!

   , !


Kecuali Artis Bela Diri Manusia Ras ini menyerahkan akumulasi poin mimpi, ia akan mengikuti bocah sepanjang jalan.

 , 


Tapi biarkan Long Qin bergegas ke dinding, dan matanya setajam mata tajam elang, tapi itu sedikit pandangan.

   


Luo Zheng, tidak jauh dari sana, mengapung di udara. Tampaknya dia belum menghapusnya sejak dia bunuh diri.

   ?


Pada saat ini, Luo Zheng juga menemukan Long Qin, dengan sedikit kelengkungan di sudut mulutnya, menunjukkan senyum tipis pada Long Qin!

   !


Melihat wajah Luo Zheng, api amarah tidak hanya diisi dengan dadanya, tetapi juga mengalir ke dalam benaknya!

   !


Long Qin tidak ragu-ragu untuk melompat dari dinding, pada saat yang sama, sepasang sayap api ungu tiba-tiba melompat, panjang sepasang sayap api memperpanjang jarak ribuan kaki, dibungkus dengan Luo Zheng pergi bersama!

     , !


In fact, in normally, Long Qin is a very alert Martial Artist!

In the magical flame world, the competition is also fierce. Long Qin can become the World Lord Successor in the magical flame world, relying on more than just talent!

   , !


It was only at the beginning that Long Qin regarded Luo Zheng as a "sheep", but now he is eaten by Luo Zheng 

 " ", 


It can be said that Luo Zheng has successfully angered Long Qin and made him lose his senses.

Martial Artist, who is under anger, tends to be stronger and even able to play beyond his own strength!

   !


Long Qin's attack is like a long-awaited storm, and it's going to happen.

   


"Long Qin is really angry "

"This Human Race Martial Artist is really calm, I don't know what it is!"

"Is it true that this Human Race brat has other dependencies? Really not afraid of Long Qin? "

" , ? ?"


Luo Zheng looked at Long Qin's offensive, but the figure was still motionless, but even the most attentive Martial Artist did not notice that there was a faint white halo beneath the ground.

   , 


He calculated the time and started to extract the Qi of Primal Chaos and converted it into the "Thunder Tribulation Kill" array, which was quietly buried under the ground!

   , !


"brat, I will let you know, what is called reverse purgatory fire!"

"Peng!"

After that, Long Qin's momentum suddenly changed, and a faint red-colored six-pointed star appeared from his eyebrows.

   


As the red six-pointed star slowly turned, a huge power seemed to be condensing 

 , 


However, Long Qin's offensive has not yet been brewed, and many of the city's Martial Artists feel a bit wrong, and this is not the right thing from the sky!

   , !


A powerful world of heaven and earth is passed from above!

At the same time, the dense Dao Accumulation rule in the sky began to condense!

 , !


This thing is no stranger to the Martial Artists present.

The Martial Artists throughout Dream Battlefield are Divine Sea Realm cultivation bases. They have experienced at least a few Small Heavenly Tribulations and have experienced one or two Big Heavenly Tribulations!

   !


"How come Heavenly Tribulation comes out?"

"Can you transcends tribulation in Dream Battlefield No, right? "

"If you can transcends tribulation in Dream Battlefield, isn't that cool? There is no risk of falling here "

" , ? "


For Luo Zheng, the transcends tribulation may not be as difficult for many supreme talents in the universe, but for many of the common Divine Sea Realm Martial Artists, transcends tribulation is still very dangerous, with little attention or The risk of falling.

     , 


They saw this coming Thunder Tribulation, the first reaction was someone in the transcends tribulation!

 , !


The vision that emerged above the sky not only attracted these Martial Artists on the wall, but even attracted the attention of the Martial Artist in the entire Main City!

   !


All Martial Artists are curious for the first time, how can anyone have transcends tribulation here?

 , ?


As for Long Qin, after the anger has begun to gain momentum, intends to launch the most violent attack, killing this Luo Zheng over and over again! As long as he dares to leave the city, Long Qin will kill him once, until the dream points of the person are not snatched back!

   , !   !


But anger is angry, even though Long Qin is now angry, he still notices the vision above the sky.

   


Someone transcends tribulation?

He didn't think much about it under a slight glimpse. He was going to dispose of this Luo Zheng first!

 , !


There are thousands of changes in the fire, and the heart of the water is enlightened. The prison fire self-burning, turning to the potential of the Universe, to practice 

     


This anti-infernal fire is the Profound Truth that Long Qin learned from the Law of Fire. The whole universe is only one!

 , !


The general flame can be divided into two layers, namely the outer flame and the inner flame.

But at this moment, a very special flame has risen from Long Qin's eyebrows. This flame has changed from the outer layer to the inner layer, which means that the flame is divided into six layers.

   , 


If you look carefully, you can also find that this is also a very beautiful flame, but this magnificent flame also contains the power of terrifying!

   !


In the years of Long Qin's experience, the reversal of the fire has never been defeated!

 , !


However, this flame is still completely brewed, and a huge roar has been heard in the sky.

 , 


"Boom!"

A sly in the clear sky has already appeared in the sky!

Even if this thunder appeared, it could not stop Long Qin's offensive. He didn't mean that Heavenly Dao was yelling at himself. It can be said that Long Qin at the moment only has Luo Zheng. As for this Heavenly Tribulation Anyway, it is not his transcends tribulation, he just ignored this Heavenly Tribulation.

     , 


But ignoring the danger is a price to pay. When Long Qin is ready to go, the Human Race Martial Artist will be burned to ashes, and at this time, the power of Thunder Tribulation is like a white practice. Watered directly from the air, covering Long Qin.

       


The Martial Artists who saw this scene couldn't help but scream in the eyelids 

"This Heavenly Tribulation is actually for Long Qin "

"Is Heavenly Tribulation the one that Human Race Martial Artist brought?"

"How is it possible, you heard who can motivate Heavenly Tribulation? Will it be the punishment of Heavenly Dao when not all of the cultivation base breaks? "

" , ? , ?"


Heavenly Tribulation is Heavenly Dao's powerful, unforgiving punishment for the Martial Artist. How could this Heavenly Dao be so stupid and easily led down?

   , ?


The Martial Artists present, this kind of cultivation technique is unheard of, and naturally some don't believe it 

   


But this thing is just so happening?

Luo Zheng is waiting here, Long Qin just rushed out at this time, this Heavenly Tribulation is just here?

   ?


There are so many things happening under the sun!

After the Thunder Tribulation disappeared completely, Long Qin's figure also dissipated, and a red spot of light flew back to the city again At the same time, a little yellow dream points were once again in the body by Luo Zheng.

   , 


Long Qin was previously killed by Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng got 140,000 dream points, and now it is once again killed, Luo Zheng once again won "70.

   , 


Equal to Luo Zheng, on this person, they got 210,000 dream points 

 , 


"I don't know if this fellow will come, 30,000 dream points, not a small amount," Luo Zheng really thought so faintly.

"   ," 


As for the many Martial Artists onlookers, looking at Luo Zheng's smile that shows the harmlessness of humans and animals, my heart is chilling, and now they can be sure, just now that Heavenly Tribulation is mostly led by Luo Zheng, this Human Race Martial How did Artist do it?

     , ?


Apotheosis Chapter 1196 - Comrade Mao

Among the Martial Artists on the wall, there are also some powerhouses hidden among them, and there are even some more Martial Artists than Long Qin.   

   


These powerhouses are much more calm than the angry Long Qin.

When Luo Zheng first killed Long Qin and got 140,000 dream points, there were some powerhouses who couldn't help but want to go out and challenge Luo Zheng.

   , 


They are also constantly evaluating the strength of Luo Zheng's in their hearts, and even several Demon Race Martial Artists secretly negotiate whether they should take action together.

 , 


However, Luo Zheng always gave them a feeling of unfathomable feeling, and finally dispelled the idea.

 , 


Now that Long Qin was killed by Luo Zheng for the second time, they also raised a glimpse of luck. Fortunately, they did not take action before, but they saw that Luo Zheng was interested in this 

   , 


Being able to play Long Qin between the applause, the strength of Luo Zheng hidden under the water, I am afraid it is not just that.

   


Luo Zheng is still floating in the air, and her face still has a smile, and this smile is more and more unexpected in the eyes of many Martial Artists.

   , 


Soon after, a figure in the city rushed again, it was Long Qin who was killed twice by Luo Zheng!

   !


It's an unforgivable mistake to stumble twice in one place. At this moment, Long Qin's mood is so bad that it's almost uncontrollable!

   , !


This is also the gap between Upper Realm Martial Artist and Lower Realm Martial Artist.

Lower Realm Martial Artist's resources, even Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi, are not comparable to Upper Realm Martial Artist, but they have made more effort than the Upper Realm Martial Artist to get out of Great Thousand World and fly up to Upper Realm. It takes a lot of time to spend!

     !


For example, Lower Realm's Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist, which can be called "Great Expert", is already a top-notch in the Great Thousand World, and their cultivation to Divine Sea Realm is much more time-consuming than the Upper Realm Martial Artist. There are countless times.

 , " "  


But Demon Race supreme talent like Long Qin coincides with the Grand Generation Tournament of Fate. The cultivation speed is countless times faster. Their Heart of Martial Dao has not experienced the test of years, and even the dangers are very small. Far more powerful than Ascender, but the state of mind is far worse.

       


This kind of failure, placed on Long Qin, he is absolutely unacceptable. Now that Long Qin is like an angry beast, it is no longer important to lose Dream points. All he has to do is to vent the Human Race Martial Artist. Tearing, can you vent your anger!

       , !


"Get away!"

Under Long Qin's embarrassment, the Martial Artists gathered around the city walls opened a gap, and they watched Long Qin jump up and climb the city wall, and then rushed out of the city wall with this force!

     !


When he completed this series of actions, he did not even lock his target 

 , 


Seeing this scene, some of the powerhouses hidden in the crowd are also secretly sighing. If Long Qin can suppress his anger, he still has a chance to win in the face of Luo Zheng. Now his Heart of Martial Dao has Chaos, this rushing out can only give dream points to the Human Race brat!

     , !


As expected!

When Long Qin rushed out of the city wall, he suddenly realized that Luo Zheng disappeared?

   ?


Under the anger, he only wanted to leave the city first, then kill Luo Zheng, but he did not notice the direction of Luo Zheng!

   , !


Just as Long Qin wandered in the air, a faint voice came, which is Luo Zheng!

   !


At this moment, Luo Zheng floats on the top of Long Qin's head, his eyes are light, and the thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword flashes a blue gold light 

   


"You said that you are a wolf. I agree with this statement." Luo Zheng's smiled a little on his face. Between the words, Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword has already risen high. "However, you are only a relatively weak wolf at best. Nothing!"

"  "   ," , !"


As I said, Luo Zheng's sword has been slamming down!

However, when the blade came to Long Qin's back neck, it was slightly biased, but it was shot at the back neck of Long Qin with the sword!

 , !


Pa

A crisp sound came along, and with Long Qin's sullenness, this Long Qin plunged down to the bottom and saw it fall into the ground.

   , 


But at this moment, Luo Zheng took a step and the figure suddenly disappeared. At the same time, across the space, he first appeared on the side of Long Qin, looking up at Long Qin, the sword was slightly lifted again. Up, "As for you saying that I am a sheep, I can't agree with this sentence!"

       ," , !"


Pa

After that, Luo Zheng shot again with a sword, it is like playing cricket, the side of this sword is turned to Long Qin!

   , !


With this crisp loud noise, Long Qin rolled in the air and flew away from the sky 

   


Continuously beaten by Luo Zheng, Long Qin is also afraid of the seven-six-seven, although he heard the sound of Luo Zheng's clearly, but at this moment he did not even have the opportunity to open!

   , !


After slamming Long Qin up, Luo Zheng's figure flashed again, but it took a step. The figure reappeared over Long Qin. The smile on his face continued: "I am not a sheep, maybe Not a wolf I am, a lion eating a wolf! "

     :"   !"


After that, Luo Zheng's rays of light greatly rises, this time Luo Zheng no longer keeps a hand, a staunch momentum broke out in the sword, and Luo Zheng itself turned into a ruthless killing!

     !


There is a terrifying Sword Intent in a sword light, going straight to Long Qin!

At this moment, Long Qin, like Luo Zheng's plaything, was photographed by Luo Zheng, where is there room for resistance?

   , ?


Under this sword, Luo Zheng is the third time to kill Long Qin!

This kind of thing sounds amazing enough!

After all, Dream Battlefield's Martial Artist is backed by Main City, but it is enough to escape to the Main City. How can a fool be rushed out and let others kill?

   , ?


But Luo Zheng did it!

Killing Long Qin three times, Luo Zheng got 140,000 dream points for the first time, and "70 for the second time, and halved for the third time, it was more than 30,000 dream points Coupled with previous dream points, the number of Dream points in Luo Zheng has reached more than 310,000.

     , 


Then Luo Zheng re-queried his ranking!

After absorbing this Long Qin's dream points, Luo Zheng's ranking is rising rapidly!

 , !


Previously Luo Zheng had only "70, ranked 410,000 in this world, and ranked 19 million in the entire Dream Battlefield!

   !


But this time Luo Zheng, the ranking in this world has been around 80,000, the entire Dream Battlefield ranking is more than 3.9 million This is the first time Luo Zheng has entered a million!

   !


Among the outside world, the focus on the pyramid is also limited to the first five million 

Being among the 100,000 Great Worlds, the top five million can be called excellent, after all, this is the first five million of a trillion.

   


Of course, using excellent to describe Luo Zheng is obviously inappropriate. He ranks in this ranking, but the speed of collecting dream points is slower 

     


At this moment, all the Martial Artists of Vast Cloud Heavenly Palace are gathered in front of the pyramid, watching the pyramid of countless names, looking up and down the name on the pyramid.

   , 


"First place, or Xuanyuan Chenfeng of Thoughtless Gods!"

"This Xuanyuan Chenfeng is the Dao Child of Thoughtless Gods! It is said that he relied on the great means of Primeval Sin Heavenly Venerate to swallow a Heavenly Dao fragment and survived the pain of Dao Accumulation. This person ranked first, indeed! "

" !     !"


"Hey, our Martial Artist of Vast Cloud Heavenly Palace doesn't seem to be outstanding! Until now, none of the top 10,000 people have entered! That Ai Anxin is still ranked at 110,000 I did not expect Xue Muyang's performance, better than her, actually entered the top 80,000! "

" , ! , !   !"


"Anxious, this is just the beginning, is Luo Zheng not showing up?"

"Don't say Luo Zheng, that brat hasn't seen the shadow yet!"

"Found Luo Zheng! Three hundred and ninety-three thousand people! He has already rushed into the top five million! "A Martial Artist from Vast Cloud Heavenly Palace shouted.

" ! ! !" 


Yun Luo, who has been silent for a while, heard the voice of the Martial Artist and his eyes suddenly lit up.

   


Since the opening of Dream Battlefield, Luo Zheng has completely disappeared, and Yun Luo even suspected that Luo Zheng did not enter Dream Battlefield! Now, the first time I heard the name of Luo Zheng's, Yun Luo was relieved.

   ! , 


She trusts Luo Zheng, and the fellow is either not involved, but as long as he enters Dream Battlefield, he is bound to win a good result!

   , !


"Only 3.9 million people What is this fellow doing? "Some people are dissatisfied with a mutter, no matter what, this brat's performance is completely inconsistent with his style in Xin Huo Inheritance!

" ?"   !

Apotheosis Chapter 1197 - Comrade Mao

Many people are also secretly screaming.   

 


In any case This Luo Zheng is from Vast Cloud Heavenly Palace 

If other Martial Artists are gone, the top five million Martial Artists are also excellent in the universe.

   


However, Luo Zheng has created so many terrifying records. So far, the sword that Luo Zheng left in Sword Trial Hall has firmly occupied the top position, almost all the Martial entering Sword Trial Hall. Artist!

     !


Such a fellow, actually ranked at 3.9 million, really made them a little disappointed.

   


This ranking is better than not seeing it.

Dream space exists in the universe, almost every Holy Land has it, and Luo Zheng is famous for the killing of Heavenly Venerate, and the use of Roaring Order to tell stories from time to time. Naturally, there are many good people looking for Luo Zheng's. first name.

     


When Luo Zheng entered the top five million, there were also many unrelated people who discovered his existence.

 , 


"Cut, Luo Zheng, this is not the case with Brat. Dream Battlefield has been open for so long, and it is only ranked in more than three million "

"   , "


"I have already said that this Luo Zheng is just a bullshit luck, got the strange Immortal Mansion, its strength is not worth mentioning! How to compete with the supreme talent in 100,000 Great World? "

"   , ! ?"


"If you don't have the strength, don't go into Dream Battlefield!"

"I heard that Luo Zheng is now trapped in the Immortal Mansion, killing four Heavenly Venerate It is already a death sin, perhaps, he also wants to seek a breakthrough! "

"   , !"


" "

There are countless lifeforms in the universe. The number of Luo Zheng's people from the five million names is not many, but the absolute number is still quite large. Soon, the rankings about Luo Zheng are also rapidly spread in the universe 

     


In general, the most eye-catching is the top 100 Martial Artist, and Luo Zheng is a special case.

   


Luo Zheng is still floating outside the Main City.

After killing Long Qin, the Martial Artists in Main City were shocked.

Long Qin's strength is obvious to all. Most of the Martial Artists here have not taken Long Qin's strength. The human Martial Artist seems to be a monster, killing Long Qin three times in a row.

   , 


After Luo Zheng showed unfathomable strength, the dream points of these powerhouses in the city were also painstakingly accumulated. Who would like to offer them easily?

   , ?


It's not that there is no Martial Artist to challenge Luo Zheng, but the challenge of Luo Zheng's Demon Race Martial Artist is not a dream points of the fellow, the strength is low, take action to kill it is meaningless 

     


In desperation, Luo Zheng once again wandered around the Main City!

However, the battle between Luo Zheng and Long Qin was too great. He flew around the city wall, and the Martial Artist inside followed the Luo Zheng on the wall.

   


Not that they are good, watching the battle between powerhouses is very useful to them, they are not willing to miss this opportunity.

   


In this way, every time Luo Zheng walked through, the wall was immediately followed by a black Demon Race Martial Artist.

   


So conspicuous, who will be stupid to stay outside the city?

Some Martial Artists who had been fighting in the city outside the city, found the vast movement on the wall. When they saw Luo Zheng alone, they went straight to see such a big posture, where would they kill? One by one is also immediately retracted into the Main City.

     ? 


This scene is to let Luo Zheng can not help but smile.

It's just the rules of Dream Battlefield, and the complaints are useless, not to mention that Luo Zheng has no habit of complaining.

   


After Luo Zheng turned around the Main City for two rounds, he never had a dream point, and he finally had to give up.

   


Anyway, this time back to Main City, he has already got more than 300,000 dream points!

 , !


At this time, Luo Zheng remembered the cave, the cave that paid 300,000 dream points to enter 

 , 


After all, staying in this Main City doesn't make much sense. Even if you turn a few more laps and encounter a few unopened Martial Artists, you won't get too many Dream points. It's better to explore the cave first.

     


The rules of Dream Battlefield are unreasonable, perhaps related to those in the wild.

   


After all, the entire Dream Battlefield is to evict the most powerhouse in Divine Sea Realm. If everyone is in the Main City, then the powerful powerhouse may not be able to do anything.

   


Thinking of this, Luo Zheng did not hesitate any more, and after glanced at the many Martial Artists on the wall, he flew away again in the wild 

   , 


Above the wall, six Demon Race Martial Artists stand in the corner, and their eyes are on the direction of Luo Zheng's departure.

   


"This Human Race Martial Artist has left alone. Do you want to keep up?"

"The six of us have joined forces and should be able to kill him. There are many dream points on him "

"   "


"It is an opportunity."

These six Demon Race Martial Artists, everyone's origins are extraordinary, perhaps a little worse than Long Qin, but also not far from each other.

   , 


In the case of one person, no one dares to say that he has the confidence to defeat Luo Zheng, but the dream points that Luo Zheng has are indeed very attractive, so it is unwilling to let Luo Zheng let go of their hearts, so these six talents intend to join hands.

     


Now that Luo Zheng is leaving alone, their minds are warming up. If you want to pursue Luo Zheng, it is a tough choice for these six people.

   , 


Seeing that Luo Zheng's figure slowly disappeared, one of the Demon Race Martial Artists shook his head. "It's still about about it. The real strength of this fellow should not show half!"

  "   !"


Just showing the strength, it has already made people very jealous. No one knows what Luo Zheng's means and trump card are, so Luo Zheng's dream points, although many, but the six people chose to be safe. give up 

     , 


Before Luo Zheng left, she deliberately slowed down her speed.

He knows that some Martial Artists are greedy and may join forces to chase themselves, and he is waiting for these fellows.

   


However, this time, Luo Zheng was somewhat disappointed, but behind him was not followed by one person 

   


"It's still too greedy."

He killed Long Qin three times in a row, and it was a bit overdone.

However, after thinking about it, even if he killed Long Qin once, the effect would not be much worse. It is estimated that he still couldn't catch a few fat sheep.

   , 


Since no one is chasing himself, Luo Zheng is also speeding up his journey and heading for the wilderness.

   


After half an hour, Luo Zheng has leapt tens of thousands of miles and finally found the cave! Standing in the wilderness, I looked at Luo Zheng's brows slightly, and there were three Heaven Splitting Rats around the cave.

   !   


After the killing of this Heaven Splitting Rat, it seems that after some time, it will also be "reborn" again.

   " " 


"There are many rewards for killing this Heaven Splitting Rat. One is a thousand dream points. Every time you kill it after you are born again, you can get three thousand dream points If the strength is good, you can repeatedly kill Heaven Splitting Rat here," Luo Zheng thought in his heart.

"     ," 


This seems to be safe, but the Heaven Splitting Rat is quite tricky for many Divine Sea Realm Martial Artists, and it's far less natural than killing Martial Artist in the city.

   , 


For Luo Zheng, this method of accumulating Dream points is a bit too stupid and not too fast.

   


"Before you enter this cave, let's talk about it. Since this Dream Battlefield arranges these things, there must be something crucial!"

"   !"


Thinking of this, Luo Zheng did not hesitate any more, the figure flashed and went straight to the three Heaven Splitting Rats 

   , 


With the previous experience, it has become very simple to deal with this Heaven Splitting Rat.

Using the Eight Tunes Flying Smoke and the Thunder Tribulation Kill, the three Heaven Splitting Rats were lured into it, and the Heavenly Tribulation was again brought to life.

   


With three thousand dream points breaking into Luo Zheng's within the body, this time Luo Zheng went straight to the cave.

 , 


When Luo Zheng was just approaching the cave, the optical rotation stopped Luo Zheng's way, and a thought appeared in Luo Zheng's mind.

   


"Into the evil wind tunnel, you need 300,000 dream points "

At the moment of hearing the sentence, Luo Zheng nodded faintly, staring at the dark cave, and then he said: "Yes!"

   , :" !"


Whoosh-

Then there was a strange attraction in this cave. Luo Zheng within the body, the yellow dream light points, was pulled out of the body by this attraction, and then it was not in the light!

   , !


In a flash, Luo Zheng lost 300,000 Dream points 

This hard-working dream points was instantly deducted, and Luo Zheng was a little distressed.

   


Apotheosis Bab 1198

Ketika Luo Zheng dalam poin mimpi tubuh dikurangi, peringkatnya mulai jatuh liar.   

 , 


Nama-nama di piramida naik dan turun. Itu juga normal, peringkat dari Artis Bela Diri mega, atau banyak titik mimpi, dan satu titik mimpi akan bervariasi oleh puluhan ribu tempat.

     


Dalam kasus Artis Bela Diri umum, penurunan peringkat tiba-tiba mungkin tidak menarik perhatian orang.

 , 


Tapi Artis Bela Diri papan atas, pasang surut, semua orang menyimpulkan kemenangan antara Artis Bela Diri berdasarkan peringkat ini!

   !


Sebagai contoh, Xuanyuan Chenfeng, yang menduduki peringkat pertama, tiba-tiba jatuh dari puncak piramida dan jatuh ke lebih dari 40.000 ...

   , 


Seniman Bela Diri di alam semesta berspekulasi bahwa Xuanyuan Chenfeng seharusnya terbunuh sekali!

 , !


Membunuh setengah dari poin mimpi, Xuanyuan Chenfeng masih bisa bertahan di 40.000. Saya bisa membayangkan bahwa poin mimpi yang dia kumpulkan sebelumnya tidak terbayangkan.

   


Tapi siapa yang terbunuh oleh Xuanyuan Chenfeng?

Siapa yang bisa membunuh Anak Dao di Dewa Tak Berpikir?

Orang-orang di luar bodoh ...

Peringkat Luo Zheng tidak tinggi, tetapi masih banyak Artis Bela Diri yang memperhatikannya.

 , 


Saat ini, nama Luo Zheng tiba-tiba menghilang! Banyak kekhawatiran asli tentang Artis Bela Diri Luo Zheng juga sangat diragukan. Bisakah Luo Zheng ini bahkan tidak mempertahankan posisi 3,9 juta?

 !   ?


Mata Yun Luo juga menunjukkan jejak kesalahan, apakah Luo Zheng juga dibunuh oleh orang-orang?

 , ?


Dia mengikuti peringkat ini dan mulai melihat ke bawah!

Luo Zheng terbunuh sekali, dan poin mimpi hilang setengah. Dia bisa menyimpulkan berapa banyak nama Luo Zheng jatuh!

   !


Tetapi dia menyuntikkan persepsi ke dalam piramida dan mencari ke bawah peringkat. Dia menemukan 12 juta orang dan tidak dapat menemukan nama Luo Zheng!

   , !


Dia bahkan lebih bingung.

Bahkan jika itu terbunuh sekali, tidak mungkin jatuh ke lebih dari 10 juta orang dalam waktu singkat! Mungkinkah Luo Zheng dibunuh dua kali dalam waktu singkat?

 , ! , ?


Killing once, it takes a while to resurrect, and Luo Zheng is unlikely to be killed twice Yun Luo is also puzzling.

   


Yun Luo doesn't have much anxiety. This Luo Zheng has always been like this. In the case of Xin Huo Inheritance, Luo Zheng's ranking is extremely backward. Soon after, it has not quickly caught up. She just can't figure it out!

     ? !


Among the Dream Battlefield 

There are only over 10,000 dream points left in Luo Zheng.

Earning 10,000 dream points in this Dream Battlefield is not that difficult.

Luo Zheng also deliberately inquired about his ranking. In this world, he fell directly to more than 40 million people And the ranking in the entire Dream Battlefield is 2 billion!

   , !


"But it," Luo Zheng shook his head.

Anyway, 300,000 Dream points have been taken away, and I hope to explore this cave to receive a return!

 , !


When those optical lights absorbed the dream light points, they gradually turned into a six-winged worm, which was completely condensed by the yellow rays of light, floating quietly around Luo Zheng.

   , 


When the six-winged light worm appeared, the resistance applied to Luo Zheng disappeared quietly.

 , 


After losing the resistance, Luo Zheng took the pace and got into the cave 

   


The cave in front of it is not large, and it is only about one foot wide. This road is a narrow downhill road.

   , 


Above this path, there is a white rotation at every 100 feet.

When Luo Zheng saw the first rotation, Luo Zheng's heart suddenly sinks. Doesn't it take 300,000 dream points every time it clears an optical rotation? If so, I am afraid that he will not be able to make up so many dream points.

   ? , 


Luo Zheng's worries did not happen. Whenever he approached those optical rotations, he did encounter a force majeure resistance, but the six-winged light-worm, accompanied by Luo Zheng, flew to the white light. The white light is directly absorbed, and the resistance is once again disappeared.

       


"You need this little insect to get into the depths of this cave all the way "Luo Zheng noticed the faint sinking of the six-winged light worm.

" , " , 


The circular rotation of the road was absorbed by the six-winged light insect, and Luo Zheng continued to follow the only path in the cave!

 , !


100 feet 

1,000 feet (333 m) 

Soon after, Luo Zheng came to the depths of the cave.

And in the depths of this cave, there is an ancient temple 

Although it is deep in the ground and the old temple looks extremely broken, there is a hidden power in it.

   


"How can there be an ancient temple at the bottom of this place?"Luo Zheng's face is full of doubts.

" ?" 


According to Luo Zheng, this Dream Battlefield should have been the Great World that existed, belonging to the closed Great World.

   


In normal times, the Dream Battlefield formed by fifty Great Worlds is not allowed to enter. Only after Dream Battlefield is opened, the outside Martial Artist can enter the spot through the Heavenly Dao and is limited to Divine Sea. Realm.

     


This Dream Battlefield has been lived before?

Look at the three Heaven Splitting Rats outside the cave, plus the light in the cave, and the six-winged light insects around them. Such caves are obviously artificially arranged, but who is it?

     ?


Luo Zheng flies Upper Realm, the time is short, and the travel is not rich.

He already knows that among the Human Race Three Great Influences, there is only Buddhism in the Myriad Buddha Saint Domain!

 , !


It is said that the 10th Grade Holy Land of Myriad Buddha Saint Domain is not named after "Holy Land", but is named directly by the name of "Blessed Land" or "Temple" 

 , " " , " " " " 


Is this ancient temple associated with Myriad Buddha Saint Domain?

Without too much hesitation, Luo Zheng entered this ancient temple.

Just when Luo Zheng just stepped into this ancient temple, he saw a Buddha statue!

It was a smiling Maitreya Buddha. The strange thing is that this statue is riding on a high horse. This Maitreya Buddha has a round face and a round eye. From a single point of view, it seems to be staring at Luo Zheng.

     


I don't know why, although it is known that this Maitreya Buddha is a dead thing, but Luo Zheng has a feeling of being snooped.

   


This feeling is very bad, after all, the atmosphere here is really weird.

If you change a place, if you don't know if there is any heavy treasure, Luo Zheng may choose to leave this ancient temple. After all, the atmosphere of this ancient temple is too strange. It seems that it is not a blessed land but a fierce land!

     !


But now Luo Zheng is in Dream Battlefield after all. After his death, he is only resurrected in the Main City. Not only has he paid the "transit fee" of 300,000 dream points, but Luo Zheng naturally refuses to withdraw easily. 100,000 dream points, what can bring back to yourself.

   " "  , 


So Luo Zheng took a straight step and bypassed the statue of Maitreya Buddha, leaving the vestibule of the ancient temple and entering the real inner courtyard of the ancient temple.

   , 


However, after Luo Zheng entered the inner court, the smiling expression of Maitreya Buddha began to change, but the eyes turned upside down, and the smiling mouth also turned over!

   , !


After the flip, the Maitreya Buddha at the moment is already full of fierceness.

Luo Zheng, who has already entered the inner court, can't see this scene naturally 

"boom!"

He had just stepped into the inner court and had no time to look at the environment of the inner courtyard. The two doors behind him were suddenly closed!

   !


Luo Zheng turned and glanced at the broken wooden door and didn't choose to crush it 

 , 


If the ancient temple can really trap itself, the wooden door will be broken and you will not be able to crush it. If Luo Zheng can easily break the escape, then the trouble he will face is not worth mentioning.

     


Around the empty courtyard of the inner courtyard, there are four Buddha statues erected!

The four Buddha statues were held by the long staff, and the four long staff members were pointed at the center of the inner court, which is the position of Luo Zheng.

   , 


This is Arhat ? "Luo Zheng's stared at the statue and said.

Just as Luo Zheng looked at the four Buddha statues, a "crackling" sound came from the ear!

 , " " !


In almost a blink of an eye, Luo Zheng has discovered the source of this "crackling" sound 

 , " " 


The surface of the four Buddha statues in the corner began to crack a crack, and the Arhat Buddha Statue started to move!

 , !


In a short while, the stone statues carved out of these four stones were jumped down the lotus flower base, waving the long staff, and then went straight to Luo Zheng.

     


Although it is the body of stone, but the movements of watching them are extremely flexible, as if daoist 

   


Apotheosis Bab 1199

Keempat Patung Buddha Arhat ini memiliki tongkat panjang, atau titik, atau tusukan, atau dipukuli, atau disapu, pasangan sempurna di antara patung-patung Buddha!   

     , !


Kecepatan mereka tidak cepat, kekuatannya tidak mengejutkan, tetapi Luo Zheng tersapu, tetapi hampir tidak ada kekurangan, sebatang bayangan hampir semua jalan keluar Luo Zheng!

     !


"Stick Art yang bagus dan lembut!"

Namun, tidak ada cacat, dan itu tidak berarti bahwa Luo Zheng tidak dapat mematahkan empat Seni Tongkat Patung Buddha Arhat.

 , 


Dia mengambil langkah secara acak, dan sosok itu menghilang secara aneh di tempat itu, muncul di belakang salah satu Patung Buddha Arhat!

   !


"Hu hu hu !"

Bahkan jika Luo Zheng menembus ruang, ada tiga batang bayangan yang mengikuti!

Di hadapan ketiga batang ini, ekspresi Luo Zheng tenang, dan tangan kanan dicetak seperti kilat pada Patung Buddha Arhat!

   !


"Hei "

Dengan suara puing-puing pecah, Patung Buddha Arhat hancur.

Pada saat patung Arhat Buddha hancur, tubuh Luo Zheng seperti ikan yang melompat keluar dari air. Sword Step menghindari ketiga tongkat dan kemudian menembus ruang itu lagi, muncul di belakang Arhat Buddha Statue lainnya.

     


Dicetak di telapak tangan Anda.

"kuang dang "

Seni Tongkat dari keempat patung Buddha ini adalah singular dan mulus.

Tetapi bagaimanapun juga, hanya ada empat patung Buddha batu. Itu belum tentu menjadi penyebab kerusakan yang disebabkan oleh bayangan tubuh kedagingan Luo Zheng.

   


"kuang dang!"

"kuang dang!"

Setelah beberapa saat, keempat Patung Buddha Arhat semuanya dihancurkan di bawah telapak tangan Luo Zheng.

 , 


Ketika Luo Zheng menghancurkan patung-patung ini, matanya jatuh ke pintu halaman dalam. Pada saat menghancurkan, pintu halaman dalam tidak berangin.

   , 


"Di halaman dalam, ada juga lapangan dalam?"

Wajah Luo Zheng penuh keraguan. Dia juga mengamati sebelum memasuki kuil kuno ini. Kuil kuno ini tidak besar, tetapi halaman bagian dalam ditutupi dengan halaman bagian dalam, jelas melampaui ukuran yang diperkirakan oleh Luo Zheng.

     


Doubt doubts, Luo Zheng did not have much hesitation, it is once again into this inner courtyard!

   !


After entering the second inner courtyard, Luo Zheng looked down and found four more Buddha statues.

   


"Or four Arhat Buddha Statues "

These four Arhats are slightly different from the previous four!

The four Arhat Buddha Statues in the first courtyard are Doorman Arhat, with serious eyes, alert gaze, and a brave demon.

     


The Arhat Buddha Statue in this second courtyard is clarified by Yuyu. They celebrated each other with a burst of joy. Luo Zheng looked at the past and was even infected by the momentum of the four Buddha statues. It's a lot easier.

       


"Joyous Arhat "

There are many types of Arhat. Although Luo Zheng has never been to Myriad Buddha Saint Domain, it is known in Buddhist books that this Arhat is divided into eighteen Arhats.

   , 


Like this, Joyous Arhat, also known as Kanakavatsa Venerable 

If so, is there not more than 18 in the inner court?

Thought of this, the four Joyous Arhat's surface cracked open, the four Joyous Arhat jumped down the lotus flower base, long sleeves fluttering, with a smile of flowers, went straight to Luo Zheng!

     , !


"sou sou sou sou "

The four Joyous Arhats are the fingering, and the Daoguang is fierce, as if it can penetrate all things, pointing to Luo Zheng!

   , !


Thinking of the following 16 inner courts, Luo Zheng didn't hesitate any more. He didn't want to waste too much time here, simply relying on the powerful fleshly body.

   , 


But even if it is hard-resistance, Luo Zheng will change the pace before the finger light reaches his fleshly body, avoiding the key points of his own.

   , 


"break for me !"

After the four Joyous Arhats approached, Luo Zheng's had a palm.

With the palm of the hand whistling away, the sound of rubble and shattering came out, and the four Buddha statues of Joyous Arhat also shattered.

   


After smashing the four Joyous Arhats, Luo Zheng continued to move forward. When he reached the door of the second inner court, the door just opened.

   , 


Breaking into it, it really came to the third inner court, and in this third inner court, there are still four Buddha statues!

   , !


"Deer Sitting Arhat !"

On the base of the lotus flower, there are four life-like stone deer on it, and on the stone deer there are four Arhat Buddha Statues that are self-confident and self-respecting. At first glance, they give a very noble meaning. .

     


Soon, the four Deer Sitting Arhat rode the stone deer, and also went straight to Luo Zheng 

   


The fourth inner court, arrogant Arhat 

The fifth inner court, Tota Arhat 

The sixth inner court, Meditating Arhat 

These Arhat's respective cultivation techniques are different from the offensive methods. For example, the Meditating Arhat will not attack at all.

 , 


They just sat in the same place and did not attack Luo Zheng.

However, Luo Zheng did not crush the four Arhats, but could not enter the next inner court. He could only go straight to the four corners of the inner court and smash them one by one.

   , 


But this Meditating Arhat sits still in the same place, but there is a mysterious Buddha light, covered with the main body, this defense power is also amazingly powerful, it is not easy to break it, it is also Luo Zheng is infinite, for other Martial Artist has entered this place, fearing that it will take more effort.

       , 


The seventh inner court, Overseas Arhat 

The eighth inner court, Elephant Riding Arhat 

 

 

As Luo Zheng guessed, there are indeed as many as eighteen inner courts.

Starting from Doorman Arhat in the first inner court, the more Arhat's strength is, the more aggressive the attack is. The Luo Zheng can't help but sigh the vastness of the Buddha. It's no wonder that Myriad Buddha Saint Domain is a holy land. , can stand up a Human Race Great Influences alone!

       !


Seventeenth inner courtyard , Taming Tiger Arhat ! Also known as Pindola!

When I got here, even Luo Zheng felt the pressure!

Although the Taming Tiger Arhat is still a stone statue, the power of the four statues is no longer comparable to the previous Arhat.

   


Every step of the four Arhats, the sound of the Tigers, whether it is speed or strength, is comparable to the strength of the Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist!

   , !


"Roar "

In the face of four Taming Tiger Arhats, Luo Zheng's expression is solemn, Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword is already in the hands!

   !


He has a feeling of crisis. These statues are made of strange stones, and they are very fragile, but the exquisite craftsmanship is far better than those of Divine Sea Realm Martial Artist.

   , 


At this moment, Luo Zheng really felt that he was surrounded by this Taming Tiger Arhat, and it was difficult to struggle.

   


Although the previous 16 inner courts, Luo Zheng passed smoothly, but the smooth progress does not mean that it will go smoothly. There are many examples of the failure of the door. Luo Zheng will never be the key because of the previous smooth. When you are relaxed, be vigilant.

     , 


"sou sou sou sou "

Dozens of Nether God Shadows spurt from this Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword.

But the four Taming Tiger Arhat's palms are fierce and hot, and the speed is extremely fast. Although the number of Nether God Shadows is large, they are not close to the four Arhat statues, and they are beaten and beaten by a mysterious palm print.

     


Again.

Luo Zheng's eyes flashed a glimmer of light!

Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword was pushed to the extreme by Luo Zheng. In addition to Nether God Shadow, the wind blade is like a blossoming lotus flower. The wind blade is the petals that drift with the wind, but this "Flower petals" with extremely powerful destructive power!

     " " !


In addition to the wind blade, there is also a road of lightning, which is lighter than the wind blade, but it is followed by the four Taming Tiger Arhat!

     !


"crackling! Brushing "

In this inner courtyard, all kinds of energy are constantly coming out, but Luo Zheng in the center is like the center of the typhoon. The expression is calm, and even the sleeves have not been rolled up!

     , !


The four Taming Tiger Arhats brought the two-handed palms to the extreme. Each of the Taming Tiger Arhat's palms was violently waved, and a palm print was thrown out, and a virtual tiger's phantom was saved. It is three or four hundred paw prints. The four Taming Tiger Arhats are at the same time, as if thousands of tigers roar around Luo Zheng!

       , !


It is also the illusion of this tiger, which offsets the power of Luo Zheng's long sword, and the two sides are deadlocked!

   !


It is now, in the depths of this ancient temple, a tall golden Buddha suddenly opened his eyes!

   !


This golden Buddha has a sword in one hand and a lotus flower in one hand. His face is not angry and self-defeating. This feels Luo Zheng's sword, but his eyes are still indifferent 

     


"This Yan Era, there is another little brat that repairs Severing Emotions Divine Dao This Severing Emotions Divine Dao has banned hundreds of Yan Era. Why did this Yan Era appear in succession? "

"   , ?"


=============================

===========================


=============================

===========================


Apotheosis Bab 1200

Buddha agung ini sedang dalam meditasi mendalam.   

 , 


Bahkan, Luo Zheng saat ini tidak menampilkan Divine Go-Sword.

 , 


Setelah bertahun-tahun marah, Divine Go-Sword lebih halus dan murni. Di jantung Luo Zheng, emosi yang terputus ini menjadi semakin jelas!

   , !


Tapi dia tidak bisa melakukan semuanya dengan sepenuhnya memotong semua emosinya, jadi Divine Go-Sword tidak pernah sempurna.

   , 


Namun, setelah beberapa tahun curah hujan, bahkan jika Divine Go-Sword belum digunakan, ada sedikit emosi yang terputus dalam gerakan pedang ini, dan Buddha besar menangkap makna dari emosi yang terputus ini, baru saja saya perhatikan bahwa Luo Zheng sedang berjalan Emosi Severing Divine Dao.

     


Jejak Qi Primal Chaos diekstraksi dari Laut Chaos Primordial Luo Zheng!

Qi Primal Chaos ini berubah menjadi bilah angin petir, yang tersebar di sekitar, dan juga dicampur dengan Nether God Shadow!

   !


Setelah menghancurkan sekitar empat atau lima napas dengan empat Arhat Tiger Taming, mata mata itu berkedip dan langsung menuju ke salah satu Arhat Tiger Taming.

   


Meskipun keempat Taming Tiger Arhat dapat menyerahkan pedang petir dan angin di Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword, mereka telah mencapai batasnya. Dengan cara ini, harimau membanting telapak tangan dan membanting tindakan. Gerakannya sangat indah, tetapi pada akhirnya itu masih terungkap. Keluar dari kekurangan.

     


Dan Luo Zheng telah dengan tajam menangkap kelemahan ini, yang harus ditipu!

Seberapa cepat kecepatannya?

Ketika Arhat Taming Tiger ini menemukan Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng telah menempel di dadanya, dan telapak tangannya telah diletakkan di lengan Arhat ini!

   !


"rusak!"

A "broken" word spit out softly, accompanied by the sound of "kuang dang", a neat palm print appeared on the burly chest of Taming Tiger Arhat, and the crack around the palm print was spread rapidly, covering the entire Arhat The body, then the stone statue collapsed into a pile of rubble.

 " " , " "     , 


At this moment, Luo Zheng was the first to arrive, and the prestige of the wind blade was dissipated, and the rubble was blown away.

   


Crushed the statue in front of him, Luo Zheng did not stop, the figure was gently swayed, the long sword hanging down suddenly provoked, rolled up a refreshing sword light in the air, and went straight to another Taming on the side. Tiger Arhat is gone!

     , !


"boom!"

The sword light instantly drowns the Taming Tiger Statue!

The Taming Tiger Statue is making a slap in the face of Luo Zheng, but at this moment it suddenly stops. When Luo Zheng goes straight to the next Taming Tiger Statue, there is a thin line on the statue. The inaudible crack, then the crack is split, and the split slit is very smooth 

     , 


"Hey, hey "

The remaining two Taming Tiger Statues have not formed a siege, and there is no threat to Luo Zheng. It is not too difficult for Luo Zheng to crush it.

   


After breaking the four statues, Luo Zheng still did not stop.

This is already the seventeenth inner courtyard 

It has been a lot of time and effort, although it is not particularly dangerous.

   


But Luo Zheng is more expecting in his heart. After the test of this cave, what rewards are there? Next, it should be the last inner court, that is, the eighteenth inner court 

   ?   


When Luo Zheng just stepped into the last inner court, the ear suddenly passed a sound of dragons and whistles.

 , 


"Taming Dragon Arhat !"

Luo Zheng's fine mans in the double eyes flashed slightly.

Four of Arhat's four corners of the inner court are wrapped around a True Dragon!

 , !


In ancient times, the dragon descended, and with great power, surrendered True Dragon to the Buddha This Taming Dragon Arhat is also known as Venerable Jiaye.

   


This time, Luo Zheng did not choose to wait in the same place!

He swayed the seventeenth inner courtyard, killing the Buddha statues of the seventeen Arhats, and knowing the joints.

   


These Arhat Buddha Statues are not powerful in their own right. After all, these Arhats are not the main body, but the Buddha statues are dyed with a touch of Buddha's heart.

   , 


Incense, which is the Strength of Faith.

Among the Myriad Buddha Saint Domain, the infinite believers offer, although different, but in essence the same as the three kings of Monster Night Race!

   , !


But the gap is still there 

The Monster Night Race was born in the universe, and the use and development of the Strength of Faith is limited to the three kings.

   


However, the legacy of Myriad Buddha Saint Domain is far from simple.

The so-called All Heaven Gods and Buddhas, this "Zhu" word, has a meaning of "multi", more than one day, then the gods and Buddhas juxtaposed, obviously not only in this round of Heavenly Dao, This Buddha is a presence alongside True God!

 , " " , " "     , !


In other words, the legacy of this Myriad Buddha Saint Domain is probably beyond the existence of Heavenly Dao.

   


If this Eighteen Arhats is coming, I am afraid that with a single finger, the current Luo Zheng can be easily killed 

   


Now these stone statues, with the power of a scent of incense, can exert such strength, and Luo Zheng has been very taboo. The most important thing is that the four Arhats teamed up, and the strength will increase several times, with almost no flaws.

       


The strength of the last four statues in the inner court is far stronger than before. To be on the safe side, Luo Zheng went straight into one of the statues after entering the inner courtyard.

     


Breaking the statue of a Taming Dragon Arhat, the next thing is much better.

 , 


The surface of the Taming Dragon Arhat in this corner is constantly chapped, and under the tremor of the body, it will be active.

   


However, Luo Zheng is already close to the Taming Dragon Arhat. One finger points to the head of the Taming Dragon Arhat. As long as the fingertips touch, the power rushes, and the statue made of this stone can be turned into a powder.

     


That giant stone can not stop the power of Luo Zheng, and under this finger, it can also be crushed, let alone the eight-foot stone statue in front of you?

   , ?


Although the Taming Dragon Arhat main body has not been moved, the True Dragon stone carving on his body crawls from his right shoulder and explores the corner of the True Dragon, pointing to the finger of Luo Zheng. Hit it out!

     !


True Dragon, but it's made of stone!

Luo Zheng didn't hesitate. This means that he is bound to get it. If you break a statue, you can kill the other three. This cave is rewarded. It is something you must get.

     , 


Wan didn't think that when Luo Zheng's fingertips were above the True Dragon's horns, he felt a huge force to pass 

   


"boom!"

The fingertips of the fingers collide with the corners!

The corners are shattered, but Luo Zheng is also blocked back!

At the same time, Taming Dragon Arhat was completely "awake", and the two palms were under each other, and there was a sound of dragons, as if a True Dragon was awakened in his within the body.

 , " "  , 


At the same time, the True Dragon statue wrapped around his shoulders began to flash a little blue luster of gems of rays of light!

   !


That is the light of the dragon scales!

"Roar-"

The two palms are shot at the same time, but they are printed on the chest of Luo Zheng's!

Luo Zheng under the sneak attack, a blow failed to succeed, can not be prevented, even by this Taming Dragon Arhat!

   , !


"Good power!"

Under the two palms, Luo Zheng felt the power of a sea of mountains.

 , 


The whole person turned back toward the rear, his feet plowed a groove on the ground, and the whole person slammed into the wall on the other side of the inner court!

   !


"Boom!"

Luo Zheng is smashed with such a powerful force, how amazing is the destructive power?

 , ?


If placed in the Lower Realm, a mountain is hit by him. Not only will the first mountain collapse, but even a series of mountains will be broken.

   , 


The walls of the inner court looked rotten and ruined. It seemed that a gust of wind was blowing, and the broken temple could be destroyed. But the wall bears the Luo Zheng collision, and it doesn't move. The firmness makes people feel amazed 

     , 


But this is, after all, Dream Battlefield.

The walls of the Main City outside are also very common, but the powerful Martial Artist can't smash the wall. I think the two have a truth. What is the structure of Heavenly Dao, is it so easy to be destroyed?

     , ?


Luo Zheng also has no intention to think about this. His current attention is on the shoulder of this Taming Dragon Arhat on the True Dragon!

   !


He is very powerful, and he also relies on the power of True Dragon, so he absolutely did not expect that Taming Dragon Arhat seems to be able to use the power of the True Dragon on his shoulders.

   , 


Seolah Taming Dragon Arhat tertembak, sisik naga pada patung True Dragon juga menyala, dan kilau cahaya biru permata juga melintas ...

   


Namun, Naga Sejati ini, bagaimanapun juga, hanyalah patung batu. Bahkan jika skala seluruh tubuh cerah, kekuatannya menakutkan, tapi itu bukan poin yang tidak mampu Luo Zheng!

     !


Jika itu adalah naga asli, setelah seluruh sisik tubuh menyala, saya khawatir Luo Zheng telah difoto sebagai abu terbang.

   


Apotheosis Bab 1201

Meski begitu, Luo Zheng tidak berani melihat ke bawah pada keempat Taming Dragon Arhat.   

 , 


Baru saja Kekuatan sisik naga telah mencapai tingkat yang sangat mengerikan. Secara umum, Realm Martial Artist Divine Sea ditembak oleh telapak tangan ini, saya khawatir itu akan hancur berantakan!

       , !


Luo Zheng, yang bersandar di dinding, juga memiliki hati yang penuh kemenangan!

 !


Hal yang sama adalah Strength of Dragon Scales, tetapi dia ingin melihat siapa yang lebih kuat!

   !


Naga Menjinakkan ini Arhat memanggul Naga Sejati, aku khawatir itu juga sumber yang bagus. Sayangnya, dia ada di Dream Battlefield. Meskipun dia bisa menggunakan Kekuatan Timbangan Naga, Azure Dragon Soul belum pernah diproyeksikan. Dia tidak bisa berkomunikasi dengan Azure Dragon. Dengan cara yang sama, Luo Zheng dapat menggunakan Roh Pedang, tetapi tidak bisa berkomunikasi dengan Xun. Jika Pedang Roh dipanggil, tidak ada Jiwa Xun.

           


Memikirkan hal ini, Luo Zheng tidak ragu, Naga Taming terbaru Arhat telah datang langsung ke dirinya sendiri, hanya untuk melihat Naga Taming ini tangan Arhat terbanting, Naga Sejati di pundak mulai berkedip hijau dan sinar cahaya yang bersinar Melihat Kekuatan Timbangan Naga mengalir ke patung ini!

     , !


Luo Zheng dengan kedua tangan dan tangan, Kekuatan Timbangan Naga juga mengalir ke dalam tubuhnya, tanpa mundur sedikit pun, tetapi juga kedua telapak tangan.

   , 


"Mengaum!"

Sebaliknya, telapak tangan Taming Dragon Arhat disertai dengan suara naga, dan pahatan batu True Dragon di bahu juga meraung, dan kekuatannya bahkan lebih baik.

   , 


Sekejap mata, empat telapak tangan saling berpotongan!

"Ledakan!"

Dengan suara keras, tubuh Luo Zheng mundur mundur!

Luo Zheng dalam proses terbang mundur, tetapi juga merasakan darah bergulir, sangat tidak nyaman, kekuatan Arhat Taming Naga ini tidak bisa diremehkan!

   , !


Namun, Luo Zheng tertembak, dan hal yang sama berlaku untuk Taming Dragon Arhat.

In the case of the previous Arhat Buddha Statue, under the hands of Luo Zheng, I am afraid that I have been photographed as a powder.

   


But the Taming Dragon Arhat is far more numerous than the previous ones, and Luo Zheng can understand it. After all, the Taming Dragon Arhat main body is going to bear the Strength of Dragon Scales of the True Dragon statue, if this body is not built. Sturdy, his power has not been beaten, I am afraid that it will collapse and collapse.

     , 


Just like Luo Zheng's previous fleshly body, the Strength of Dragon Scales is capped. If the Strength of Dragon Scales is forced to introduce itself, the fleshly body will disintegrate first.

   , 


"Boom!"

"Boom!"

Two loud noises echoed in the inner courtyard.

It was the sound of Luo Zheng and the Taming Dragon Arhat flying down the wall of the inner court.

 , 


The Taming Dragon Arhat hit the wall of the inner courtyard. Under the huge impact force, there was a big crack on the surface of the body. It seemed that it could not bear the impact and it would collapse!

     !


But in the crack, but a golden Buddha light was scattered, and then the cracks were seen to be repaired at a speed that was visible. In a moment, the cracks were close together, and the golden Buddha light disappeared naturally 

     , 


This time, under the impact of Luo Zheng, it was also hit by the seven-seven-six-six-six-skinned, slightly sweet and sore throat, and a blood could not help but spray it out.

   , 


"Can you heal?"

Seeing the reaction of Taming Dragon Arhat opposite, Luo Zheng's brow couldn't help but wrinkle. He wiped out the blood of his mouth, but he didn't have much chance to think about it, because the other three Taming Dragon Arhats tapped again toward Luo Zheng. They all have a True Dragon in their body, and all the dragon scales on the True Dragon are flashing with rays of light 

       


If you are really photographed by the three palms of these three Taming Dragon Arhat, I am afraid I will be seriously injured!

 , !


Under the impact of just now, Luo Zheng actually retired in the corner of the inner courtyard. Under Luo Zheng's teeth, the figure penetrated the space again, and it was instantly intertwined with the three Taming Dragon Arhats, and flashed to another one. In the middle of the corner!

     , !


"A little trouble," Luo Zheng frowned.

However, Luo Zheng is not without a solution, pure power can not be broken, he can naturally use other wrists!

   !


Thinking of this, Luo Zheng is slightly raising his head 

At this moment, above the starry sky of this round of universe, there are enough three hundred stars to start shining rays of light!

   !


The distribution of these three hundred stars is different, and there are stars in Middle Heaven Domain, West Tianyu, Nantianyu, Beitianyu and Dongtianyu!

     , !


Under Luo Zheng's summon, there is a strong starlight. These starlights are directed to the Great World, where Dream Battlefield is located. These three hundred stars are also one of the achievements of Luo Zheng's diligent cultivation in recent years.

     


In fact, using Divine Go-Sword, Luo Zheng is also confident to deal with the four Taming Dragon Arhat.

 , 


But Luo Zheng is using Star War Physique at the moment and wants to verify his guess 

 


When that starlight began to condense around Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng already had the answer.

 , 


"Sure enough, this Dream Battlefield is not really a dream space, it is the super Great World that existed in this universe Otherwise, I am afraid it is difficult to communicate to strength of stars! "

"   , !"


The many stars on this universe are able to shine here, and Luo Zheng is confirmed.

   


The power of Star War Physique is enough to be one of Luo Zheng's trump cards, so in the past six years, Luo Zheng has not given up the communication star, and even spent a lot of time, assigned to the cultivation "Star War Physique"! If you can't use it in Dream Battlefield, it's a big loss for Luo Zheng.

   , ! , 


Fortunately, Luo Zheng found that his concerns are superfluous, at least, he can smoothly condense starlight!

   !


When Luo Zheng's body was coated with a magnificent starlight, he took the figure and went straight to the Taming Dragon Arhat.

   


Just now Taming Dragon Arhat, which was smashed by Luo Zheng, has now been fixed. At this moment, the four Taming Dragon Arhat stand in a row, uniting their own palms in one piece!

   , !


"Hey "

Accompanied by the sound of four dragons!

The four True Dragons on the four Taming Dragon Arhats roared at the same time!

 , !


The green rays of light bloom, and the rays of light are almost hard to see!

How powerful is the power contained in the eight palms?

Luo Zheng is not willing to step back, or dodge 

Perhaps Luo Zheng has other ways to deal with it, but Luo Zheng also understands that Dream Battlefield is only open soon. He will face the supreme talent of the entire universe. He has never come back to other Divine Sea Realm geniuses! Over the past few years, Ai Anxin of Vast Cloud Heavenly Palace has probably made great progress. Luo Zheng may not be able to beat her, not to mention the supreme talent of Myriad Buddha Saint Domain and Thoughtless Gods. Supreme talent, as well as Monster Night Race, and Demon Race, as well as the strange race of innumerable in the universe.

     !       , 


So Luo Zheng needs a self-review to review the results of the years of hard work.

"buzzz "

Luo Zheng's began to flash a starlight.

These starlights are shaped like a piece of cotton wool that floats in his hands and looks like no weight, but the power of it is not to be underestimated.

   


Three hundred starlights are combined together, red orange yellow green, white purple blue red, a variegated starlight formed by the colorful colors blend with each other and begin to become extremely unstable!

     !


After this variegated starlight was produced, Luo Zheng took it out for the first time. Even if he hesitated a time of breathing, Luo Zheng would probably be involved in it, and the power of this starlight broke out!

     !


"Brilliance of Stars !"

"Weng~"

A sharp bang broke out from this variegated starlight!

At this moment, the starlight just arrived at the four Taming Dragon Arhat 

 , 


Explode!"

This group of starlight, combined with the power of three hundred stars, broke out, repelling each other, blending, reacting, and bursting out of the rays of light is extremely prosperous!

       !


The entire inner courtyard is completely covered by the Brilliance of Stars' rays of light, and you can't see the situation!

   !


However, the tall golden Buddha in the depths of this ancient temple, but opened his eyes, staring at the inner court, expression is not happy.

   , 


Among the eyes of this golden Buddha, it is to see that the four Taming Dragon Arhat are constantly shattering, and the four True Dragon stone carvings on the shoulders of Arhat are also beginning to shatter Although their within the body has a golden light emerging, trying to repair itself, but the golden light just appeared, it was taken in by starlight and annihilated 

       


"Menjinakkan Naga Arhat, tidak bisa dibunuh, bantu aku menguji bocah kecil ini, kursi ini, aku ingin melihat langkah apa yang dia ambil, Severing Emosi Divine Dao ..."

"     "


Setelah itu, Buddha emas melambaikan bunga lotus di tangan kiri, dan bunga lotus menyala dengan ringan. Taming Dragon Arhat, yang seharusnya dihancurkan, dipulihkan.

   , 


Apotheosis Chapter 1202 - Comrade Mao

The golden light of the four Taming Dragon Arhats was originally annihilated by starlight.   

 , 


But under the intervention of the Golden Giant Buddha, the golden light greatly rises of the Taming Dragon Arhat within the body, the already broken stone statues are quickly blended together and restored to the original!

   , !


The starlight scattered in this inner courtyard gradually dimmed.

Luo Zheng's figure gradually appeared, and as he looked at the four intact Taming Dragon Arhat, an unexpected accident appeared in his eyes, his face became cold.

   , 


The statues of the four Taming Dragon Arhats are so powerful that they are so powerful?

This Brilliance of Stars was first used by Luo Zheng, but the most explosive one in Star War Physique, Luo Zheng has no doubt about its powerful destructive power.

   


Such power could not tear the four Taming Dragon Arhats, which was obviously beyond the expectations of Luo Zheng's and even confused him.

   


The eighteen Arhats, one by one, came to the inner court. The strength of Arhat in each inner court will be slightly stronger, but the strength span between each Arhat is not large.

   , 


This Taming Dragon Arhat is the last inner court, and the strength is slightly stronger and normal!

 , !


But Luo Zheng is so unable to kill the four Arhats, which is a bit tricky.

   


Naturally, he couldn't see that the Taming Dragon Arhat was restored as it was because of some intervention later 

   


The four Taming Dragon Arhat didn't stop at all, and as the Dragon Dragon's dragon scales of light flashed on their shoulders, they again came in a few directions toward Luo Zheng.

   


If you change other Martial Artists, I am afraid that this situation will be on the verge of despair.

But for Luo Zheng, the trouble in front of me is just a hassle.

In the face of the four Taming Dragon Arhats in the bag, Luo Zheng's face was unsatisfactory, and the Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword was raised again. The narrow sword was hung on one side, and a faint Sword Intent was like a viper. I am continually swallowing around the sword!

     , !


Luo Zheng's gaze became cold and cold, as if he had become an expressionless stone at this moment.

   


Just as Luo Zheng raised Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword, the eyes of the giant Buddha in the depths of this ancient temple shimmered 

 , 


"Sure enough, this son has repaired Severing Emotions Divine Dao Although there is no completion, but with Divine Sea Realm cultivation base, I realized that the Heartless Sword Intent is the ultimate. If he finishes the last severing emotions and understands the ultimate Sword Intent, this sword will surely Great accomplishment ! "

"         !"


After the talk, the Golden Giant Buddha raised the lotus flower in his hand, and the lotus flower turned around in front of him.

   


There is a fork above the branches of the lotus flower, and the top of the fork is a lotus and the lotus flower.

   


Golden Giant Buddha came to the fore, but he took out the huge Buddha Hand and picked it up to the lotus. He took out a golden lotus seed from the lotus.

   


"If I smell, myriad laws are the origins, the past is not available, now the heart is not available, the future is not available "

"     "


When the Golden Giant Buddha chanted, the golden lotus flower seemed to melt and turned into a drop of pure gold liquid, rolling continuously in front of the Golden Giant Buddha.

   , 


As the golden water continues to roll, it begins to transform into infinite shapes, limbs, body, skull 

     


In the end, the golden lotus seed became a small figure, and the size of the small figure was as great as Luo Zheng.

   


Golden Giant Buddha uses the "Never Existed Karma Scripture" to calculate the life of Luo Zheng!

The method of this calculation is also the Great Divine Ability of the divine skill. By contrast, the calculation of many Heavenly Venerate under this round of Heavenly Dao is also considered as child's play!

   , !


But the Golden Giant Buddha is half-finished, but among the huge eyes, there is a strange color, and there is still a faint color in this strange color 

   


After a long time, Golden Giant Buddha said, "It's Fateless Cultivator, how can a Fateless Cultivator come out "

  " , "


It is estimated that half of the progress has not been carried out.

The golden lotus was turned into the shape of Luo Zheng's, but that face should have been the same, just like Luo Zheng, but at this moment the face of this golden subordinate seems to be covered with a layer of fog, unable to condense into a shape!

     , !


"But it, this seat wants to see, how long can you hold on?"

Golden Giant Buddha is calculating that Luo Zheng has taken action 

Divine Go-Sword is sacrificed, the sword light is invincible!

The power of the four Taming Dragon Arhats that rely on the True Dragon stone on the shoulders is indeed impressive, but it does not stop the invasion of this sword light!

 , !


This sword with no emotions slammed out, and the four waists of Taming Dragon Arhat, which had gone straight to Luo Zheng, had a thin line!

   !


"pu pu pu pu !"

Then there were four sounds of muffled sound coming from.

The four Taming Dragon Arhats were cut into two pieces by Luo Zheng, separated from the beginning and the end, and fell to the ground.

   


But the wound that was opened by Luo Zheng immediately broke out of the golden light, and the golden light shone, creating a strange force between the bodies, once again bonding each other together.

     


These magical abilities are almost comparable to the Unextinguishable Body. No matter how Luo Zheng kills, these four Taming Dragon Arhat can always recover!

   , !


In the face of this wonder, Luo Zheng looked cold and cold, but his mood was not touched.

   


At this moment, Luo Zheng's heart is like a cold and cold, without any thoughts, only a calm and calm heart, just want to kill these four Taming Dragon Arhat.

   , 


"pu pu pu pu "

Another number of muffled sounds came!

The four Taming Dragon Arhats didn't get up yet, and Luo Zheng's sword was once again pulled out.

 , 


The sword light contains a cold and cruel Sword Intent that spreads into a fan and squats on the body of this Taming Dragon Arhat 

   


Again.

Not waiting for these Taming Dragon Arhat to reinforce each other, Luo Zheng's sword has been released!

"One sword "

"Two swords "

"Three swords "

Luo Zheng is a sword and a sword, and the fan-shaped sword light spreads again and again.

 , 


In the beginning, he cut these Taming Dragon Arhat into two pieces, then four pieces, eight pieces Finally, it was cut into a pile of rocks.

   


If there is an outsider again, it is already impossible to tell what the original rock is, even the True Dragon stone carving is also broken into a slap-sized piece of stone by Luo Zheng.

   , 


However, these irregular stone cross-sections still shine a little golden light, and each stone is constantly shaking, attracting each other, it is to stick together and return to the previous Taming Dragon Arhat!

     , !


But Luo Zheng does not give them a chance!

The sword in his hand did not stop at all, nor did he keep his hand.

After severing emotions, Luo Zheng's mentality will change drastically, or he will take the initiative to leave this severing emotions state, and the four Taming Dragon Arhats will have no possibility of recovery, otherwise Luo Zheng will not be able to stop.

     


Under the slash of the sword of Luo Zheng, the golden light on the cross section of the stone is getting dil.

 , 


This golden light is overbearing and can restore the wounds of Taming Dragon Arhat to the original!

Golden light is the power of the Buddhist scriptures of the past!

The Buddha's heart is in the past, and it is difficult to recover through Life and Death Tribulation 

The golden light is to restore the stone statue of this Taming Dragon Arhat to the state before it was smashed!

   !


However, the stone statue is a stone statue after all. This golden light is not endless. After Luo Zheng smashed it over and over again, and the more and more broken, the golden light gradually dimmed!

     !


"If I still want to recover, I will crush you into powder!"

Luo Zheng's emotionless voice sounded, and the Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword in his hand still pulled out and shattered the stones!

   !


Seeing that the rays of light are getting more and more bleak, Luo Zheng understands that it should be coming to an end.

   


He thought so in his heart, but at this moment, the golden light in the cross section of the gravel was skyrocketing in an instant, ten times more bright than the previous golden light!

     !


At the same time, this finely broken stone, the frequency of shaking is accelerated, it is to stick together crazy!

   , !


Huh?

Luo Zheng also noticed something wrong!

Obviously the golden light that has been fading, but released the light in a moment?

The sword in his hand did not stop at all, but his eyes looked at the depths of this ancient temple. He was aware of a slight flaw. Just now, seems to be someone intervening?

   , ?


It is also this Golden Giant Buddha that has raised a glimpse of his mind. His Buddha's heart has been Mahayana, but seeing Luo Zheng exhibiting such a cold-spoken sword move, and it seems to be easy to apply, the heart has a consideration.

     


This Divine Sea Realm's little brat, the size of a Divine Sea is only a few, as if you can not use True Essence to perform such a martial skill?

   ?


=============================

===========================


=============================

===========================


Apotheosis Bab 1203

Buddha Raksasa Emas ini bisa melepaskan Luo Zheng.   

 


Dia benar-benar mengandalkan kekuatannya sendiri dan selamat dari delapan belas Arhat.

Hanya pada saat ini, ada sedikit rasa ingin tahu di jantung Buddha Raksasa Emas ...

Artis Bela Diri Alam Dewa Laut Setelah Laut Divine dibuka di Dantian, Essence Sejati dicairkan dan diubah menjadi air laut di Dunia Tubuh Internal.

   


Esensi Sejati dengan demikian ditampung jauh lebih banyak daripada sebelumnya, tetapi pada akhirnya terbatas.

   


Laut Ilahi Alam Laut Ilahi adalah ukuran "satu sembilan" dalam agama Buddha.

   " " 


Menurut kesimpulan Golden Giant Buddha, Divine Go-Sword ditampilkan seperti Luo Zheng, tetapi jumlah maksimum dua pedang.

   


Pedang sudah cukup untuk mengambil setengah dari lautan Essence Sejati dengan tubuhnya.

Dua pedang, True Essence akan mengering ...

Bahkan jika bakat Luo Zheng ini berbeda, Lautan Ilahi lebih luas dari rata-rata orang, tetapi bagaimanapun, itu tidak dapat lepas dari jumlah sembilan, tiga pedang adalah batasnya.

   , 


Jika Luo Zheng memiliki masalah besar, buka pihak kedua Laut Ilahi, paling tidak terlalu banyak pedang ...

   


Di antara alam semesta, jika Anda memiliki Artis Bela Diri Alam Laut Ilahi, Anda dapat mengambil "Pedang Pergi Ilahi" dari keempat pedang. Itu sudah merupakan bakat tertinggi dari Pengaruh Besar, kehadiran utama!

   " "   !


Namun, ekspresi Luo Zheng ini dengan tenang mengeluarkan tujuh belas pedang!

Buddha Raksasa Emas ini tidak dapat menemukannya. Bagaimana orang ini melakukannya?

Kecuali jika ada harta di Luo Zheng, Anda dapat menambah tubuh True Essence dalam sekejap, atau kultivasi. Anda dapat mengekstrak Essence Sejati dari suatu tempat ... Tetapi dengan mata Golden Giant Buddha, bagaimana Anda tidak melihatnya?

     ?


Di bawah keraguan seperti itu, Buddha Raksasa Emas ingin menggali melalui persendian sebelum menambahkan cahaya keemasan dari empat Arhat Naga Taming ...

   


When Luo Zheng was on True Extinction Road a few years ago, when Second Senior Brother was encountered, Second Senior Brother also had this doubt.

   


It's not that the Second Senior Brother's vision is more vicious than the Golden Giant Buddha, but the Second Senior Brother used to be accompanied by the Master, but knew that the Master had the conditions for the third person.

   


It is not difficult to guess that the Luo of the Divine Sea is the Qi of Primal Chaos, which is the sea of primal chaos, which is not the same as the sea of True Essence, so it can be seen at a glance.

     


The Golden Giant Buddha knows the existence of Qi of Primal Chaos, but the Qi of Primal Chaos is known as the source of all beings, but it is also the poison of all beings. If it is not the Great Divine Ability, it will die.

   , 


How can I imagine that someone in this world can realize a "Primordial Chaos Secret Technique"?

How can you imagine how someone can practice this "Primordial Chaos Secret Technique" in this world?

 , ?


Looking at the Taming Dragon Arhat, which quickly recovered, Luo Zheng's face once again showed helplessness 

 , 


Qi of Primal Chaos is not fast, and Luo Zheng can still smash the Taming Dragon Arhat into pieces, but these things can always be restored by the golden light.

   


When is this going, when is it?

Come again last time!

Luo Zheng is not an easy person to give up. Going this step, easily give up the personality that does not match him!

   !


These gravel are constantly glued together and gradually become human, but the body surface is covered with countless cracks 

   


They didn't take shape, and the Sword Intent on Thunder Storm Underworld Divine Sword started to flash again!

 , !


"break for me !"

"pu pu pu pu "

Once the ten swords went out, the Taming Dragon Arhat was again turned into pieces, and the rays of light between the pieces began to fade again.

   


"Are you still here?"

Luo Zheng looked at the Taming Dragon Arhat with a complex complexion, and there was a hint of dignity in his gaze. If the golden light was once again turned from bad to decay, he really couldn't help it.

   , 


After a breath, the golden light on the cross section of the stone is again greatly rises 

This scene made Luo Zheng speechless.

His gaze is to cross the door of the inner court, but there is no focus in the eyes. It seems to be quite meaningful in the past!

   , !


It was also Luo Zheng's gaze, which made the Golden Giant Buddha feel a little moved.

"This son is keen, he did not see me exist, but I know that I exist This is the last time, if you can't find your limits, I will stop," Golden Giant Buddha indifferently said.

"     ," 


Unfortunately, this time Luo Zheng did not cooperate!

"Eight Tunes Flying Smoke !"

Luo Zheng's body surface escapes a trace of white mist!

After he chose not to kill the Taming Dragon Arhat, the tiny stones were quickly glued to each other. After a while, the four Taming Dragon Arhats were restored.

   , 


But Luo Zheng casts this Eight Tunes Flying Smoke, which is easy to walk between these Taming Dragon Arhats. Their strength is fierce, but they can't get close to Luo Zheng's three-inch distance, no matter how perfect these four Taming Dragon Arhats are. Innocent cooperation, Luo Zheng is like a slippery fish, easy to swim in it.

       


That Taming Dragon Arhat's offensive is fierce, and the punch is heavy. But this punch is punched out. With the sound of the dragon, the Strength of Dragon Scales has fallen into the air!

     , !


Luo Zheng is more leisurely and self-satisfied, stretching his body easily, as if floating in the water, being pushed around by these Taming Dragon Arhats, but the body has never had any touches and no blows.

     , 


And his gaze, from time to time, fell on the door of the inner court, and occasionally his face was still sarcasm.

   


"This child, play with me "

Luo Zheng's move, in turn, made the Golden Giant Buddha helpless.

In the end, the Buddha shook his head and reached out and smashed the incense of the four Taming Dragon Arhat. The four Taming Dragon Arhat kept their original posture at this moment, standing still. It is.

     , 


"Oh!"

The door of the eighteenth inner court was finally opened for Luo Zheng.

Luo Zheng's face was a natural expression, and he stepped up his legs and bypassed the immobile Taming Dragon Arhat, walking towards the inner courtyard gate!

   , !


When Luo Zheng used "Eight Tunes Flying Smoke", he made a decision in his mind, which was consumed by the people behind the scenes.

   


I didn't expect the effect to be really good. The other party didn't want to be embarrassed about it. I opened the door.

   


After the eighteen inner courts, they were still inner courts.

But there is no Arhat statue in the inner court, and there is a table in the middle.

 , 


A white jade is placed on the table to create the Command Token.

"This is the reward in this hole?"

Luo Zheng looked at the slightest sweep, but found the word "teleportation" written on this white jade!

 , " " !


"teleportation command ?"

The Great Teleportation Method in the universe can only be understood by the World Lord powerhouse.

Cultivation base to achieve that share, with the experience of mastering the world, can understand the law of Space Teleportation!

   !


This Space Teleportation also consumes True Essence. Even the World Lord powerhouse has to stop to supplement True Essence after four or five teleportation.

   


In the 100,000 Great World, in addition to relying on some extraordinary divine beast, teleportation is probably the best choice. When Luo Zheng is trapped in Immortal Mansion, those Heavenly Venerate are coming by teleportation. .

     


"With this teleportation command, you can perform universe teleportation and move your own position on a large scale?"

"   ?"


Luo Zheng originally had a lot of hope for this cave. After all, in order to enter this cave, he spent 300,000 dream points, not to mention the time in this cave!

   , !


When he saw the teleportation command, he also felt that the Command Token value returned 300,000 dream points.

 , 


The trouble that Luo Zheng is facing now is that the Martial Artists can't refuse to go out of town, or when the Martial Artist discovers Luo Zheng, they will hide in the Main City. Luo Zheng is nothing!

     !


Luo Zheng is in Dream Battlefield and is divided into fifty Great Worlds.

Not relying on the channel, wanting to cross a Great World is also a very time-consuming and laborious thing for Luo Zheng!

   !


Rely on this teleportation command Enough to let Luo Zheng shuttle back and forth between this Great World!

 !


Thinking of this, Luo Zheng's heart suddenly became hot!

After he reached out and grabbed the Command Token, he looked at the depths of the old temple again.

 , 


In this inner courtyard, there seems to be a Great Expert, but no matter who it is, it has little to do with Luo Zheng.

   , 


Put the teleportation command in the spatial space and Luo Zheng will turn away!

This time, I stepped out of the inner courtyard, but I didn't have to go through the 18-storey inner courtyard. The door was the outer courtyard!

   !


When Luo Zheng left the outer court, the long-lost six-winged light bug appeared again next to Luo Zheng, and the Maitreya Buddha quietly changed from a fierce face to a smiling face.

   , 


This road went out along the cave, and every 100 feet of the revolving light appeared again. Luo Zheng never left, and left the cave with a light road.

   , 


Just when Luo Zheng just walked to the entrance of the cave, he heard the sound of the outside, but saw the open space outside the cave, filled with a group of dream light points, below these yellow spots. There are several Martial Artist corpses here.

     , 


Apotheosis Bab 1204

Di luar lubang, ada tujuh atau delapan Seniman Bela Diri Pertarungan Setan yang bertarung dengan tiga Tikus Pemisah Surga!   

 , !!


Sebelum Luo Zheng memasuki gua, dia membunuh tiga Tikus Pemisah Surga, tetapi setelah itu, ada tiga lagi ...

   , 


Luo Zheng dapat menemukan gua-gua di sini, dan Artis Bela Diri lainnya juga dapat mengetahuinya!

Tentang Martial Artist pertama yang menemukan gua, tetapi tidak bisa mengalahkan Heaven Splitting Rat di sini, dan kembali ke Kota Utama untuk memanggil pendamping!

   !


Artis Bela Diri yang masih hidup itu masih tujuh atau delapan, tetapi melihat titik-titik mimpi terkondensasi menjadi bola, mengambang di udara, dan mayat Artis Bela Diri yang mati secara bertahap menghilang.

   , 


Luo Zheng secara acak menghitung poin mimpi. Kelompok cahaya terkondensasi, tentang kelompok kesepuluh, pasti telah dikalahkan oleh 10 Seniman Bela Diri oleh Heaven Splitting Rat dan dikirim kembali ke Kota Utama untuk dibangkitkan.

   , 


Martial Artist membunuh Martial Artist dan dapat mengambil poin Dream masing-masing untuk mereka gunakan sendiri!

Tapi Tikus Pemisah Surga ini tidak menyerap poin mimpi, tetapi Artis Bela Diri akan menghilangkan setengah dari poin mimpi setelah kematian, sehingga poin mimpi di depan kita menjadi tidak dimiliki!

   , !


Bagi Luo Zheng, ini hanyalah titik putih dari titik mimpi, di mana alasan untuk melepaskannya?

   ?


Aku melihat sosoknya menyala, dan kemudian melayang ke arah kelompok titik cahaya mimpi pertama, tubuhnya menyentuh dengan lembut, bintik-bintik cahaya kuning masuk ke dalam tubuhnya, dengan mudah diserap olehnya.

     


Mencolok

"Pengadilan mati!"

"Berani menyerap poin mimpi dari bayangan jahat kita, kami akan mengejar kamu sampai ke ujung bumi!"

" , !"


Tujuh atau delapan Demon Race Martial Artist masih berusaha untuk mengatasi tiga Heaven Splitting Rats. Ketika mereka melihat langkah Luo Zheng, mereka tiba-tiba menjadi marah dan meraung dan mendengar suara raungan!

   , !


The three Heaven Splitting Rats are still moving at that incredibly fast speed, and from time to time they use the sharp front teeth to bite a bite on these Demon Race Martial Artists. This is a bit of a Divine Tool-level armor. Throughout, even though Demon Race Martial Artist is thick and thick, at the moment they are also carrying a deep visible bone wound!

       !


This evil shadow 18 knows that there is a heavy treasure buried in the cave, but the three Heaven Splitting Rats are too strong and can only come together.

   


Under the battle, it was the sacrifice of the lives of ten people!

Fortunately, these Heaven Splitting Rats don't absorb dream light points. The dead Martial Artist is forcibly sent back to Main City. When they come back to life, they will come back and suck their own Dream points back.

   , 


They are intimate and intimate, but this can be trusted, so no one goes to the dream light points on the ground!

   !


Who knows that when the battle is taking place, a Martial Artist emerges from this cave, and they take the opportunity to absorb the dream points of their dead brothers. How can they bear it?

   , ?


"Evil Shadow 18?"

Upon hearing their anger, Luo Zheng's mouth was slightly tilted. For their warning, Luo Zheng did not look at it. He continued to rush toward the group of dream light points and quickly scattered the light scattered on the ground. Absorption.

     , 


Three thousand points 

Eight thousand points 

Four thousand points 

This is the number of dream light points scattered on the ground, although there are not many, but each group has thousands of dream points in any case.

   


Luo Zheng has absorbed this, and the dream points of the body are also growing rapidly!

After the absorption of the 10 mission light points, he already had 50,000 Dream points, and with the remaining 10,000 Dream points, Luo Zheng's dream points returned to the level of 60,000 in an instant.

   , 


"Ahhhh "

With a scream, a Demon Race Martial Artist was again on the spot! The Demon Race Martial Artist is the head of the Heaven Splitting Rat!

 , ! !


The red light wraps the soul of this Demon Race Martial Artist, flies in the direction of the Main City, and a group of Dream points burst out, fluttering above his corpse.

   , 


The remaining six Demon Race Martial Artists are also slightly glimpsed. It seems that conditioned reflexes generally look to Luo Zheng, which Luo Zheng will not swallow this dream points! This is too much, man.

   ! !


Their thoughts have just risen, and Luo Zheng's figure disappeared in the same place. In the blink of an eye, he appeared next to the dead now Demon Race Martial Artist corpse, and swallowed all the dream points 

     


The six Demon Race Martial Artists saw this scene, they were filled with anger, and they were blind and eager to live. Luo Zheng!

   , !


"First kill this fellow!"

"kill him and solve this Heaven Splitting Rat "

"That's awful!"

The six Demon Race Martial Artists no longer pay attention to the three Heaven Splitting Rats, saying that they must kill Luo Zheng first!

 , !


Coincidentally, two of the three Heaven Splitting Rats actually rushed to Luo Zheng at the same time.

   


In the face of this scene, Luo Zheng's expression is indifferent, in his mind, this Dream Battlefield does not exist abominable and excessive.

   , 


Everyone is fighting for the rankings. This is a big wave of sand, the weak are eliminated from Dream Battlefield, and the powerhouse will stand in the middle of the stage! This is the meaning of the existence of Dream Battlefield.

   , ! 


In the face of several sieges of Demon Race Martial Artist and Heaven Splitting Rat, there is a white fog around Luo Zheng's body!

 , !


"Eight Tunes Flying Smoke !"

Still Eight Tunes Flying Smoke!

This movement technique is displayed, and no matter how fierce the opponent's offensive is, it is impossible to touch Luo Zheng's sleeves.

   


"This fellow's movement technique is so weird!"There is Demon Race Martial Artist.

"We have surrounded him a few "

"You are going around this fellow "

However, a more bizarre scene appeared in front of these Demon Race Martial Artists.

The speed of Heaven Splitting Rat was originally very fast, and the speed of Luo Zheng itself may be far worse, but when Heaven Splitting Rat rushed to Luo Zheng's moment, this Eight Tunes Flying Smoke turned Luo Zheng into a smoky smoke. With a little fluctuation, you can launch Luo Zheng! The distance between Luo Zheng and this Heaven Splitting Rat is always three inches apart!

     , ! !


So in the eyes of this Demon Race Martial Artist, Luo Zheng's speed is also suddenly increasing, and the speed is almost the same as Heaven Splitting Rat!

   !


Because this speed is too fast, they can hardly capture Luo Zheng's figure, how can they surround Luo Zheng?

   ?


While playing Eight Tunes Flying Smoke, Luo Zheng also did not forget to push the Qi of Primal Chaos into the ground to form a mysterious white aperture!

   !


Using the Thunder Tribulation Kill to deal with Heaven Splitting Rat, Luo Zheng has had two experiences. This time, it is still the same. After all, the three Heaven Splitting Rats also have three thousand dream points. The only difference is that this time Luo Zheng It was the "circle" that came in front of these Demon Race Martial Artists.

     , " " 


Soon after, there was a terrible momentum in the sky, accompanied by a frantic thunder, and everything in this white aperture was embraced by Heavenly Tribulation 

   , 


With a burst of unwillingness, the six Demon Race Martial Artists turned into six red spots and went straight to the Main City. The three Heaven Splitting Rats also burst into the eyes and turned into countless small dreams. Light points.

     


These dream light points floated in the air for a while, and they flew into the Luo Zheng's fleshly body!

 , !


Six Demon Race Martial Artists can last until the end, the strength is stronger than the previously killed Demon Race Martial Artist, and the dream points are naturally more, with an average of one person also having 10,000 dream light points.

   , 


Coupled with the Dream points of three Heaven Splitting Rats, Luo Zheng's dream points has now recovered to 130,000!

 , !


"Luck is not bad," Luo Zheng smiled slightly, his body floating gently, his eyes looking far away.

" ,"   


There are countless Main Citys in this Great World, and Dream Battlefield is divided into fifty Great Worlds. Now that he owns the "teleportation command", he has not returned to the previous Main City. It is now Luo. Zheng Crazy to plunder the moments of dream points!

   " "  !


However, whether the teleportation command is as effective as it is inferred, and still needs to be verified.

 , 


Thinking of this, Luo Zheng took out the teleportation command made by the white jade, and then extracted the Qi of Primal Chaos in the sea of primal chaos and injected it into the teleportation command!

   , !


The teleportation command releases a shallow white light at the moment of activation, and then the white light is extinguished.

   


Seeing this scene, Luo Zheng's brows wrinkled slightly.

"This teleportation command Useless

Dia berpikir seperti ini, setelah napas berikutnya, perintah teleportasi di tangannya mulai bergetar hebat!

   !


Kekuatan Hukum Ruang yang kuat dilewatkan dari perintah teleportasi ini, dan sinar cahaya yang menyala adalah saat-saat yang melingkupi Luo Zheng seolah-olah matahari kecil terbit di hutan belantara ini!

   !


Setelah sekian lama 

Kelompok cahaya yang menyala-nyala ini menghilang, dan sosok Luo Zheng menghilang di tempatnya.


Apotheosis Bab 1205

Ketika perintah teleportasi diaktifkan, Luo Zheng masuk ke ruang yang indah.   

 , 


Di kaki Luo Zheng, ada titik-titik merah yang tak terhitung jumlahnya, dan pada saat ini, Luo Zheng bahkan sedikit khawatir.

   


Menurut dugaan Luo Zheng, perintah teleportasi ini mungkin untuk membantu Anda menampilkan teknik teleportasi besar, yang memungkinkan Anda untuk langsung bergerak melintasi puluhan ribu mil di Dunia Hebat ini.

   , 


Tentu saja, saya tidak berharap bahwa setelah perintah teleportasi ini diaktifkan, itu membuat saya masuk ke ruang yang luar biasa, yang sepenuhnya di luar ruang lingkup akal sehat!

   , !


"Titik merah di bawah ini harus mewakili semua Kota Utama di Dunia Hebat ini ... Lokasiku ada di sini!"

"   !"


Titik-titik merah di bawah ruang didistribusikan menurut jarak tertentu, dan ada titik cyan di sudut. Ada juga Kota Utama tidak jauh dari tempat cyan.

   


Kota Utama harus menjadi kota utama tempat Luo Zheng datang setelah memasuki ruang Impian. Saya tidak berharap ditugaskan ke ujung Dunia Hebat ini.

   , 


Seperti ini di peta, Kota Utama tidak jauh dari dirimu ...

 , 


Selain Kota Utama ini, Kota Utama lainnya masih berjarak dekat.

 , 


Luo Zheng bebas untuk mendorong melupakannya. Jika Anda mengandalkan kecepatan penerbangan Anda sendiri, akan butuh waktu lama untuk pergi ke Kota Utama lain yang berdekatan.

   


"Perintah teleportasi ini, bukankah itu hanya peta?"

Jika Anda baru saja menandai Kota Utama, Anda tidak dapat mentransfer Luo Zheng. Itu hanya peta. Dibutuhkan banyak upaya untuk mendapatkan peta. Investasi ini terlalu banyak melupakannya!

     !


Memikirkan hal ini, Luo Zheng dengan hati-hati meraba-raba!

Mengambang di ruang ini, Luo Zheng langsung menuju ke salah satu bintik merah.

 , 


Tepat ketika Luo Zheng baru saja sampai di puncak titik merah, titik merah kecil di bawahnya berbalik. Pusat dari titik merah kecil menghasilkan sedikit cahaya putih, dan cahaya putih berputar lebih cepat dan lebih cepat, melepaskan Hukum yang kuat. Kekuatan Ruang!

     !


"This is the Transmission Channel! and alsoThis Transmission Channel seems to be directly connected to the Main City represented by this red dot! "

" ! !"


Interesting

"In this way, aren't the main Main Citys allowed to choose?"

Luo Zheng's heart peng peng jumps straight, if so, he can easily rob the Great Main City in this Great World!

   !


This space is not large, only about a few tens of miles long, Luo Zheng surrounded in this space, whenever he passes a red dot, the red dot spreads out a Transmission Channel, waiting for Luo Zheng is coming. If Luo Zheng leaves completely, then the Transmission Channel will disappear again 

       


One of Great World has tens of thousands of Main City, and Luo Zheng's choice is too much.

"Hey, what are these spots?"

When Luo Zheng looked at the huge "map" below, he found that there were three spots in the center of the map. The distance between the three spots was not far.

 " "   


However, the color of these three spots is strange, blue-gray!

When Luo Zheng flew above the three spots, the blue-gray spot did not condense out of the Transmission Channel, and there was no response.

   


"The three light spots are also three Main City? Just can't enter now? "Luo Zheng judged.

" , ? ?" 


After paying attention to it, Luo Zheng did not stay above this spot, but chose to choose a red spot in the middle of the "map".

   " " 


The more the Great World is the edge of the Main City, the farther away from each other, the more the Main City in the center of the Great World, the closer the distance between them, the Martial Artist collision there should be more intense! This is also why Luo Zheng will choose this red spot.

     ! 


After choosing his own goal, Luo Zheng did not hesitate any more, and he rushed toward the red spot.

   


At the moment when Luo Zheng drilled, a Transmission Channel spread out above the red spot, and Luo Zheng was firmly wrapped!

   !


"Om"

At the moment of passing through the Transmission Channel, Luo Zheng's eardrums roared and there was a feeling of extreme discomfort.

   


After all, this form of "Transmission Channel" is different from the Transmission Channel in the ordinary sense. The general Transmission Channel only connects the two places, which can compress the distance between the two places by a hundred times, but the area of a Great World is too large, even The distance is compressed by a hundred times, and the Transmission Channel is still a short distance.

 " "     , 


And this teleportation command is actually a direct transfer of Luo Zheng teleportation, no matter how far away the destination is. This divine ability is the World Lord powerhouse. At this time, Luo Zheng can use the teleportation command in Dream Battlefield to reach it. Under the pressure of Law of Space, it is normal for Luo Zheng to adapt.

     , 


As the sound of his own eardrum vibrates more and more, Luo Zheng suddenly slams down!

 , !


In the center of the Main City, dozens of Martial Artists are sitting in the same place, but they are meditating on the knees.

   


Every Martial Artist participating in Dream Battlefield is fully prepared. The family also has a large number of top grade True Essence stones and True Essence Jade. Anyway, this Dream Battlefield is a projection in which the True Essence Jade is consumed. The outside True Essence Jade will not disappear.

     


Martial Artist battle, True Essence Jade is a must-have, but they don't dare to consume it too much. After all, the battle in this Dream Battlefield is not a two-game, the True Essence Jade in the hands are in a critical juncture. When they used it, they squatted back to the rest of Main City, and they wanted to absorb Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi.

       


"Weng~"

Along with a sharp sound, there was a white light group over the Main City, and among the light groups, there was a heavy object falling straight down!

   , !


The person who fell, naturally is Luo Zheng!

He was the first to use this teleportation command, and it was not clear where the teleportation command would take him. When he fell to a certain distance, he tried to stop his tendency to fall, but there was an invisible force. Himself, take him down!

     , !


After the white rays of light dissipated, Luo Zheng discovered that he had fallen into the heart of the Main City. At this moment, Luo Zheng also understood why he could not fly. This is in the Main City. The ban on the ban is naturally impossible to get rid of with his strength.

       


"plop!"

The momentum of his fall is still very fierce, and after this heavy squatting on the ground, a loud bang is heard.

   


When he got up from the ground, he saw a lot of Martial Artists around his eyes wide open, looking at Luo Zheng with a weird expression, and a whispering sound.

   , 


"This fellow It seems to have fallen from the sky! "

'How?' Main City has an air ban, and it is impossible to fly after crossing the city wall. How can he fall from the top of Main City? "

" !   ?"


"So how did he suddenly appear?"

These Martial Artists whispered and their faces were fascinating.

 , 


Luo Zheng did not care about these arguments.

He doesn't know if the teleportation command can be taken away from Dream Battlefield, whether it can be used outside, but Luo Zheng will not easily show it at the moment. As for how to appear in this Main City, let the helpers guess it. .

     


"Here is a Main City where the Human Race Martial Artist gathers "

After Luo Zheng looked at it, he came to the conclusion that the architecture of the Main City is the same as that of the Human Race, and the Martial Artists around Luo Zheng are also Human Race.

   , 


What race is not important to Luo Zheng. He chose to come to this Main City, naturally to challenge those fat wolves and accumulate their own dream points.

     


Thinking of this, Luo Zheng left the central area and was ready to go to the city to "trying one's luck".

   " " 


However, he was just about to leave, but a Martial Artist said: "You are the Martial Artist who just came to this Main City?"

 , :" ?"


Upon hearing this, Luo Zheng stopped and turned to look at the Martial Artist indifferently said: "Yes, what?"

   :" , ?"


"The Main City is a regular one. The first person registers and then pays half of the Dream points to the City Lord. Just now can leave safely," said Martial Artist, looking at Luo Zheng.

"    " 


"City Lord? Main City is not a city in Dream Battlefield, how can there be a City Lord? And my dream points are inseparable, how can I pay this City Lord? "Luo Zheng is a little glimpse.

" ? , ? , ?" 


The Martial Artist replied: "Whether other Main City has a City Lord, I don't know, but we have this Main City. As for paying dream points, the method is simple. You let the City Lord kill a natural one. I paid him half of it "

 :"     , "


Upon hearing this, Luo Zheng suddenly realized that his face was full of ridiculous smiles, but he was stunned by the word City Lord. Presumably, this City Lord is also a common character with the Demon Race Young Master Hao, relying on his own The forces squeezed the dream points of other Martial Artists.
