[Shia……is enviable, I also towards Hajime……]



The order is Kaori, Shizuku, Suzu, and why Arutena as well.



Then, at last, Shia notices her surroundings, Her face is dyed crimson red and she covers it up with both hands. However, her shame can’t hold back her joy, her rabbit ears were waving happily, even her tail was moving according to her joy ~Rifu~.



Then, Io came over at just the right time. It seems that the preparations of the Hauria tribe is finished. It was unreasonably quick.



Alfrerick and Arutena were seeing off Hajime’s group as they left on Feruniru*the airship* and flew off towards the Imperial capital.





Chapter 113




Miscellaneous.



What kind of place is the capital of the Hoelscher empire? Might(Strength) is the only words you need*Improvised and shortened down*.



If you investigate you’ll find the buildings are without affection and are practically placed in a row. Are the streets readjustments of town lots? Is there anything delicious*This line was odd*? There are entrances continuing to the back alley in disorder with big and small things here and there.



The atmosphere as well, there is tension strained everywhere like as if there was recently a disaster, even storekeepers who have opened a street stall serves people far from the idea of a “customer”.



However, it was dark and stagnated but never became too much, they were lively with freedom of doing whatever they wanted to do. They had the freedom to do whatever they wanted, their only responsibility were to themselves. This was the creed of the citizens of the imperial capital.



The Hoelscher empire is a new country that an active group of mercenary in a previous great war established, A military nation to which strength speaks for everything. Many of the citizens of the empire are no stranger to fights, to the point that its almost an illness. Theres a huge arena of a colossal size, the kind where there are events done many times throughout the year.



[Oi, you [Doga!!] gupe~!?]



It was Hajime who entered the Imperial capital, naturally Hajime was leading around beautiful women so it was understandable, this process has been repeating many times, before they were done talking they were already kissing the ground. Just now a man with weapons came by and was knocked down while talking and the force caused him to do a triple axel as he fell to the ground.



However, the people do not seem to think much about it. This level of “Fighting” might be an everyday experience for them.



[Uu, though i heard about it already… after all, the empire is unplesant desuu~.]



[Yes, i feel that way as well. ….In a sense its good that we weren’t summoned in this place.]



[Well, this is a military nation. Far from firepower being minimal, even the residents, there are many who have combat experience. The bad atmosphere is natural, the fighting is natural. Wanting to live is everyone’s desire, mistress.]



Apparently, Shea didn’t like the Imperial capital. Though Yue is silent, she also nods in agreement, after all this country isn’t liked by women. Especially for Shia, the things she sees breaks her heart one at a time.



[Shia, don’t look so much. ….There’s no helping them even if you see.]



[…..Yes, that’s right]



What Shia sees are slaves of the demi-human species. The slaves are being bought and sold actively. The empire allows the use of slaves, so business is very prosperous. There are children of the demi-human species turning their gaze to Shia as they were put in their cages with price tags on them, Shia’s expression is clouded.



Yue clenches Shia’s hand anxiously. Hajime as well, caresses Shia’s cheek ~munimuni~ with awkward consideration. The warmth of two people is transmitted to the hand and cheek, and the rabbit ears on Shia’s head moved around joyfully.



[…..I cannot permit it. Though we’re all living…. the slaves.]



Kouki who was walking behind Hajime was grinding his teeth. He seemed like he would charge right in if left alone.



The influence of the church is strong, even the Hairhi Kingdom has a strong sense of discrimination against demi-humans. The matter of keeping demi-humans as slaves tend to be evaded, because there was no chance of Kouki and them seeing how demi-humans were treated in the castle. Therefore, there might have been extra shock to their minds.



However, it would be bad if he actually charges at them….. Hajime promised in his heart that he would pretend to not know him immediately if such an event happened.



Though, we don’t have to worry because we have a reliable person here, the man of the world(Shizuku) is here so we don’t have to be worried at all. Now, Kouki is getting fired up while being lectured about this and that. Ryutaro, the muscle for brains fuels it, Suzu casually holds them down. In a sense, they make a good team. Though the team seems to fail quickly if not for the women….



[That’s right, wasn’t Shizuku proposed to by the Emperor?]



[…..That’s right, there was that too]



Shuzuku frowns as she remembers something she didn’t want to.



Yue looks at Shuzuku and lets out a sound, [hoo~], with a slight smirk. Shizuku, frowned more at the glance. Kouki has a bitter expression nearby. Apparently, not only the country but also the emperor seemed to be dislikeable.



[About that, Nagumo-kun. Where exactly are we going?]



Shizuku, dodging the women who seemed to want to hear the details at any moment, the talk was redirected to Hajime. Though the story of confirming the safeties of Shia’s father was heard, a concrete plan wasn’t heard yet.



[N~? the adventurer guild first of all. If the “Gold” rank is used, most information can be found through questioning]



[…..Does Nagumo-kun believe that he’s been caught?]



[I don’t know. If he has have been caught its possible he’s been made into a slave, its also possible that he’s just laying low somewhere too. The guards of the Imperial capital is on high alert, but to an abnormal level? To the point where its impossible to go out, entering was a good choice…..]



Hajime was right, and on a level was not an exaggeration to say that it was excessive. An empire soldier was stationed not as patrol on the outer wall and always kept a close watch until a physical checkup was done individually at the entrance gate.



Even in the city, the empire soldiers of a minimum of 3 man teams went glancing around not only in the main streets but also the back alleys. Perhaps it was due to the surprise attack of the demon, that would cause them to get ready for high-level caution even if there wasn’t an order yet.



Because the Imperial capital is in such a condition, Pal and them are having trouble with invading, and are waiting for a chance. The Usagininzoku*Rabbit people* who aren’t slaves can’t just pour on into the imperial capital, and there are limits to pretending to be Hajime’s slaves. Therefore, the reinforcement unit that Hajime brought is hiding in a remote rock zone away from the Imperial capital to not attract attention for now. Rather its strange how Cam’s group was able to invade it.



However, Hajime said, [I don’t know], its almost certain that Cam was caught by them already. As for the Usagininzoku,they were a demi-human race of first-rate stealth operations, and Cam continued to polish it. Even if going in and out is severe, he will likely be able to do something by sending a message to the outside by some method. If there are no signs, Its natural to think that



hes been caught already.



Of course, I don’t think that the information on Cam can be found at the adventurers guild. However, there might be the case of an event or rumor related to it.



Shia looking uneasy, Hajime extends his hand to caress her cheeks again ~munimuni~. Shia, though she likes when her ears are felt, her cheeks being caressed was also a favorite. Hajime, told a joke to Shia while laughing that left a feeling of uneasiness.



[If hes been caught, we only need to take him back. Don’t worry, shia. When the time comes, even if we have to turn the Imperial capital to ashes, we’ll get him back.]



[N….leave it to us, shia]



[Hajime-san, Yue-san….]



[nonono, do we have to turn it into ashes? Though your eyes aren’t laughing, is it really a joke? is it?]



[Shizuku-yan, the Imperial capital is already…..]



[You’ve already given up? Have you already given up, Kaori!?]



Was Hajime’s joke not really a joke? Though shizuku tsukkomied while her cheek cramped up, she began to panic because Kaori seemed to be sad and shook her head.



Actually, it seemed too much like a joke, because surely Hajime cannot destroy one whole country.



While Hajime walked on the main street towards the adventurers guild while joking about a joke that actually wasn’t, the state of the town began to change. Several buildings were collapsed, and there was debris scattered everywhere.



On the way, according to what they heard through their ears, the demon being managed in the coliseum for a duel, suddenly mutated and became a strong and huge demon which has never been seen before and it raged about. Suddenly the huge demon appeared at the center of the city (it seemed to be 30 meters in length.) the empire reacted afterwards and confronted it.



Finally, the Majinzoku*Devil Race* seems to take advantage and approached the emperor with a dash. While managing the demon by going to the front personally, the emperor was able to repel the Majinzoku somehow….The compensation was large no matter how you looked at the state of the town.



It started at the colosseum which meant that it collapsed radially, at the miserable sight, many demi-human slaves were barefoot and brought out to remove the debris in great number.



Because of the collapse on the other side there were watchmen surveying the intense place, though we need to get to the adventure guild, due to nature, we watched. It reminded me of how the pyramids were constructed in ancient Egypt, the state of having to carry debris with a gloomy expression while under severe monitoring and abuse from the armed empire soldiers, which put a finished setting to the word misery.



The side effects of the damages in the Imperial capital seems to effect the demi-humans more than anyone else. Even though demi-humans are known for their physical powers, If one is overworked they’ll definitely fall down and then someone will appear and beat them until they get back up.



If they don’t get back up, the empire would simply attack the Sea of Trees to gain more supply of slaves because they don’t see demi-humans as people. Or, the sense of values that strength reigns supreme and only the “weak” are excluded. The purpose of Arutena being transported to another city is also to replace previous slaves.



Just then, a boy around 10 years old with dog ears and tail tripped on some debris and fell down loudly, all the debris contained in his cart also fell out. The inumimi*Dog eared* boy was crouching down enduring the pain of his foot, the empire soldiers of the watch had a dangerous look, he began to approach with a club in hand. It’s obvious what he plans on doing.



And, the ally of justice couldn’t remain silent about something about to happen right in front of him.



[Oi! Stop….]



Kouki, tries to run out while raising a loud voice to stop the empire soldier. However, he was stopped by the event that happened in the next moment.



Pashu~!



At the same time as the subtle sound was heard through the air, the empire soldier toppled down like a brick and dove onto the debris.



Gosha! an indescribably miserable sound was heard, the empire soldier who was approaching the inumimi boy didn’t move an inch. Apparently he fainted somehow. Afterwards the empire soldiers co-worker came rushing in a hurry, after seeing his condition, he shook his head with an amazed expression and carried him away somewhere. Leaving behind the inumimi boy.



The inumimi boy, just looked with a blank surprised expression for a while as he didn’t understand what just happened, He then quickly rakes up all the fallen debris that fell out and resumed his job as if nothing happened.



Kouki who was going to begin running was stunned and baffled. Then, Hajime’s voice ranged out.



[Though i don’t care if you thrust your neck into something troublesome, at least prevent it from troubling us?]



[N….was that you just now Nagumo-kun?]



Hajime shrugs his shoulder towards Kouki’s question. Actually, the empire soldier stumbled and fell because of the needle that was shot out from his artificial arm. Apart from having been helped earlier by me, Kouki, frowned at the word “troublesome”. Apparently, i’ve seemed to flip on his justice switch.



[What is troublesome. ….Is it bad to help? Even you helped me]



[If anything, stopping you from making a scene is the correct choice. If you went and stopped him more empire soldiers would have shown up and it would have become a riot. We came here to look for a person. Not to cause extra commotion. Can you not cause an unnecessary uproar, if you’re going to cause one at least do it away from us so it won’t be a nuisance]



While giving an indifferent answer while waving his hand, Kouki heats up and sends their purpose of finding Shia’s dad into the corner of his mind, He began to appeal for the sense of values of his ethics and justice.



[You, as your watching the demi-humans, do you think of it as nothing at all! Look, now, at this time, they are suffering!]



[Haa~, hey Yaegashi*Shizuku*, quickly do something about this fool whos lost sight of our purpose. I’m leaving it in your care]



Hajime also, Myuu was helped before. If a child suffers in front of his presence, he feels nothing at all*In case you guys are confused, this is because he got to know Myuu, so she wasn’t a “random” child*. Be an adult….do something about it yourself, think what you want.



However, even after the original purpose was said, i can’t work on the emancipation of slaves, so i left it to Yaegashi because its troublesome to play with Kouki.



Shizuku, though a sigh was let out….ahead of that, Kouki raised his voice in anger. Apparently, he seems to not like that Hajime had relied on Shizuku for this incident.



[Shizuku has nothing to do with this! Right now, im talking with you! You value Shia, so why are you deserting these demi-humans!]



As Kouki’s voice became loud, people in the surroundings began to pay attention. Some of the remote empire soldiers and watchdogs began to glance towards Hajime frequently.



Since Hajime is an outsider and is looking for Cam who is currently hostile with the empire, he didn’t want to stir up anymore unnecessary trouble with the authorities. Therefore, he rolled his eyes abruptly towards Kouki.



[…..Amanogawa*Kouki*. I’ll say it one more time for you who has bad memory. Alright? i don’t want to hear your repetitious complaining, and i don’t plan on having a debate on ethics or sense of justice. I don’t recognize you as companions, so i don’t intend to get along with you. After all you asked for “permission” and “followed” along. Therefore, don’t rush in by yourself,



its unsightful. If you make too much noise…..should I crush your limbs and send you back to the Kingdom?]



[Kh…..]



[I said it a while ago, but i don’t intend to interfere with you either. Therefore, while your still in range don’t do anything that will trouble us. We came here to look for Cam. There is no time to be distracted on other things. …..And Shia is more important than other demi-humans to me]



Hajime, turned away from Kouki’s glare, as if uninterested.



Slavery, its completely natural in this world. Though they’re certainly receiving cruel treatment, it’s “bad” to help a demi-human thats been enslaved in general. Because it counts as stealing another persons “possession”.



“Still” it’s probably necessary to think about it eventually. The resolution to fight against the empire itself to create a method of abolishing the slavery of the demi-humans. As it is, even if we help the slaves with force, there’s a threat of retaliation and the demi-humans would be captured and treated more harshly than ever before.



Does he finally understand, if not….. Kouki stares at the back of Hajime and doesn’t move. Still being urged by shizuku and them, he finally let it go reluctantly.



Kouki, though he’s accompanying Hajime with permission, if what Hajime said about gods were true and others as strong as Nointo*White haired angel that Kaori is currently using as her body* will be appearing more often, then he has to obey, because it would be too difficult to obtain power otherwise.



To be able to obtain the Age of Gods magic by obeying Hajime was certainly the best choice. Therefore, he held back the ill feelings in his chest and became silent.



With the delicate atmosphere(only Kouki’s group) they reached the adventurers guild at last.



There are tables put in the large space for miscellaneous things, and two counters. One counter for the procedures and receptionist, who was also a woman, while the other counter was a bar. There are fellows drinking in the daytime here and there, if there wasn’t, i felt like tsukkomi-ing to help with its revival.



When Hajime set foot inside, due to his familiar encounters he understood. In other words, vulgar glances would be placed on Yue and them. Therefore, Hajime while moving towards the counter used “Pressure” as soon as he stepped in.



As expected of a military nation, even as they drank there was no one who fainted, they began to expose caution and sobered up all together.



The receptionist at the counter, there’s no radiance from her as seen in the other towns. Only looking down on Hajime with an expression of no motivation. I get the feeling that i should state my business quickly.



[I want information. Recently, was there any demi-humans which caused a commotion here in the Imperial capital a few days ago?]



[…..]



To Hajime’s question, the receptionist gives Hajime a suspicious look. This is because the content of the question was strange.



You only have to go to the slave association of the merchant guild if you wanted information of a slave, even then slaves cannot cause a commotion in the Imperial capital. That is because a slave’s collar seals off most of the resistance. And, Hajime’s question does not change, what he’s asking is something impossible in the Imperial capital unless they weren’t a slave.



Result, the receptionist pointed towards the bar counter, whether its a regular system or it became too troublesome to deal with.



[…..Such information can be heard there]



As Hajime looks towards the counter, he sees the figure of a man past middle age, polishing glass, apparently the bar also counted as a place for information gathering. The receptionist returned to doing what she was before, as if declaring that her work is done.



Hajime shrugs his shoulder and walks towards the bar counter.



There are dangerous glares appearing from the adventurers, Kouki and Ryutaro also react and glare back. Suzu seemed to be weak in these cases and shrinks back behind Shizuku. Holding the hem of Shizuku’s clothes, she looked cute for a moment.



Hajime goes up to the counter and asks the same question to the bartender. However, the other party just kept polishing glass while disregarding it. Hajime’s eyes narrowed.



Then,



[This here is a bar, Not a place for children to come and play around. I don’t plan on having anything to do with people who can’t drink. Leave quickly]



so he’s looking for a drinking master*these 2 sentences are weird to me, i don’t know what Tenpuremasuta is, though i understand its a refference to something*. Then I’ll give him a drinking master! Hajime’s tension began to increase. He’s still just polishing glass to make it shiny, but he values his reputation. If you come here, and the liquor is drunk in great loads, he’ll definitely be delighted.



Hajime, places money on the counter with an poker face while secretly being happy about being able to taste a fantasy game hero’s feelings. From the darkness in the corner of his mind, a mini-Hajime asked, [You called?], peeping out.



[That’s true. Master, I ask for the strongest and worst quality liquor you have in this shop]



[……If you vomit, i’ll kick you out]



The master, the moment Hajime ordered, reluctantly pulled out a bottle from the shelf behind him and his eyebrow twitched slightly as he placed it on the counter with a pikui~ sound.



Adventurers were all staring at Hajime because they felt cautious that he wasn’t just a kid, they understood due to the pressure he released.



Hajime picks up the bottle and abruptly cuts the tip off with his finger tips. The action itself was fluid and people who understood held their breath. Even the master’s eyes were widening a little.



A strong alcoholic smell drifts from the bottle as soon as it was open, Shia and Kaori who was by his side instinctively covered their nose due to the fumes. Kouki and them also backs away while groaning “Uu”.



[hey, Nagumo-kun? So, do you have to drink that? Shouldn’t you stop?]



[yes, that’s right. you’ll absolutely vomit. Suzu already seems to want to vomit]



[In the first place Hajime, lets have it be a better liquor if your going to drink it anyways]



[Its as Kaori says, Hajime. Why did you purposely ask for that one…..]



Shizuku and them relay their complaints without restraint. Yue by his side pulls the hem of his clothes while frowning from the smell of the liquor.



[No, its bad manners to not taste liquor thats open…. are you looking down on the liquor?]



Hajime replies as they’re worrying.



A smile slightly appeared on the mouth of the master from the joke. Hajime thought, I got the master to smile! There must not be a lot of adventurers who respect the taste of liquor very often.



Hajime, [ah~] Kaori and the rest let out a voice as Hajime began drinking the liquor with horrible smell. Rather than pouring it into a cup he’s drinking it directly. Hajime’s mind seems to be calm but deep within, “*same problem as above for this sentence*see i am a drinking master, i’ve definitely lived up to your expectations.” As the mini-Hajime explains in the mind, his left arm begins to ache.



Only the sound of [gokyu~ gokyu~] was heard echoing within the store from his throat. And, in no time at all the whole bottle was drunk up in one go.



An empty bottle was held in Hajimes hand! When he puts it on the counter, the master looked at him while having a smile on his lips. Hajime’s eyes conveyed [Any complaints?] towards the master.



[…..I get it, i get it. You are definitely a customer]



The master put up both hands and showed will of surrendering while smiling wryly. Its quite bitter sweet. Hajime’s, “act with a master to gather information was finished” with that he was content with the outcome.



The liquor that Hajime drank was said to be 95 percent alcohol. [could it even be called a drink anymore?] the level of its quality was the worst as well. Its the feeling being treated to free alcohol.



They needed to prove themselves that they weren’t just kids in order to get the master to have a different opinion of them.



By the way, Hajime has a constitution which will never get drunk no matter how much he drinks. The reason is because of “Poison Tolerance.” Originally the delicious way of drinking liquor was instilled to him by his father while in Japan, though it was one of his best memories, its become impossible for him to get drunk completely because of “poison tolerance”, so Hajime regretted for a moment.



[…..De? Is there any information on my question a little while ago? Of course I will pay a suitable value for it]



[No, I don’t mind the same amount as the drinking money a while ago. …..You wanted to hear about the Hauria Usagininzoku right?]



[! …..There seems to be some information. Give me the details]



Apparently, the master actually had suitable information on the matter.



There seemed to have been a huge arrest several days ago, that time there was a group of Usagininzoku who tried to escape the empire soldiers through force. However, it wasn’t possible and they were soon completely surrounded by over 100 empire soldiers, It appears that they were taken to the castle when caught.



Still, the ability to overturn the common sense of the Usagininzoku was an excellent topic, due to the unusualness of the topic there was actually a lot of information throughout the town.



[Hee~, the castle…..]



When Hajime sees Shia by his side muttering, he notices that her complexion has become cloudy. Really, what kind of treatment will a demi-human receive if they invade the Imperial capital….at the very least we can’t expect a bright future.



However, the place he was taken makes me anxious. Though there’s also demand for male Usagininzoku, but males of middle age like Cam doesn’t have very high demand. Moreover, the existence of these excessive empire soldiers practically showing off their power. It would be natural if he was executed immediately on the spot.



In other words, the empire finds some value in Cam, they’ve decided to make the best use of him. The possibility of Cam being alive is still very high. It’s still too early to give up hope.



Hajime clenches Shia’s hand under the counter in order to reassure her. Yue also does the same for her other hand. Hajime and Yue’s feelings were transmitted to Shia, power returned to her eyes and she nodded.



The master looks at Shia’s hair-color which is rare for demi-humans. The relation of the Usagininzoku that was caught could be guessed. Hajime suddenly asked an unexpected question to the master in a light tone.



[Master, if i paid the price, the Imperial castle, would you give me information on it?]



[! …..Though your question sounds like a joke…..It doesn’t seem like a joke when i look at your appearance….]



Though Hajime was smiling, the eyes that looked straight at the master wasn’t laughing at all.



Due to the strange pressure, even masters expression stiffened up a little. The content of the question is tricky as well, If answered unskillfully, the intention of aiding a rebellion will appear.



Mostly, because the adventurers guild is an independent organization, so there is no actual reason to have a “rebellion” in the empire. Hajime, having based his assumption of this, asked his question and put the master in a bind.



However, though the master is someone that belongs to the adventurers guild, it’s also his home country, if it’s known that he sold information on the castles stronghold, he wont get away scott free, therefore he cannot easily pass on that information. Because Hajime was starting to understand what the master was thinking he started applying pressure which caused the master to hesitate even more.



So, the master finally decided on telling Hajime of someone else who knew of the information to his question.



[……There is a man by the name of Nedeiru in the fourth unit of the patrol group. He’s a former jailer]



[Nedeiru. Alright, i’ll visit him. We’re indebted to you, master]



Because Hajime didn’t think that master would tell information about the imperial castle to him, the next best thing would be telling him of someone else who knew.



Hajime left the adventurers guild and walked out onto the main street. Meanwhile, Shia asked Hajime about the exchanges from a while ago.



[Ano, Hajime-san. Being introduced to a former jailer person a little while ago, by any chance….]



[Ah. In order to hear about the details of the place, i intend to invade it tonight. Now then, Yue and I will go and collect information, you guys go off and eat a meal at a suitable place. We’ll be back in two or three hours]



Shia’s face changed to doubt after hearing Hajime’s instructions.



[? Why is it only you two? ….Ha!? Surely, your not just trying to get some time alone with Yue!? Always! Always!!]



[Na!? Is that so Hajime-san!? No, that’s no good! Just what are you thinking in this situation!]



[Mu? Its always only Yue~. ….hey, husband. May i participate in the battle too?]



[Th, there’s no way that would happen! How are we going to do that with the amount of people here. I’m not a guy who can’t read the air]



With the suspicion of Shia and Kaori who sensitively reacts to it, and, to Teio that demands a 3P, Hajime instinctively threw out a tsukkomi.



Kui~Kui~ Hajime’s sleeve was pulled. It was Yue with blushed cheeks glancing upwards at Hajime.



[…..We’re doing it outside?]



[No, because we’re not doing it]



[…..Then, we’re doing it indoors?]



[No, its not a problem of where we do it. Please just leave it there]



[…..Muu, i understand. I’ll prepare for the battle at night]



[The battle at night, you’re talking about the invasion of the Imperial castle right? that’s what you mean right?]



Yue’s joke is clear. …..It must be a joke. Though her eyes had a sharpness to them which resembles a wild wolf about to prance on its prey with a bewitching atmosphere.



On the other hand, Shizuku who had been watching the exchanges of Hajime was considerably confused.



[O, How mature! It should be a conversation between classmates, but its a mature topic *slightly improvised*, what do we do Shizuku!]



[….Afterall what can i do. ….But, Kaori still? …..What should i do? should I be supporting my best friend here? Or should I scold them while its not too late? ….I don’t understand. The level of the conversation is too high for me!]



With Suzu who was blushing and hiding herself behind Shizuku while squirming to keep the ero inside, and Shizuku was muttering things, [Are you Okan ka!*Probably a refference to something*] I tsukkomied. The hero was blushing slightly and the muscle for brains and passbyers A-B-C- through Z was affected by Yue’s bewitching atmosphere.



[You guys stop it already…..The reason why its just Yue and me is because if Nedeiru isn’t obedient, a politer “talk” will be needed, Yue who’s accustomed to Reproduction magic will be useful…..]



[Even i can use Reproduction magic…..]



[Kaori, you should leave it to Yue this time.]



[Shizuku-yan…..]



Nedeiru was a soldier of the Empire, he wouldn’t obediently give information about the Imperial castle. In other words “Force” will be used through questioning. And, Reprodction magic would be useful in order to use “Force” properly, its too severe for Kaori, Shizuku who guessed Hajime’s intentions calms Kaori down.



Kaori also, she had guessed Hajime’s intentions, “still” she wanted to be with him, she also wanted be of help to Shia, but because she understands that the soldier will likely not give information unless force was used she withdrew reluctantly.



Every member consented and while Hajime and Yue started disappearing into the crowd, Shia shouts out.



[Hajime-san! Yue-san! Ehtto, sono…..]



She doesn’t appear to have the right words yet, a troubled smile appears on Hajime’s face when he saw that Shia was stumbling with words. Surely, It was the same serious atmosphere she has in the labyrinths.



After all, Shia said the words with a smile and slightly embarrassed to Hajime.



[Keep H to a moderate level!]



[Its ruined! This damned rabbit!]



After Hajime shouted back, he grabbed Yue’s hand and disappeared into the crowd.



Several hours later, they returned to where Shia and the group was on standby, Yue was strangely glossy and Hajime was haggard. What exactly did they find out…..





Chapter 114




Imperial Capital of the Hoelscher Empire. In the corner of the restaurant on the first floor of the Inn, cold air flowed slightly.



Sitting down at the table where the cold air was being generated, was of course Hajime’s group. After Hajime and Yue returned from gathering information, the females glared cold gazes at Hajime.



Especially, Shia and Kaori’s eyes which were lacking all light, honestly, it was enough to make Hajime feel terror. Just behind Kaori, a Hannya*you know, that demon with the mask and long hair* started becoming visible.



[You seem to have had a great time?]



[Yue, is very glossy? What were you doing? Nee? What did you do? Nee, Nee]



There were no intonations in the voices from the two, the people from the next table couldn’t endure any longer and also quickly left. Judging from the appearance of the two people, It wasn’t possible to intervene at all, the waitress could only give Hajime a troubled look from afar.



The reason why this happened, was naturally, due to Yue being strangely glossy after returning, also because Hajime looked slightly haggard as well.



In other words, although they went out to gather information, what else could the 2 have done other than that! Their anger was building up



[……You’ve misunderstood. Yue is glossy because she sucked my blood?]



[ [ N? ] ]



both of them were misunderstanding Hajime’s situation and were shocked when the truth was told. Due to unexpected answer, both of their faces became identically goofy looking.



[Did you guys really think I’d place my hands on Yue? Am I a dog in heat. Is that what you guys think? Eh?]



[Ah, ahahahahaha, of course not~, I knew it right away. I thought that would be the case. Ne, Nee, Kaori-san]



[Ye, yes! Of course, Shia. The amount of mana consumption from using Reproduction magic is harsh. I thought it was that from the beginning]



Hajime only had a sarcastic look in his eyes, Shia and Kaori’s eyes swam around all over the place while trying to defend themselves.



Hajime, suddenly turns his sights to Shizuku’s group. They immediately looked the other way while beginning to blush. It appears that they also misunderstood completely.



[Ha~a, oh well. Anyways, we got the information that we needed. Tonight, we’ll sneak into the palace where Cam and the others are most likely being held. Though security seems to be quite severe, as long as Cam’s group is found, we can quickly escape using space magic, so it shouldn’t be that difficult. Only Yue, Shia, and I will be infiltrating. Just in case, since you guys can’t use sign perception and teleport. You guys should meet up with Pal’s group outside of the capital. Because we’ll transfer directly there]



[…….We understand……in the first place, is the information is correct? Isn’t it possible that this Nedeiru guy lied……]



[Thats probably not possible. After having his crotch flattened, then regenerating it before he loses consciousness, moreover it was actually crushed….a mans treasure, many times, repeatedly. Its just not possible for a man to endure it…..after we got him to spill out the information, Nedeiru was already shedding tears of relief while holding his hands over his crotch, even I could feel his pain]



Your the one that did it! is what Kouki and them really wanted to Tsukkomi, though they stopped and sighed instead because Hajime was unnaturally showing a sad expression. Shizuku’s thoughts, after having felt chills, it’s a relief that Kaori didn’t go.



At the same time, Yue who grounded up and crushed the man’s crotch many times, thought nothing of it at all, it wouldn’t be odd for them to both be referred to as the “ball smashers” throughout the Empire, Kouki and Ryutaro while shivering, swore to never defy Yue. Their inner thighs became somewhat uncomfortable under the table.



[Na~a, Nagumo……right now, if Shia’s family is in the Imperial castle, shouldn’t you just ask for them back? Riri should be there too, I’m a hero as well…..I think we should manage if we just talk it out…..]



Kouki said, completely late with all the efforts that have already been put in.



Certainly, its as Kouki said, with Kouki’s words as a hero, an appointment for Riria-na could be set up in order to ask for help. Rather than relying just on Hajime’s raw power, negotiations was also a choice.



However,



[And what do they get out of it?]



[Eh?]



[Cam’s group are invaders, what if they’ve already killed Empire soldiers? Moreover, although they completely surrounded the Usagininzoku, Cam’s group became a completely different existence to them because they dealt damage to the Empire. Do you really think that they’d just hand them over for free?]



[That…..]



[They’ll definitely want some sort of compensation. They’ll definitely take complete advantage over it, there’s too much risks. Also consider how they intend to save face as well. Even if they get freed it won’t be over for them. Or, it will likely affect the princess who has to deal with the negotiations. Are you still fine with that?]



The possibility certainly exists, Kouki just kept quiet. Perhaps, he also wanted somehow help with the situation. There was that thing with the Demi-human slave a while back too, he couldn’t ignore it and now continued to think about something.



~Hijiyo~ Hajime started to feel a bad premonition, he looked at Shizuku for an instant. And Shizuku said [Ah, this, this is bad] she noticed Kouki’s expression. Apparently there are signs are recklessness appearing from Kouki.



Hajime’s thoughts, though i never thought it would happen, when we invaded the Imperial capital, Kouki suddenly required “Huge Care” for his actions, I need to take the first move.



[Naa, Amanogawa. I have a request for you…..]



[Tsu!!!? wh….what? a request from Nagumo? …..Impossible…..]



Kouki stiffens up and becomes flabbergasted from the word, request, that Hajime suddenly said. Ryutaro and Suzu also did the same thing. Its as if they had discovered a UMA*Alien* in town by chance. A “request” from Hajime, judging from how he usually is, that word should have been impossible.



However, Hajime had expected that kind of reaction, though he was a little irritated, he didn’t voice it out.



[Ah~, never mind, it’s fine after all. I can’t ask you to do such a dangerous thing. Sorry, forget about it]



[wa, wait, wait a second! First tell me what you want me to do…..]



He started to feel bad due to the atmosphere when Hajime was so quick to give up, Kouki easily took the bait.



[Nothing much, although i’ll be invading the Imperial castle, security is too tight. That’s why I want you to be a decoy to raise the success rate even by a little bit. ….For example, a person that is willing to rage and attract the Empire soldiers for the sake of helping the Demi-humans, like the inumimi boy from a while ago…. something along those lines. Ah, however, its too dangerous. Please forget about it]



Of course, there’s no reason why Hajime wouldn’t be able to invade the castle even if security was strict. Although, a decoy would be helpful, its not particularly necessary. simply, there was no other way but this. It would be bad if he went and did something reckless by himself, so i decided to give him a task to do. At the very least, it’ll actually help! So that he doesn’t try to say that he’s coming along to the Imperial castle…..



[Decoy….those children…..do it. I’ll do it! Nagumo! Please let me be the decoy!]



[O, oh, really, I understand, indeed, you are a hero…..alright. To such a wonderful hero, I’ll give you this]



After saying so, Hajime pulls out some ores from his “Treasure Warehouse” and transmuted them into four masks.



The masks are divided by color, red, blue, yellow, and pink, its a full-faced helmet which makes you think about the heros of a certain crew. It was an ingenious design that didn’t obstruct breathing or sight. An average Synergist wouldn’t be able to create it at all. It was a useless skill that had been refined in vain without waste.



[…..Nagumo…..that’s?]



[As you can see, a mask]



[……………….Why?]



[Why you say, is it alright to have a hero raging around in the Imperial capital? Your identity would be known. Therefore, the mask’s purpose is to hide your identity. In every country, the hero’s identity must never be known. It begins with a masked hero, and it ends with a masked hero. I even color coated it so that you guys could tell each other apart]



[Eh? No, suddenly, with that kind of reasoning…..well, As for our true identities, we should definitely conceal it. We’ll probably trouble Riri if found out….but, this……]



Kouki looks at the masks with a cramped cheek.



[……..Don’t worry about it hero(laughs). To you, the tidy leader, I’ll give you “Red”]



[……Naa, just now, did you attach something at the end of hero?]



[Sakagami*Ryutaro*, you’re blue. Blue shows a calm disposition. Though I hesitated to create a black and make you it instead, my judgement for you(Muscle for Brains) was that blue would be best. I think it was a good decision if I do say so myself]



[O, oh? Though I don’t really understand, you’re giving it to me]



[And Taniguchi*Suzu*, you…..]



[P, pink right? right? I’m a little embarrassed……]



[You’re yellow. Eh? did you hear? You’re yellow. You’re easily happy, so your Yellow. In various meanings, you’re Yellow]



[…..Nee, Nagumo-kun, by any chance do you hate Suzu*she refers to herself this way if you guys haven’t caught on yet*? That kind of thing?]



[And the last one is…..Yaegashi*Shizuku*……]



[Please wait, Nagumo-kun. Though there’s only one remaining….but it can’t be right?]



[Yaegashi, of course, the remaining pink, it’s yours]



[I don’t want it! In the first place, Isn’t there other ways to hide a person’s identity rather than wearing masks? It should be fine if I just cover up myself with a cloth! Nagumo-kun, you, truthfully you’re only doing it for fun right!]



To Shizuku’s protest, Hajime feeling relieved, shrugs his shoulders. Shizuku’s cheeks have cramped up and are twitching because his attitude was unreasonable like a childs.



[Alright? Surely you can hide your identity! But. The mask fits on comfortably, it won’t fall off easily, and it’s shock absorbent. In addition, it’s so light you won’t even notice its on, and its endurance is so high that average attacks wouldn’t even scratch it]



[All, all those things in a single moment……what uselessly high skills……]



[And Yaegashi, you’re the cool beauty type and usually well defined, but in truth, you actually like cute things, its a classic. Therefore, I purposely and thoughtfully made you pink even if you said no. Show some gratitude]



[J, Just what are you assuming….wa, cute things, I, I don’t particularly…..]



[Ah, you’re right, Hajime-kun! Shizuku’s room is filled with stuffed animals]



While Shizuku was desperately trying to deny Hajime’s assumption, a betrayal emerged. Kaori exposed Shizuku’s hobbies. On Shizuku’s head, “!?”, mark appeared.



[……..Thinking about it, she always loved animals back in the days. Especially, rabbits and cats.]



[ ! ]



[Ah, the standby photo on Shizuku’s phone was also a bunny rabbit ne~]



[ ! ]



[Whenever we pass by the arcade, she always makes sure to play the UFO catcher game. Moreover, it’s usually delicious*is this line supposed to be about her face while playing the game or something?*.]



[ ! ]



[I see, and Shizuku-san would always stare and look at my Usamimi*Rabbit ears*.]



[ ! ! ! ]



[…..Yaegashi. Sa~a, take it. Pink….is yours]



Hajime was quietly holding out the pink mask with gentle eyes. For some reason, all other members also, watched her with a gentle expression. Before anyone was aware, the choice to not wear a mask, disappeared.



[…..What’s up with this, this air……though you guys say that, I, though I don’t really like pink, but? I’ll reluctantly take it, but don’t misunderstand about this alright? Also, is there any person out there that doesn’t like small animals? That’s why, this time only, there’s no other reason….so, stop looking at me with those gentle looking eyes!]



Even as her ears were reddening, Shizuku honestly received the mask.



While trying to deny it desperately and embarrassingly, Shia quietly said, [If it’s Shizuku-san, do you want to touch my Usamimi a little?] an empty effort that destroyed the dere aspect of friendship.



By the way, After Hajime finished pushing the 4 to their positions, he was snarling.



The plan was, if 4 people wearing masks suddenly appear and make a huge commotion in town, their names would exceed the 2 names that the Hauria game to him.



In reality, during the time where he was talking with Pal’s group, it seems that he held a grudge against them for laughing at the names he was called by. Moreover, because their color coated, they won’t be called by their names directly, it’ll be enough agony to make them want to conceal themselves up in a mountain…..



While thinking about how to stop Kouki’s recklessness, the intentions to scheme his revenge also appeared, Yue had a look that was slightly amazed.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Midnight.



There were innumerable rooms fitted with grates and not one light in the darkness existed. The grates were made from special metals, it formed a solid barrier and there were carved magic formations on the ground, as if declaring in silence that they’ll never let the people in the small rooms escape.



There was a nasty smell generated from the filth and blood, it was extremely dirty, even if they couldn’t see properly they could tell.



What is this terrible place, Of course, it was the prison which was purposed to restraining prisoners, it was also considered as the dungeon in the castle of the Hoelscher Empire.



As expected, a jail worthy of the Imperial castle, the quality of the metal ore that was used to create the dungeon was certainly excellent, the magic formations carved on the ground in order to not let any prisoners escape was also excellent.



Any person that attempts to break out, or anyone sneaking in will definitely die, there were also traps engraved onto the walls that seemed to be extremely painful when tripped, but, as long as the aria that releases the trap is not recited properly it’ll be fine, though in the first place, arbitrary actions might have been predicted and sealed off already.



With that, there is no possibility of being able to break into the prison, while being tormented by the putrid smell without even one light, if someone is placed in a cell, an ordinary man would go insane in just a day. Guards are situated in front of the only door leading down from the outside, their replacement schedules are much longer during the night time.



However, despite being one of the worst places, now, for some reason there were many voices heard.



[Oi, how many did you break today?]



[All his fingers, and 2 ribs….You?]



[Hehe, it’s my win. All his fingers and 3 ribs I believe?]



[Ha, only to that extent? I broke 7 ribs and his cheekbones…..and also one of his Usamimi’s]



[Are you serious? Just what did you do? Though they don’t really care how we beat them, they specifically said not to put our hands on their Usamimi’s….]



[Na~Ni*What*, it’s just the usual, who’s the person that you’re working for? because, he never answered my question properly. …..Then he said. “It’s your mother. I’m your new father, so I came to check up on my son.”]



[Uwaa~, I guess, anyone would lose their temper over that….]



[But, those fellows, their Usamimi’s aren’t dropping down at all, maybe they’ve received orders? it might be something like disobeying us**Improvised this line, couldn’t get its true meaning*…..]



[Ah~, they’ll definitely be disposed of. Kekeke, I can’t get enough of this stuff~!]



When I heard them, they were boasting of who inflicted the most damage. Though they didn’t die because the minimum amount of recovery magic was used, to have the courage to talk about it in the middle of the room, the owners of the voices state that their prisoners are all covered in wounds.



Still holding it in and enduring it, the identities of those being joked about was, the Hauria that were caught by the Empire.



They, competing who dealt the most injuries, weren’t particularly out of order. As they’ve already prepared themselves for it.



Since being placed into the dungeon in the castle, they already expect not to live anymore. Were they to be executed, or turned into slaves…..It seems to have been the latter case, because they’ll likely try to commit suicide when an opening shows, as expected, they have no will to live. As they would only be forced to fight against their own family, it would only be a nightmare, so they’ve resolved themselves beforehand.



And, they don’t have any power because, they intend to go out with a bang.



The Empire, because the Hauria’s abilities are too far apart from common sense, they’re suspecting that someone is plotting something behind them.



Moreover, even if that wasn’t true, his Majesty the Emperor likes the Hauria tribe, he seems to want to use them as pawns for his empire army. Battle operations, able to use weapons, and fighting spirit, a method of changing the gentle Hauria, the Hauria tribe was like a treasure box for his Majesty which liked strong people.



The Hauria who suspects as much, until their lives were finally extinguished, will continue to defy the empire. Because their resolutions were already made, it was foolish to waste time torturing them.



By the way, being put in this dungeon covered with wounds, they’re still tortured in the name of questioning in their cells, The hauria tribe still showed a confident smile, most of the empire soldiers that saw their confidence showed fear in their eyes.



[This time, the chief was quite grand as well…..]



[Thats right. ……Naa, while we have the chance, want to have a competition with the chief to see who can handle the most injuries?]



[Oh? Sounds good. Then, my Usamimi’s would be complete]



[No, you, it’ll be a great loss right?]



[No, the chief is starting to sound more and more like boss. ……especially when training recruits…..]



[Ah, just as if the boss was possessed huh. When being verbally abused like that…..its impossible…..]



[Ma~a, if the boss was caught in the first place, normally he’ll try to destroy everything from the inside even when caught!]



[Rather, don’t you get the feeling that the Imperial capital is crying? surely, disappearing from the map.]



[Boss is relentless afterall!]



[Because he’s an ogre!]



[No, he’s the Devil!]



[Then, looks like he’s the Demon Lord]



[Oi, oi, doesn’t that make him sound like the lord of Majinzoku’s. Compared with the boss, the Demon Lord is an insect that can’t even compare. An insect]



[Then……the most devilish inspired malevolent god?]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ Thats it! ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



[……You guys are fairly energetic? This “Beep” guy……It’s been a long time but it seems you guys have gotten much more talkative? Eh~?]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ …..…… ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



The voice that was filled with anger that affected the Hauria sounded out from the dark.



It was a very familiar voice, the Hauria fell silent and froze. Inside the darkness, their breaths became shallow as if they were small animals waiting for a carnivore to pass by.



[Oi, Kora. Why are you guys falling silent for. I’m the Ogre, demon, Satan, malevolent god? right?]



[Hahaha, hey, guys. I, it seems like I’ve finally made it to that point. ……I’ve begun hearing hallucinations at last……]



[Feel relieved, you’re not the only one. …..I’m the same]



[Is that so……you guys too……but that last voice sounded like bosses angry voice……]



[At least allow us to hear the voice of a cute woman before our end]



The voice from the other party that wasn’t there should have been properly heard, but the Hauria treats it as a hallucination in order to escape reality.



To such people, Hajime the owner of the voice, pointed out the reality. Yue that was nearby pulls out a sphere of light, the darkness in the dungeon was completely wiped out. And, the appearance of Hajime was clearly seen inside the Imperial castle.



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [Gee, boss——!!?] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



[Quiet down you idiots]



[……You look energetic?]



[Looks and feels like it, though we’re in pretty bad shape……our worries have faded away though.]



Everyone of the Hauria tribe, while suffering from a extremely cruel injuries, being kept in a dirty prison, though they’re not in the state to stand up, their wild voices raised as if meeting their own clones.



Hajime, Yue, and Shia, the Hauria were amazed.



[Wh, why, is the boss at such a place…..]



[Save the talk for later. First of all, we’ve come to rescue you guys. ……Jeez, although you guys are in tatters up you’re quite spirited. Just how tough are you guys]



[Wa, wawa, obviously, its because we were trained by boss]



[Compared to our training with boss, being tortured by the empire soldiers is practically like playing a game]



[It’s like their thirst for blood wasn’t enough? It was too lukewarm, they were even considerate enough to nurse us]



[Ma~a, bosses thirst for blood, is on the level of where in just one moment there is an illusion of being killed in hundreds of different ways, there’s no helping it]



While coughing ~Gefug Gefuu~ and blood, towards the words that the Hauria were joking around with, an indescribable gaze came from Yue and Hajime, looking at Shia.



When that happened she coughed ~Gohon~ to try and deceive Hajime, the traps in the dungeon were confirmed by the Magic Eye, it was then conveyed to Yue and Shia. And, dismantling the traps quickly began.



The magic trap formations, usually, without the correct aria(Key) it cannot be released. But it was being neutralized through the process of dispersing the magic put into the magic formation by operating it through aria.



Though there is the method of directly destroying the formations as well, however usually, the moment it’s broken, it’ll activate, because there are functions which alarm the other formations that one has been broken, so releasing them all by aria is actually the only way.



However, this method only works for the person that placed the magical powers into the aria. conversely, if the person can directly manipulate magic, it’s possible to dismantle them without allowing them to set off other traps even without a key.



Hajime’s group completely neutralized the Imperial castles dungeon which the Empire is so proud of, the Cells are opened one after another through transmuting from Hajime, all members of the Hauria were also completely recovered through Yue’s Reproduction magic.



[Ha~a, as ridiculous as always huh. For the time being, boss……]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [Thanks for coming to save us!] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



[O. Ma~a, it was for Shia. She was worried. Moreover, I don’t see Cam’s appearance. …..Do you know where he is?]



[About that…..]



One of the Hauria began to speak, apparently Cam is currently being interrogated, the position of the interrogation room was also told.



They, by all means, also wanted to rescue their Chief! Though they appealed for it, they weren’t allowed to help out, because they also understood that leaving it to Hajime and them who already invaded this place would be best, believing in Hajime’s words they entrusted it to them.



In the first place, their bodies began shaking intensely because of Hajime’s “Order”…..



Hajime, a metallic plate about the size of his palm was taken out from the “Treasure Warehouse.” It had a lustrous gray shine, there’s a magic formation carved on the handle and the tip was jagged, it was basically shaped like a key.



In front of the confused Hauria, Hajime pours magic into the key type plate, then he pushed it out slowly into the space in front.



Then, the tip of the key type plate pierced through the space in front, a ripple formed and expanded vertically. The ripple gradually grows until it became the size of an adult human being, then Hajime literally twisted the key type plate with a ~guri~ just like a normal key.



Immediately after that, a “hole” extends around the Key type plate, when it fully extended out to a size of an adult human being the Hauria were popeyed, the rock zoned area could be seen on the other side.



[Alright, all of you pass through this. On the other side is the rock zone that’s a little bit to the left of the Imperial capital. Pal and the rest are on standby there]



[Yes Sir! Boss, please take care of the chief]



Though the Hauria were dumbfounded at the lack of common sense that occurred, it was the Ha in Hajime! When they regained their consciousness, it was obviously due to the boss! as soon as they finally understood, they saluted wonderfully. And, they passed through the gate created by the artifact without hesitation, the fellows with Usamimi’s were trained well.



What Hajime took out was, an artifact that produces a gate for super-long distance space transfer.



It was a pair key type artifact, “Gate Key”, and the keyhole artifact, “Gate Hall”, when thrusting out the gate key into space this process was “Opening the Lock”, the gate then connects the space to the place in the gate hall that is set up before hand in order to be transferred to it. Of course, it was created with a combination of space magic and creation magic.



When the Hauria were transferred, the gate is used again to “Lock” the hole in space shut, Hajime and the rest then headed for the place that Cam was being kept.



The severe security was broken through by skills and magic, they quickly reached the location.



The person at watch outside was quickly knocked out silently and they arrived in front of the door, an angry voice could be heard from the inside.



Shia’s expression freezes. She had prepared herself because an injured Cam would likely be on the other side, the feelings of worrying about a tattered family member began to well up.



Its seen, so Hajime put his hand on the doorknob and was about to open it at once, but he stopped instinctively because of the angry voice that came from the other side.



[What, make a firmer fist first! Are you even a soldier of the Empire! Use your hip more, you “Beep” that is only useful to “Beep”! You’re just like a “Beep” thats been “Beep”! A new born kittens fists is better than yours! What happened! Are you mortified, at least break a bone! If you can’t, you’re just “Beep” after all!]



[Sh, shut up! Why do i have to listen to anything you say!]



[Get those hands moving if you have time to move that mouth of yours! Is your hand “Beep” is it your lover, huh? Ah, in the end your lover must also be a “Beep” too huh? You “Beep” and “Beep” are well matched for each other!]



[D, damn you! Natasha is not that kind of woman!]



[St, stop Johann! You shouldn’t do that! This guy will die!]



[Shit, is that fellow there a “Beep” as well. The empire’s soldiers, every single one of them are “Beeps” huh! Or better yet, why don’t you guys just rename yourselves to “Beep”! You pair of “Beep”! You’re both about equal, how about showing some murderous intent!]



[What was that! What did this guy just say! This guy can’t possibly be a Usagininzoku! Somebody answer me!]



[I’ve had enough of this! When I talk with this guy, I feel like I’m going to lose my mind!]



such a shout leaks out from the door and is heard.



Everyone was quiet. While looking down at his own hand that was on the doorknob, he began to doubt himself of this event that went against common sense, the empire soldiers that were supposed to be questioning Cam, were actually being cornered instead.



[Naa, is our help necessary?]



[……lets return?]



[……Say, sorry for now, but please help him. Because I don’t think he’ll be able to leave by himself…..]



Shia yearns for the gentle father of the past, she asked Hajime while looking far-off into the distance. Actually, we would definitely have to help Cam because he doesn’t have the power to get away by himself…..



[Shit, do you know how to do anything besides moving your lips. I am the dark hunting ogre from the wriggling abyss, Cam von fantasy, L F light, the rhode rear, to become the enemies of the Hauria, its still much too early!]*Yeah, this whole line was a huge mess, I don’t really know what i was doing here*



From the other side, something with incredibly bad sense was said.



[……Shia, your father, something amazing was just said]



[……The more you think about it, the more confusing it gets]



[Uu…..does my father have a grudge against me? Trying to kill his own daughter through embarrassment]



Shia was crouched down and covered both her hands over her face. The amount of damage seems to have been serious.



And, as for the condition of serious damage, the interrogators were also the same.



[I’ve already told you, I don’t get it! Damn, I don’t want this anymore! If I have to stay with this madman any longer i’ll go insane! I’m going home!]



[Wait, Johann! What about work! In the first place, what’s with those lines, its sinister so stop it!]



The sound approaching the door could be heard ~Dota Dota~.



Hajime then thought, [As expected, it was too much for them huh~], he then formed a fist in front of the door.



And, the moment that the door is loudly opened, his fist thrusted out.



One of the interrogator’s called Johann, for an instant [Eh?] his face was full of surprise and astonishment, the fist of steel was buried in his face the next second and he was blown back into the room.



Hajime then, steps into the room, fortunately similarly, the other interrogator was stunned as well and in that instant he was also knocked out.



And, the two people that were knocked out instantaneously formed a bad pose with their bodies. Whoever discovers this would have a variety of misunderstandings.



[It can’t be…..is that you….boss?]



[Ahh, what to say, even though you’re in tatters you still abused them with words. …..You’ve become strong, in various amounts of ways…..]



To begin with, it was in the meaning of the 2 that were just blown away a moment ago.



[Ha, hahaha. It seems like I’m not dreaming….O~o, Yue and Shia as well]



For a moment, Cam seems to have thought it was a dream, he replied to Hajime with more power this time, though he’s more tattered than the other Hauria’s were. His intellectual powers haven’t dropped either, he seemed to have immediately guessed that Hajime and them came to help.



[Jeez, I’ve shown you guys a bad appearance even though we’ve finally been reunited. Moreover I was busy abusing the damn empire fellows, I didn’t even notice your presences…..Jeez, it’s shameful]



[……Father, I don’t think it was that kind of problem anymore. You need to quickly get to a hospital. Of course, for the treatment of your head…..in the first place, with those wounds why are you so energetic]



[through willpower?]



[…..Hajime’s demon remodeling….how fearsome]



The constrained Cam was truly embarrassing, he scratched his head with a finger that was broken in a suitable direction towards his head *I’m not actually sure if its with his broken finger or non-broken finger*. His thoughtless answer was tsukkomied by Shia.



Yue who was using Reproduction magic, stared at Hajime rather than Cam with a frightened look. Hajime’s thoughts. Truly frightening, rather than “Sergeant HarOman” was I the pathogen of “chuunibyou”…… *Thanks Endo*



Cam jumps up and down ~Pyon Pyon~ confirming that his body had completely recovered, Hajime then took out the gate key again.



[I’ve already sent off the other guys first. Lets quickly leave]



[Yes, Sir! Ah, boss, about our equipment that was taken away….]



[Ahh? Just leave it, just leave it. With my current transmuting skills I can make more and better equipment than before, so lets just do that]



[I’ll be able to enjoy new equipment? With that, my tension’s shot up, kukuku]



To Cam who was laughing suspiciously, Shia pushed him into the gate and entered together, Hajime and Yue also went into the gate.



After that, the mysterious masked group causing a disturbance in the Imperial capital and the Hauria tribe that was in the Imperial castle both disappeared suddenly, It’s needless to say, the Hoelscher empire was in an uproar until morning.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Extra



At night of the Imperial capital where alarm bells resounded, suddenly, light surges out, at the shack district where Demi-human slaves who are engaged in removing stones are staying and sleeping, the soldier post there was blown away. Apparently it was an attack that was held back greatly, only the building flew, the soldier inside seemed to be safe. Though the majority of them had fainted.



The shadow of 4 people could be seen with the moon shining behind them in a grand manner.



[Who are you guys! Don’t think you’ll get away after defying the Empire!]



The person who looked like the head of the platoon said out angrily towards the shadows.



[Furthermore, furthermore……wearing those funny looking masks! Are you guys fooling around or what!]



[Eh? No, we’re not exactly fooling around…..]



[No matter how you look at it its foolishness! Especially, the pink colored one!]



[ !? ]



[Do you feel that you’re showing off your cuteness or something!? I only feel sick when I see that mask! You damn sex offenders!]



[ !? ……….I didn’t have the intention to show off my cuteness. …….And its not like I like that kind of stuff in the first place…….I was forcefully…..It’s not my fault……]



[Wait a second, don’t mind what the uncle with the ugly face says Shizu…don’t make fun of Pink! Suzu…..Yellow will really get mad!]



[Thats right! Shizu…it’s alright to like pink and cute things! Thats enough, if you hurt Pink anymore, I……Kamen*Mask* Red won’t forgive you!]



[A~, for the time being, Kamen Blue also won’t forgive you~]



As Kamen Pink’s shoulder dejectedly drops, all the other Kamen shout back at the empire soldiers.



The masked groups goal was, to cause an uproar in the Imperial capital, in order to help Hajime’s group to invade the castle easier….Hajime who accurately saw through Shizuku’s facade, in order to stop Kouki from doing reckless things it was unavoidable unless another task was given to him, definitely when they return, she swore in her heart that she would get revenge on him.



While Kamen Pink was being depressed, the heated up empire soldiers suddenly, [Immediately catch those annoying masked guys!] and attacked. However, although they aren’t equal to Hajime and his groups power, even still, they were summoned from another world, in other words, cheaters. The ordinary soldiers wouldn’t stand a chance, one after another they were kicked about.



[Damn it all! Those damn masked guys are all too strong!]



[Damn you, Pink~]



[More like, that sword that Red is holding, I get the feeling that I’ve seen it before….]



The angry groan while laying on the ground was cursed out from the empire soldier. About 3 platoons were already unable to battle. The commander couldn’t endure any longer and shouts out.



[Damn, you fellas, just exactly what is your purpose!]



to the question, Kamen Red stopped and declared loudly.



[I demand that all Demi-humans conditions are improved immediately!]



[……Ha~a?]



[Your speech and behaviors towards Demi-humans are too intolerable! Stop indiscriminately hurting them!]



Towards the impossible request given to the Empire soldiers, [What’s that guy saying?], and they looked at each others expressions. That sounds about right. What Kamen Red and the others saw happening during the daytime, was common sense. Even if they were to suddenly be told to do that, they simply don’t understand.



[Ku, what, the attitude…..it’s just how things are done…..]



[This….Red. The insane ones, it’s unfortunate but it’s probably us. Don’t forget about our other purpose as well]



[I know! But, at the very least just the children….]



[Do you know how many people that is. Do you plan on helping every child that you see? also, it should be almost time. ….Even I’m feeling mortified about this, but, now, lets properly focus on our objective]



[…..Yeah, your right]



Masked Red, withdrew reluctantly in understanding.



[Empire soldiers, Listen here. Our behavior is due to an arbitrary decision. So, the slaves had nothing to do with it so don’t put the blame on them. If, you guys do something like that….]



[Wh, what is it you want to say…..]



[Tonight, behind you when you’re taking a shower, when you’ve woken up and look at of your stomach, in an alley where there shouldn’t be anyone else, under the desk, the gaps through the curtains, the edge of the mirror, in your dreams…..you’ll always see a mask]



The empire soldiers towards the words that Kamen Pink indifferently said without intonations, all swallowed their saliva at once, and thought, [Scary….]. It was certainly a Horror film.



The masked group, after completing their goal said, [To~u!], that kind of feeling and jumped down from the building and into the back alley. And then, the Empire soldiers rushed after them in a panic, but they completely disappeared like phantoms.



Later, among the soldiers of the Empire, [Fear Kamen Pink~that fellow is always looking at you], an urban legend was spread, but that is another story.



Why, because when you’re alone….., the person in the Pink mask breaking down is also another story.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Extra 2



[That is all I have to report!]



[Good work, you may leave]



[Ha]



After the resounding footsteps of the subordinate that left disappeared for a while, Hoelscher Empires Emperor, Gaharudo D. Hoelscher, turned his sights onto the girl who had been talking a while ago.



It was Riria-na S.B. Hairihi, princess of Hairihi Kingdom with a cleansed face, when she noticed Gaharudo’s glance, [It seems to be quite serious?], in a worried voice, a troubled smile was returned. As a princess of the neighboring country, anxiety could be felt due to the report heard just a while ago, however she knew not to interfere because she would only get in the way, such an expression was shown.



[Jeez, I’m troubled. Just after dealing with a ridiculously strong demon some ridiculously strong masked people show up, the strength of those 4 were certainly not a joke…..about this matter, what do you think about it? Princess Riria-na]



[…..I, don’t understand? Still, maybe it was the Majinzoku behind the scenes again? Because an impossible demon was used before, there may also be impossibly talented people as well?]



[yeah, that’s right. ……There’s a possibility of that. For example, one of those guys were able to freely manipulate high level magic with ease, there was even one with a sword that gave off a dazzling light, na?]



[……yes, that’s right. It’s a fearsome thing]



[Ah~, definitely. After being asked what their purpose was they started blabbering about improving the treatment of Demi-humans and their labor conditions, It’s very frightening when its too incomprehensible, is what I think]



[that’s, right]



Riria-na’s expression doesn’t collapse.



Gaharudo was amusingly observing Riria-na, it was an impregnable smile guard. Thats because, rather than a smile pasted on, it was an indispensable royal family secret skill, able to change their smiles depending on the current situation without fail.



However, Gaharudo did not not miss the slight moment where her breath was disturbed.



[By the way, Princess Riria-na]



[Yes?]



[Right now, where is Hero-kun?]



[…..The hero, presently, he’s out traveling. In order to earn experience and power]



[Gee, and here I thought he surely came to the Imperial capital? And, I remember hearing about the emancipation of slaves from someone before as well]



[Oh dear, Emperor Gaharudo about what you’ve just said, have you confused speculation as truth? There’s no way that would have happened right?]



[Hahaha, of course! Speculation without proper grounds cannot be considered a fact]



[Fufufu, yes, thats right]



After a while, [Hahaha], [Fufufu], the laughter of the Emperor and Princess resounded throughout the reception room.



Seemingly, though it looked like Riria-na had confidence, in her heart.



(What are you guys doing! Kouki and co.—!! I mean, why masks!? There should have been many other ways to hide your identities! To begin with, using your sacred sword will obviously reveal your true identity! What a bad prank! Absolutely, it was definitely someone’s prank! And, the only one who would do this is definitely Nagumo-san desu! Why, because of his prank, I the Princess have to deal with this stifling conversation with the Emperor! He always treats me casually too, but unexpectedly the things he does causes a lot of damage. Even though I’m the princess)



is, what she screamed inside. Apparently, Hajime’s masks were made in vain, their true identities were found out by both countries.





Chapter 115




Cam was rescued, Hajime’s group passed through the gate and teleported to where Teio and the other Hauria were standing guard at the rock zone, when they appeared they were greeted with the Hauria’s enthusiastic welcome.



All of the Hauria pat each other on the shoulders, bumped their stomachs with one another, cross countered their arms, and they were all screaming as they were pleased that everyone returned safely.



At that time, Hajime’s ears were filled with the loud shouts of joy which drowned out all the surrounding sounds.



Hajime’s hand rose out with extremely natural movements. A familiar katana in a black sheath was gripped and held out.



[…..What do you plan on doing with that, Yaegashi?]



The identity of the assailant which attacked Hajime with the black katana while still in its sheath was Shizuku Yaegashi. Shizuku’s blade was caught in the fingertips of Hajime’s hand, she clicks her tongue when he wasn’t phased at all even though she’s applying all her strength in the attack.



[……….I’m only relying on Nagumo-kun to relieve some stress. It’s alright, I, believe in Nagumo-kun. Your caliber is deeper than the Mariana trench……so, obediently! Allow me! To hit the octopus!]



[Ah~, Un, you didn’t want to be Pink that much? ……I prepared that with good intentions in mind]



[Thats definitely a lie! I know what your intention was! It was absolutely a prank! Somehow I was pulled into the atmosphere! In a sense, I got what I deserved! —-As so, I can’t help but beat it into you, these feelings! If you’re a man then accept them!]



[Nna, how unreasonable…..]



Apparently Pink has suffered more damage than initially thought.



Certainly, it would have been fine if she declined, it was the natural consequences of being caught up in the atmosphere and accepting the mask. But, even though she understands that, it was obvious that it was Hajime’s speech and behavior which tricked her to be verbally abused by the empire soldiers, Shizuku couldn’t help but snarl.



Most of all, Hajime and Shizuku’s difference in ability is clear, actually, there was no signs of the black sheath which was making a ~Gichi Gichi~ noise overcoming that difference at all. So, reluctantly, Shizuku’s black katana’s ability– she decided to release it. Literally, even Hajime would feel some pain if it was a direct hit, hoping that, she put her trust in it.



[You~! “Run rampant, Thunder flower”!]



[Oh? Oh~h]



However, while gripping the black sword which was discharging electricity, rather than being painful, Hajime’s appearance was that of someone who feels admiration. Shizuku unintentionally shouted out a tsukkomi.



[Wait a sec, Nagumo-kun. Why are you still fine even though electricity is being released?]



[No, it’s nothing much, you should have seen me shoot out railguns numerous times already. I use thunder with my own flesh, there’s no way this degree of electricity would be enough then right? Rather than that, you did well to be able to activate that function.]



[Ku, it can’t be helped then…..I’ll withdraw this time. However, I’ll hit that calm face one day. And also, this was due the results of all the synergists at the Kingdom.]



Shizuku withdrew reluctantly and gave a reasonable answer. Kouki and the rest were popeyed in the back. It appears that they’ve just returned. Shizuku’s unexpected actions caused them to be surprised.



Kaori and Yue just keep staring at Shizuku from somewhere. Then whispered, […..For Shizuku-chan to be snarling….] […..We were too reliant on her], was said, it appears that the two were only having a playful exchange with one another.



[Boss, is this a good time?]



Finally, it seems that Cam’s group was finished celebrating, they came forward towards Hajime. With their serious expressions, Hajime as well, it didn’t seem like it would be a greeting of reuniting again.



Hajime quickly transmuted chairs in a circle and with a glance, conveyed for them to sit down.



[First, although a lot of things happened, putting it simply, it seems we went a little overboard……]



was said, when summarizing from when Cam’s story began, it can only be stated that way.



In order to gain more Demi-humans slaves, The soldiers came into the battered Sea of Trees, Cam’s group of Hauria had gained substantial numbers, and defeated them. The empire soldiers seemed to be extremely cautious of their surroundings. Their comrades kept on disappearing outside of the combat zones, and when they were found, their necks showed signs of assassinations.



The group specializing in the assassinations were a mystery, the Empire had no way of confirming their true identities. Then they thought out a plan. It was an encirclement of the Imperial capital. In short, they were inviting their foes.



Cam’s group easily blundered and fell for the trap, but, it could only be said that it was because there was no telling when the empire might set foot into the Sea of Trees.



Or, many Demi-humans were captured and the blood went into their heads as they weren’t able to overlook it, they might have rushed in too quickly when they saw a chance. The empire’s attack burned down the edge of the Sea of Trees and while passing through the fog they were torturing the Demi-human slaves, the unjust methods may have also been the cause.



In the case that Fair Bergens was in its usual state, they would have likely been able to fight while moving in an organised manner, it’s likely that they also knew that it was attacked by demons. Time is of the essence.



It was unthinkable in their miserable state, Cam’s group wasn’t completely calm either.



And, the Empire soldiers were likely the same. After all, the mysterious group carrying out the assassinations caught in the net were none other than the gentle Usagininzoku which would never be accused of fighting. Moreover, It was not the Sea of Trees, they made full use of cooperation to surround an empire soldier and fought equally. Naturally, the lack of common sense caught the higher up’s interests.



As a result,



[We were captured alive, and were interrogated day after day. The other side was mainly interested on how the Hauria tribe had changed so suddenly and where they got their equipment, and, they intended to go to Fair Bergen. It appears that they mistook us as Fair Bergen’s secret force……actually, the whole clan was close to being executed, if our relations were found out it’s likely that it wouldn’t end with just banishment]



The interrogators, asked for the relationship of Fair Bergen and themselves, though it was said various times that they had a rather hostile relationship with them, it was taken as a self-sacrificial action in order to protect their own country. Especially because they had fearless smiles even when his Majesty the Emperor came to watch the interrogations, his eyes shined like a child who found a new toy.



[And? what’s with your excuses for becoming captives? Just hurry and speak of the main subject]



[Pardon me, boss. Then, the main subject, we gathered many more new family members for the Hauria in order to create a new Hauria tribe*I think thats what he means, ????????????????????????????????????*…..With that we picked a war with the empire]



Cam declared with an accomplished sharp look in his eyes, the time for all those around stopped.



Under the illusion, Hajime and excluding everyone in Cam’s Hauria tribe, all movements stopped and became stiff. Whether they haven’t understood yet, or due to the surprise of the idea. Silence filled the surroundings, the cries of insects could be heard in the rock zone during the night.



It was Shia who broke the silence.



[What, what are you talking about, father? Did I hear it wrong? Just now, I was supposed to hear the reason why my family was fighting against the empire……]



[Shia, you didn’t mishear. We hauria tribe, picked a war against the empire. I definitely said that]



[Don’t, don’t, don’t say such foolish things! Just what were you thinking! Certainly, you guys have become strong, but don’t you guys only have around 100 people? Even then to fight the empire? Have you gone mad! Because of the resentment of being robbed of the same race, you’ve become unable to judge properly right!?]



[Shia, thats not it. We’re sane. listen to…..]



[I don’t have to use my Usamimi’s to listen! If its not revenge, you’re just getting full of yourselves then? If so, take up your weapons right now! I’ll be your opponent before you guys fight the empire. Allow me to cut down that extended nose of yours!]



In an excited state, Shia took out Doryukken out of the “Treasure Warehouse”, and one rotation was made with the strong style and a ~Bishi~! Shia pointed it towards Cam’s nose. Her expression was way past recklessness, it was nothing but pure rage at the thought of Cam and the others who had decided on the suicide attack.



Shia’s magic power pours out around her body in a light blue color with physical pressure which overpowered them, it even exceeded the top Hero’s from a different world which would be considered cheats.



Truthfully, this rage of unimaginable power is not something you’d expect from Shia who’s always energetically laughing, Kouki’s group were holding their breaths. However, Cam who had Doryukken pointed at him with enough power to cause the hero’s to flinch, only quietly stared at Shia just like the surface of calm water.



They stare at eachother, or, while holding their breaths everyone was staring at the two, as expected this man moved, it was Hajime. Before anyone was aware, Hajime had already approached Shia from behind, as if Shia was a wild animal he grabbed her fluffy bunny tail to calm her down, suddenly rubbing it was beyond strange.



[Hiyaan~!? Don’t~, that place is no good~! Hajime-Shan*Not a typo*, shtop it~]



Actually, in a different sense it felt better than having her Usamimi’s felt, when her bunny tail was being felt by Hajime it started “feeling good”.



Shia fell onto all fours, started leaking out hot sighs ~Haa Haa~, and stared at Hajime reproachfully. However, her eyes were wet and feverish too, she was only emphasizing her charming figure and nothing else in this situation.



In the intimidating situation, everyone was popeyed because in an instant the atmosphere turned pink. There were also a few in the group that were slouching over too.



Disregarding their surroundings, this time Hajime stroke Shia’s Usamimi’s. Although it wasn’t in an erotic way like before, it was gentle like driving away the pain. Though Shia glared at Hajime reproachfully who started sexually harassing her in the middle of a serious talk, soon it became eyes that seemed pleasant.



[How about it, have you calmed down a bit? Cam’s story isn’t finished yet. It wouldn’t be too late to blow them all away after first hearing everything right?]



[U~……that’s right…..I’m sorry. Too much blood went into my head for a moment. I’m alright now. I’m sorry father]



[What’s bad about worrying about your family? There’s no need to apologise. like-wise, I should have listen to your words as well. …….Thanks for everything recently, I tend to forget those concerns. ……Even so, kukuku]



[Wh, what is it, father, laughing like that….]



[No, I only hope for your happiness above all else. …..You seem to be loved a fair bit by the boss? Un? When will I be able to see my grandchild’s face?]



[Na, gryand, gryandchild*she mispronounces it* you say…..what are you saying, father! We, we haven’t, I…..]



Cam was teasing her, Shia glances upwards at Hajime frequently while her face was bright red-hot. All the Hauria that sees it were smirking greatly. Really, each and every person showed good personalities. Hajime, while thinking of such things, ignored it lightly and asked Cam.



[Cam, though I wouldn’t have believed it, about that talk, you’re not expecting me to participate are you?]



[Haha~, there’s no way I would. Only, the reason this decision was even possible was due to the boss for training us. Therefore, our decision is our own, at least thats what I believe]



Cam denies Hajime’s question while laughing. It appears that they really plan on only doing it by themselves.



However if that happens, the decision couldn’t be anything but recklessness, so they began to worry about the reason that led to such a decision. Shia as well, Cam and them were getting too full of themselves with their power, they were really serious about not going at it for revenge as well, a sorrowful expression is shown.



[Whats the reason?]



[Thats unexpected, do you want to hear it? I thought you weren’t interested though…..]



[If your decisions were thanks to me training you guys, then when you guys do something careless wouldn’t it also reflect back on me? If its just that much, it’s not something I shouldn’t know…..]



Saying so, Hajime glanced at Shia for an instant. Cam guessed what his intent was, his eyes loosened up and joyfully, [I see], with a nod, he begins to speak about the reason.



[As said a little while ago, the Usagininzoku have caught the Emperor’s interest. And its a very strong interest. The empire is a country where people who believes the principle that abilities reign supreme gather, the emperor isn’t free of that saying either. And, their senses of values of weak people are natural according to their principles being ingrained into their characters]



[In other words, you want to say that the Emperor will begin hunting the Usagininzoku for you? Rather than killing you guys, but in order to make you guys his?]



[Affirmative. While I was still being interrogated, the Emperor himself came, “I’ll keep you” he said. Of course, I spat at him on immediately….]



Towards Cam spitting on the Emperor’s face and then verbally abusing him, the Hauria said, [As expected of the Chief!] while getting fired up, Kouki’s group said, [You did that to that Emperor!?] while exposing their surprise.



No one could blame them though. In history, Cam was likely the first person of all races to have spat saliva on the Emperors face. Even Hajime as well, unintentionally raised a voice of admiration, [Ho~o].



[However, it seems to have had an opposite effect. Capturing all of the Usagininzoku and then training them seemed to be interesting, while laughing loudly with an extremely greedy face. When he declared it, his face was quite serious. Once again he’ll advance onto the Sea of Trees, more Usagininzoku will be attacked this time. Also, Fair Bergen hasn’t finished rebuilding yet, they won’t be able to endure another attack. Therefore, it’ll be likely that the Empire will demand all Usagininzokus to be handed over for them to cease their attack….]



[I get it now. If this is handled passively, they’ll literally rob you of all your family……]



[Affirmative. If its so that only the Hauria survive, it’s not that difficult to do. However, because of us, all the the other Usagininzoku will be deprived of their futures….it’s too much]



It seems that it was a bigger problem than initially thought, Cam’s group was cornered situationally.



It was as Cam had said, Just the Hauria surviving wouldn’t be too difficult if they devoted themselves to escaping and guerrilla warfare while making use of the Sea of Trees, But all the other Usagininzoku will be seeing hell. If they cannot answer the Emperors wish of “Strong Usagininzokus”, women, and children will probably be killed rather than being turned into a pet slave.



[But, you can’t really believe that an army of a little over 100 will be enough to stand against the Empire right?]



[Of course. A head-on collision while shouting courageously would be out of the question. We are Usagininzokus, we won’t lose to any other race in terms of stealth operations]



Cam said while smiling from ear to ear. Hajime also guessed his intentions.



[In other words, Assassination?]



[Affirmative. if they bear their fangs at us, the first moment that they’ve relaxed, their necks will fly from a blade in the darkness….In practice, fear and sense of crisis will be planted into those fellows. Always not knowing where attacks are coming from, the Usagininzoku will show their power that only their race can do. We are neither weak nor lower ranked, they’ll realise that we’re a threat that requires absolute resolution of death to attack]



[The Emperors entire clan, don’t you think that there have already been measures placed against assassination?]



[Of course they probably do. However, we’re not aiming for the Emperor’s clan, it’s the humans around their environment. As expected, none of the surrounding humans would have severe defenses. Yesterday, today, the humans who have been intimate, one person, and then another person will disappear. What we can do at the moment is this, I think it’ll be pretty effective. Then finally, it’ll be perfect if they create a policy of noninterference for us]



It was an indescribably unsophisticated plan. However, rather than saying that they’ll assassinate the Emperors clan, they thought of a very realistic idea.



however, thats it, because there’s not enough time to make the Empire feel any kind of threat, It’s more likely that it’ll cause a full-scale retaliation, will the Empire decide to completely annihilate the Usagininzoku, or will they feel threatened and decide to negotiate at a table, it’s obvious which decision would be made. They’re taking part in a very bad gamble.



However it still needs to be done, the Usagininzoku will have a dark future either way. Everyone has an expression which shows that they’ve already prepared themselves.



[….Father…..you all….]



Shia’s shoulders dejectedly drop. Turning the empire soldiers into enemies, the Usagininzokus which just broke out of the dungeon in the Imperial castle which would in other words be called a prison, If the Emperor doesn’t overlook his own interests for his duty to the public, she could also guess what would happen.



The road left for the Usagininzokus, would they be able to dessert all the other families in order for the Hauria to survive, would all members be happy about becoming toys of the Empire, will they risk their lives and fight, there’s only one choice.



[Shia, Don’t make such a face. We won’t run away like before while being looked down on, we’ll eventually overrun them, submitting to them reluctantly would be an ungraceful thing to do…..Now, we’ll fight like this, to be able to have this will, we’re extremely glad]



[But!]



[Shia, to win the right to live, we’ll fight. However, our purpose is not to live. Our purpose is to live with honor as the Hauria. Against any kind of power, if we retreat now, in the end we’ll be the same losers that we were in the past. Only that cannot be permitted]



[Father…..]



[Look forwards, Shia. Don’t look back at us anymore. You should have already decided. When going with boss outside, in order to advance ahead. With that determination, advance forwards]



Cam, not as the chief and not as the leader of the battle group, but as a father, pushed his daughters back. They cannot allow them to stop any further, the others also wished for them to continue advancing forwards.



After being looked with gentle eyes Shia’s expression turns upside down which seemed like she was going to cry, Cam changes his glance to Hajime and nods. he was gesturing for him to take care of his daughter.



Instead of Hajime, Kouki had a silent expressionless face, Indeed, [I’ll do something about it!] he said as he got up despite the atmosphere, Shizuku hit the back of his head with her black katana. It appears that stress has built up, her way of stopping him became extreme unlike her usual self.



When Hajime didn’t show any reactions, Shia looked back at Hajime. However, before Shia opened her mouth, Cam called out in a strong tone for her to stop as he guessed her intentions.



[Shia!]



It was shocking! so much that Shia’s body was shaking.



Cam and them had no intentions of asking for Hajime’s help in the first place. The situation was their own consequence for falling for the Emperors trap. Here, relying on Hajime’s powers and entrusting him with the solution would mean that nothing has changed. As Cam said, this is a fight to carry on the Usagininzokus pride which is on the line.



And, Shia also understood that. She could also only run away before so she understands, Now, there is the pride of being Hajime and Yue’s companion. But, she feels sad that her family has to make a gamble with such bad stakes.



In the end, Shia kept quiet without being able to say anything.



Hajime, glanced at Yue for an instant and scratched his head then sighed. And, as you would expect, Yue’s eyes softened and noded as she understood what he wanted to convey. Hajime smiled a little and calls out to Shia who was looking down.



[Shia]



[Hajime-san….]



Shia’s eyes showed expectations slightly.



[This time there’s no way I can fight]



[I….I see. That’s right]



But, the words followed by Hajime caused her to look down again. In the back Kouki is shouting something, disregarding that the electrical current from the black katana caused him to faint when hit from the side, Hajime grabbed Shia’s cheeks which were sunk due to jumping to a hasty conclusion.



[Oi, you, don’t jump to a hasty conclusion. Though I won’t fight, I didn’t say I wouldn’t help did I?]



[Fe?]



To Hajime’s words, a silly reply was given while her cheeks were being stretched. Kam’s group also looked at one another with a bemused expression trying to interpret the meaning of Hajime’s words.



[This matter, the Hauria family must show their strength. You should let the other party know that the Hauria tribe is not an easy opponent. The Demi-human discrimination is common sense in this world, if I fight to protect them, the same situation would begin again when I’m gone. Above all, there is Cam and their wills. Thats why, I will not take one step in this battle]



There Hajime patted Shia’s cheeks and turned his gaze to Cam.



[However, our energetic companion is making this kind of face, if you thought I’ll obediently stay out of this matter, your greatly mistaken?]



[H, however, boss….then, just what….]



To Cam who displayed a deep perplexity, Hajime with a fearless grin declared.



[Cam, and the Hauria tribe. All of this guys odd strategies are hereby rejected. You all directly point your blades at the Emperor’s neck. Grab his hair and drag him down, his relatives, his friends, pin down all of his subordinates in front of him. Suppress the Imperial castle, if help does not come, the Empire would be finished by the end of night! engrave it into their bones that the Hauria tribe can finish them anytime they want! Anywhere in this world, there is no safe place, if you antagonize the Hauria tribe, the neck cutting parade begins, force them to write it into their Empire’s history!]



Silence fills the area. Everyone became drunk of stiffness from Hajime’s spirit. ~Gokuri~ The sound of saliva being swallowed could be heard clearly.



Hajime while glaring at the surroundings, shouted out in an angry voice which could be mistaken as thunder which makes everyone breathless.



[What’s your answer! You “Beep’s”!]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [~!? S, Sir, Yes, Sir!!] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



[I can’t hear you! You maggots plan to go to war like that! In the end are you guys just a group of “Beep’s”!?]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [Sir, No, Sir] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]*There’s one extra bracket now to emphasize their voices lol*



[If you’re not, then prove it! Rather than going after the small fry, go for the King!!]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [Gung Ho! Gung Ho! Gung Ho!] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]*google the phrase if you dont understand*



[With the blade of revenge and the guts that you’ve sharpened, cut down anyone who obstructs you!]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [Behead! Behead! Behead!] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



[I’ll thoroughly prepare you, the lead role belongs to you guys! I won’t permit halfheartedness! Do you understand!]
