The moment the light bursted out, Gaharudo shut his eyes and covered his face with his arms, he wasn’t able to completely block out the surprise attack, although his eyes were shut tight he still couldn’t see temporarily, he also lost his hearing due to the severe ringing in his ears as well.



And, the Hauria assailants couldn’t overlook this golden opportunity.



The Hauria’s dressed in black rushed forwards with exquisite timing and immediately came within the targets bosom while they killed off their presence. Then with one spark from the small jet black sword, a second spark emitted again.



With 2 of their senses taken away from them, the tendons in the officers hands and feet were easily cut without any kind of resistance.



The aides screamed in pain as they fell and laid on the ground.



Immediately, their tongues were torn through by a knife. The purpose was to restrict them from chanting. Several people prostrated themselves in the same manner in various places, bleeding on the ground with the tendons in their hands and feet cut and from their mouths. People who tried to fire off big magics were mercilessly beheaded.



Meanwhile, ~Gin Gin Gin~! the sound of metal clashing resounded out. Surprising it was Gaharudo who had lost his sight and hearing, he was able to slash back at the two Haruia tribe members who killed off their presence to the utmost limit.



The two Haura members which were attacking opened their eyes wide in surprise from this demonstration.



Did he feel their unrest in that instant, taking advantage and with fighting spirit, Gaharudo generated a shock wave by using Quake Legs.



[~!?]



[Ku~!?]



The 2 haruia whose stance was broken instinctively let out a groan. And Gaharudo accurately sliced sideways towards the side of the 2 people as if his eyes and ears weren’t damaged at all.



[Scatter and disperse! “Wind Wall”!]



The two haruia members were pushed aside by the sword’s destructive power as they were just barely able to receive the attack with their small swords, a terrific barrage of arrows were shot at Gaharudo and with the wall of wind which only took 2 words to cast, all of the arrows trajectory was easily averted.



[Shoot out! “Flame Bullet”!]



The magic was once again duplicated. 10 “Flame Bullets” were produced which were stronger than the “Fire Balls” from before. It shot back towards the trajectory at which the arrows had originated from when in contact with the “Wind Wall”.



They shuddered from the abnormal presence of Gaharudo who shout out countless magic with power and speed. The Hauria who had hidden their presence unintentionally leaked out their presences slightly.



Gaharudo’s closed eyelids opened up slightly, although he shouldn’t be able to see yet, his eyes carried the light of a dangerous wild beast. And with a grin! he turned his neck and glanced accurately at the direction where the Hauria were in the darkness. He had felt the presence that leaked out a while ago.



[Oooo~o! Burst out, “Flame Bullet”!]



While turning his back against the Flame Bullets he shot out, Gaharudo rushed straight towards the Hauria in the darkness and chanted once again. Immediately, the flame bullet in the back flew towards the ceiling of the party hall and exploded loudly with a roar.



The Hauria who were on the ceiling providing support with their crossbows, quickly withdrew to evade the flame bullet, but because the flame bullet exploded, it wasn’t possible to completely dodge it due to the heat wave generated that scattered widely. At the very least, the places which were used as scaffolding were collapsing down, in the little time before they manage to reach the next sniping point, support cover has completely ceased.



[Dancing wind! Carry out my will, “Sound of Wind”!]



Gaharudo casted his next magic in that timeframe. Supplementary magic “Sound of Wind” from the wind system. It interferes with the surrounding air and amplifies sound, it’s a magic that allows small sounds in the distance to be heard. His hearing was amplified to megavolume, with the assist of this magic he’ll likely regain his hearing.



Certainly, it could be said that this was the magic version of the skill presence perception when applied. Though I say that, the accuracy decreases because they’re being perceived through hearing only, concentration was required to make sense of what’s heard due to that it’s an unsuitable magic to be used during the proximity of battle. This was a basic magic that scouts and secret agents used for information gathering.



[Raa~aa!!]



[Tsu——!!]



[Kuu~u!]



Along with the yell of fighting spirit, his slashes bent and transformed as if he were using a whip.



While raising out a voice of anguish, Gaharudo deceive his senses by overriding them to feel the presences, the Haruia managed to get through it by cooperating with each other. However, because of “Sound of Wind” their presences were seen though. With each step the Hauria took, they generated a subtle sound in the wind.



With his sight deprived, although the method being used was far from proper “Presence Perception”, with a torrent of blood thirst, courage and ferociousness, Gaharudo moved forwards without hesitation and entrusted his body to the information gathering magic.



This is the Emperor. This is the head of a military nation. The king of warriors who boast that power is everything!



This was what the Hauria’s managed to feel first hand…..



However, everyone had a ghastly smile on their lips that was far from shrinking away. The eyes that pierced through the masks shone ferociously in glare, a heavy thirst for blood surged out from each and everyone of them. If they couldn’t hide their presence, then they’ll just cooperate and bring him down! As if announcing that, the Haruia began to move as if they were all one creature.



[Kukuku, You’re giving off quite the good thirst for blood there! Na~a, Hauria’s!]



The cooperation attack was on the level that wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it exceeded the techniques based on hit and run from all directions pouring in. While fighting back against the peculiar swordsmanship, Gaharudo shouted out happily. It appears that he found out that they were the Hauria tribe long ago.



Even though they heard Gaharudo’s shout, the Haruia were silent. They only singlemindedly released their murderous intent.



[A~a? You guys won’t let out shocked voices!?]



Judging from his words, as expected, only his sense of hearing has recovered a little thanks to the magic. Towards Gaharudo’s shout, the Haruias released especially strong thirst for blood——while Cam was brandishing his two short swords, he replied back while overflowing with murderous intent.



[Those are tasteless words on the battlefield. Survive if you can]



[~! Ha, just what I wanted!]



Sparks danced in the darkness and the sword swings became much more intense like a storm.



However, the blades didn’t reach either bodies. Tens of seconds, several minutes…..the people whose mouths, arms, and legs were cut in a certain places began to have anguished expressions, they prayed for their kings victory while being irritated that no one was rushing in from the outside.



At the same time, they guessed that the assailants from the shadows were Usagininzoku due to seeing as the sparks were produced by the swords, towards that impossible scene and towards the unknown, they were desperately holding in the fear they felt.



Then, at that time, their expectation was betrayed by the situation.



[~!, What the? my body…..]



Gaharudo suddenly began to stagger, his movements rapidly dulled. As if saying, [We were waiting for this!], the Hauria sprang from all directions.



Although Gaharudo somehow managed to resist back, it appears that Gaharudo’s oddness was assumed to happen from the beginning, an arrow shot out with exquisite timing and dug deeply into Gaharudo’s calf.



[Gua!]



Cam wielded his small sword towards Gaharudo who was folding from his knees. While blocking Gaharudo’s sword with one short sword, the other was used to cut through the tendon in his arm, his sword finally dropped to the ground.



Although Gaharudo tried to move instantly with magic, 2 of the Haruia’s blocked his way at that exact moment and wielded their small swords in confirmation of the battle still going on, they destroyed and blew away the magic formation and the artifact that was being concealed. At the same time, the remaining arm and legs tendons were cut.



[Tsu——-]



Severe pain was gushing out, however, Gaharudo didn’t scream out, his body began to incline slowly against his will, and ~Dosha~ it was the sound of his body falling prone on the ground.



The party hall fell silent and no words were emitted. Though a few were physically unable to say anything due to their mouths being forced shut, surely, even if they could open their mouths, none of them would have been able to actually say anything.



The Emperor of the Hoelscher Empire was defeated.



Even if their view was shut by darkness, they could tell. Towards that fact, the shock was so huge it erased everything else from their minds.



One of the Haruia tribe members approached Gaharudo who was still laying on the ground. And for now, gave him medicine to recover his sight and hearing. This was done in order to negotiate about the future.



[Fu~n, a monsters paralysis poisoning was scattered here so that you’d stay in place]



[Damn it, were you aiming for that from the beginning……]



Gaharudo was removed of all magic formations and artifacts that were inscribed onto his clothing. When Cam told him of the reason why his body was acting abnormally after restoring his sight and hearing, he cursed out at him.



Light suddenly poured down over Gaharudo’s head. It was due to one of the Hauria’s equipment which acted as a flashlight. It shined down on Gaharudo as if it was a spotlight.



[Wwwwwwww, what does this mean!? Ttttttt, this!? Nyanyanya, Nyagumo-san!? jjj, just what!!]



[It’s fine, calm down a little princess. Right now is the climax after all]



With the tendons in the hands and feet cut, clothes torn up here and there because of the destruction of the magic formations, the appearance of Gaharudo being illuminated by the light appeared on the ground, with lots of agitation Ririana’s mouth closed and opened while shakingly asking Hajime questions who she assumed was the reason for such an event.



During the attack, although Ririana was besides the crowned prince Bias, Hajime instantaneously retrieved her and returned to his original position. During the Hauria’s strategy execution, Hajime and them all gathered in the corner of the hall so that they don’t become obstructive.



Kouki was frowning grandly as he noticed that many aristocrats were dead. Suzu, Shizuku, and Ryutaro fell silent with a difficult expression. This was the biggest chance of improving the Demi-humans standings, because they understood this they kept silent as the battle was literally deciding the Haruia’s fates, though they still couldn’t fully accept the tragedy that unfolded in front of their presence so easily.



In the first place, there was no other choice but to just watch things happen. If they let out their emotions, [Anymore than this is overdoing it!], they’d be obstructing Cam, at that instant, they would be attacked in the back by a railgun.



Although Ririana was speaking loudly and shakingly in unrest, Hajime had Kouki well within view and consideration. Shizuku was thinking about what to do in the case that that does happen, in another sense, cold sweat appeared more from Hajime’s glances at Kouki than of the Haruia’s massacre.



[Now then, Gaharudo D. Hoelscher. Do you understand why you’re still alive right now?]



[Fu~n, you have demands right? Just say them, I’ll listen]



[……Points deducted. Gaharudo. Know where you stand]



The appearance wasn’t seen but the voice of a man echoed throughout the hall. It’s true identity was Cam.



Although Cam called out to Gaharudo who was on the ground, from Gaharudo’s insolent attitude, after several intervals, he gave out advice in a mechanical voice.



And, the advice didn’t stop at just words.



Suddenly, the spotlight distanced itself from Gaharudo. There, with the tendons in their hands and legs cut just like Gaharudo, it was the appearance of a man whose tongue was torn to seal off chants. An arm extended from outside of the spotlight and was gripping onto the man’s hair and forced him to stand on his knees, in the next instant, the man’s head as if jokingly was easily cut off.



[You bastard!]



[Points deducted]



Gaharudo instinctively raised out an angry voice. The other survivors should have seen it perfectly from where they were at. Breathtaking screams could be heard. However, in a serene voice just like a machine was returned towards Gaharudo’s attitude.



Then, the spotlight once again moved to a different place, and that man was similarly beheaded.



[Vesta! You, getting so carri—-]



[Points deducted]



Was it an aide, the name of the man who was beheaded was called out, Although Gaharudo was cursing out, in return, the indifferent voice sounded out and another man was beheaded.



[…….]



While grinding his teeth tightly he fell silent, Gaharudo’s stared into the darkness with eyes that seemed to be able to kill a person with just a glare. Towards such a Gaharudo, Cam indifferently talked anyways.



[That’s right, understand that your position has reached rock bottom. Judge quickly and choose your words wisely. Right now, the lives of all the people in this hall, depends on your speech and behavior]



Simultaneously with those words, a hand extended from outside of the spotlight and placed a necklace on Gaharudo’s neck before he was aware. It was a thin chain with a bright red jewel attached on the tip.



[This is the “Collar of Oath”. Gaharudo, the oath which you’ll pledge to from your mouth, this artifact will be holding your life as lateral. If it triggers even once, not just you, but anyone else who’s connected with your soul throughout your life will die. If the oath is broken, naturally, you’ll die]



The implied meaning, all humans in the room have been secured, Cam informed him that all others have been forced to wear the same artifact. Gaharudo seemed to have understood and his expression twisted as if he was forced to chew 10,000 bitter worms and insects.



The necklace artifact called “Collar of Oath” that Cam placed onto Gaharudo’s neck, the jewel and ore it was made out of was created through Generation Magic which infused Spirit Magic into it, according to Cam’s words, it has the effect of making sure that the oath that comes out of his mouth stays carried out on a spiritual level.



Specifically, the oath that is said will be directly engraved onto their spirit, if the oath is broken or the “Collar of Oath” is removed, their spirit itself will disappear. Moreover, it even affects the next in line souls, in other words, it affects Gaharudo’s entire clan, similarly they would all die if they don’t wear the “Collar of Oath”. In short, towards every one of the Emperor’s clan, the oath from the artifact will have to be followed throughout all generations to come. (A separate artifact is needed for people who become relatives through marriage)



[An oath….you say?]



[There are 4 contents to the oath. First, the emancipation of all the existing slaves, second, a definite promise of nonaggression and nonintervention with the Sea of Trees, third, prohibiting the enthrallment and persecution of Demi-humans, fourth, make all conditions legal laws. Have you understood? If you understand, say, “I swear it here on behalf of Hoelscher”. After that it’ll activate]



[And if I don’t?]



[The Imperial house ends today, the necks of officers will continue flying until the empire straightens out the situation, afterwards, assassinations would be carried out repeatedly for a long time to come. Until we, the Haruia tribe is annihilated, the Empire’s safety in the night is long lost. Officers of the Empire when coming home will only find the heads of their wife and children]



[Don’t underestimate the Empire. Even if we die, it won’t collapse so easily. An army will definitely be led to invade and attack the Sea of Trees and this time, Fair Bergen will definitely be destroyed. You should already understand. It’s not difficult to navigate through the fog of the Sea of Trees if a slave is used. Although combat is harder, it can easily be done through numbers, there are no problems through smashing the Sea of Trees from the edge inwards. Up until now, the reason why we haven’t crushed Fair Bergen…..]



[Because it would be impossible to harvest if you crushed the field……right?]



[So you do understand. Right now, you’ll still be in time. For example, even if you borrowed that guys power, the skills to bring down the Imperial castle in such short time, and that last battle…..as expected, losing you guys would be regrettable. If you guys don’t want to be slaves then I will give you preferential treatment to be under my direct command as my personal troops?]



[Out of the question. You do not deserve our trust based on your behavior of Demi-humans thus far. That’s why I’ll have you pledge to the “oath”]



[Then, it’s war huh. I will definitely not pledge to the oath]



How about it? Gaharudo was about to say until his lips distorted, Cam was as mechanical as always.



[Is that so? …..Point’s deducted, Gaharudo]



Once again, those words resounded out, what was picked out by the spotlight which poured down was…….



[Let go! Who do you think I am! This impudent bunny beast dares! I’ll massacre you all! I’ll kill every last one of you! One by one, I’ll torture you in front of your families until you die! Even the women, until they break I-egu~e———]



It was crowned prince Bias.



The sounds of the crowned prince’s shout could be heard throughout the place. Immediately following that, without any hesitation, a silver line fluttered and the head of the crowned prince of the Hoelscher empire was easily flung into the air.





Chapter 120




Just like a joke, the head of the next inline Emperor, Bias, was easily flung into the air.



[………..]



[That was the next Emperor. Your successor…..can you bear seeing that, can you bear hearing that, that was quite awful]



[…….I should have already said it. Even if we were all massacred, I won’t be pledging to anything. Be crushed by the fury of the Empire]



[To have that kind of attitude even after your son’s been killed. Ma~a, to begin with, he’s probably never been loved by you. After all, the position of Emperor is decided through ability, that’s why it’s not unusual for relatives to try and murder one another]



It was exactly as Cam said, relatives could gain the position of Emperor by winning a duel. Even if the partner is killed during the duel it wouldn’t be considered a crime.



Gaharudo had many concubines who gave birth besides the queen, Bias himself was a child of a concubine which managed to become Crowned Prince through showing his abilities in duels. It was befitting of their principles, the weak will follow the strong! and there you have it.



Probably because of that, Gaharudo’s expression didn’t change at all. Since the beginning, the standards were either weak or strong, there have been rumors that there were no love for his sons and daughters……there didn’t seem to be any hidden emotions either, so it may very well be true. Rather, the aide from a while ago was the only time he really exposed his anger.



Gaharudo that was snorting towards Cam’s words.



[If you know that it’s useless now then just stop]



[There’s no rush. You won’t pledge no matter what? You’ll continue tormenting the Demi-humans after this? You’ll continue tracking down our Haruia Tribe?]



[How repetitious]



[Is that so…..”Delta 1, this is Alpha 1, do it”]



———Alpha 1, this is Delta 1. Roger



All of the sudden, Cam started saying things which Gaharudo couldn’t comprehend. Though Gaharudo had a questioning expression, in the next moment, he felt and heard the roar of a huge explosion through his belly and the complexion of his face changed.



[-. What was that just now!]



[What, it’s not that much of a big deal. We only blew up the barracks that were watching the slaves]



[Blew up? It can’t be……]



[Fumu, how many people were inside again……anyways several hundreds of soldiers just died. It’s all your fault, Gaharudo]



[You bastards did it!]



[Nope, it was you, Gaharudo. Your decision claimed the lives of those soldiers. And……”Delta 1, this is Alpha 1, do it”]



Once again, Cam muttered things which Gaharudo couldn’t comprehend, Gaharudo immediately called out to him. It was far too bad of a joke that they could remotely detonate explosives from this location.



[Oi! Hauria~!]



However, Gaharudo’s words were in vain, a second roar erupted. Not within the Imperial Castle. A large explosion occurred somewhere in the capital.



Holding back his emotions, Gaharudo asked.



[……Where was that explosion?]



[The hospital]



[Wha, damn you!]



[Be relieved. What blew up was the military’s hospital. The only ones that died were soldiers and their doctors……to begin with, the public hospital, Inns, brothels, residential areas, though lots of people lost their homes and are living in temporary shelters after the Majinzoku’s attack, do you have any request?]



[Don’t go laying your hands on the general public! How far are you going to fall Hauria!]



[…….You guys always persecuted us Demi-humans. You’ve got no right to complain when the positions are turned around……”Delta, do it”]



[Wait~!]



The entire Empire persecuted the Demi-humans, at this point how is the general public not involved? Cam showed a slightly amazed voice. Then, mercilessly gave out the order.



The third explosion was heard, this time Gaharudo was grinding his teeth together as he was convinced that the publics buildings were bombed. But actually it was the drawbridge which allows entry into the Imperial castle. Since there will likely be reports coming from the capital about the explosions, the only route to enter the castle was destroyed.



In addition, Cam’s words were partly a bluff, they never set any bombs in areas that weren’t related to the army. The explosions weren’t caused through remote methods either, a unit of Hauria’s that sneaked into the castle had to manually set them off, due to this they couldn’t set up bombs in many places.



[If you won’t be pledging then we have no other choice. I’ll have to set off every bomb we’ve set up in the capital, you Imperial aristocrats and leaders here will be lending a hand in it. Thousands of people will be accompanying each other to the otherside. It’s not a bad way to end huh?]



What he was saying was definitely terrorist-like. Who the heck taught him……though some glances were focused on the boy in the corner of the hall, the actual person was indifferent.



Towards the merciless demand, Gaharudo couldn’t decide quickly and became silent. Though he was looking through his head for a method of breaking out of the current situation, no bright idea’s came to mind. His expression was sour and breaking out in cold sweat, it showed that he was being cornered.



And despite that Cam didn’t allow him any breathing room at all. Since the reply was slow he gave out orders.



[“Delta, this is Alpha 1…….do-”]



[Wait~!]



Gaharudo called out in a panicking voice. And he slammed his head into the ground several times to calm himself down, looked up with a face as if giving up



[Shi—-, damn it all! I get it! It’s my defeat! I’ll accept your demands! That’s why, stop taking lives indiscriminately through explosions!]



[That’s excellent. Then pledge to the oath]



Even though the demands were accepted, Cam replied indifferently. Gaharudo could only show a bitter smile. And while relaxing his shoulders, he talked to the remaining survivors within the hall.



[Ha~a, damn, I’m sorry you guys. I was done in this time. …..In the Empire strength is everything. These Usagininzoku, the Haura, showed it through “bringing down the Imperial castle”. Holding the lives of people. Hence, “As the representative of Hoelscher! All Demi-human slaves shall be freed! We shall never interfere with the Sea of Trees! Now at this time, the persecution and enslavement of Demi-humans is now prohibited! Those who break these vows shall be severely punished by the Empire! They shall also be enacted as new laws in the Empire!” If you guys have complaints, come to my place! If you can beat me, you can do whatever you want afterwards!]



If you wanted to treat Demi-humans as slaves like always, exterminate all who hold Hoescher’s blood! I’ll take you on! he declared. He really was a man who adhered to the principles that abilities reigned supreme. Of course this judgement does no harm to the Empire besides their loss of relations with the Demi-humans, as expected, losing in a direct battle had quite a huge impact.



[Fumu, you’ve finally answered correctly]



Along with those words, spotlights showed down onto everyone in the Emperor’s clan. The still young and oldest grandchildren who should not have been at the hall had a necklace with a bright red stone on their necks.



[If you don’t want the Hoelscher blood to be exterminated, don’t forget the oath]



[I know]



[The content of the oath will be made public tomorrow, at the very least liberate all the slaves in the capital by the end of tomorrow]



[By tomorrow? Just how many slaves do you think there are in the Empire……]



[Do it]



[You dirty bastard! I just have to do it right, I’ll do it!]



[Free the slaves and send them directly to the Sea of Trees. Gaharudo. You must accompany them to Fair Bergen. And then repeat the oath in front of the elders]



[Alone? Wouldn’t I normally be killed?]



[We’ll return you back safely. If you died, various problems would arise?]



[Haa~, I got it. I’ve had a bad feeling ever since you guys broke out of prison. To think that we’d be pushed this far. ……Na~a, do you have a grudge against me or the Empire, Hajime Nagumo?]



Gaharudo glared at Hajime through the darkness.



However there was no answer from Hajime. While holding Ririana by the neck like a kitten, he was leaning against the wall and yawning. Right now was the Haruia tribe’s time to take the leading role. That’s why, he seemed to take on the stance “I’m only a spectator in this affair”.



There weren’t any lights, even though Gaharudo couldn’t see his appearance, he at least figured that Hajime had no intentions of answering. Gaharudo grandly clicked his tongue.



[Gaharudo, as a warning. We definitely obtained some help from our benefactor who changed us. However, that power had already became ours exclusively. If we wanted to, we could easily search for information and invade the castle at any time. It’s easy to scratch your neck when sleeping. If you don’t make the laws, even without the power of our benefactor our blades could easily cut your neck]



[Exclusive use. I’m quite jealous. To be able to use artifacts even though Demi-humans have no magical powers……]



Gaharudo’s crushed and sour expressions weren’t hard to believe. Because it was impossible for the Demi-humans to stand up against another race without magic, however with the use of artifacts that fact was easily destroyed.



However, it isn’t enough to just say stop it, at best they could only curse out at them. [Jeez, what else could I do!], Gaharudo shouted his feelings towards Hajime.



His army was burning down because of the person who created an artifact which allowed him to fly in the air and travel the distance which should have taken 2 months into just a day and a half, if anyone were to be armed with artifacts of that stature then the Hauria’s claim of being able to invade anywhere and carry out assassinations held lots of credibility.



By the way, what was used this time around was the “Spider-typed Golem Scout”, “Improved Telepathy Stone”, and the “Gate Key”.



The “Spider-type Golem Scout” was the spider that saved Ririana. It was approximately 5 centimeters in length, can go anywhere through remote control with “Transmuting” and “Thread”, the images are sent to the “Crystal Display” through the “Distance Transmitting Stone”, and it can sense magic traps just like the magic eye. It also has paralysis and sleeping poison in its feet, even poison which makes it so that the little sonny doesn’t get up.



After Hajime entered the castle, he scattered and installed countless spider-typed golems everywhere. The reason why Hajime was seemingly distracted while in the castle was because the majority of his concentration was used to operate the golems. It was only a coincidence that he saw and helped Ririana while moving towards an installation point.



And the images that the countless spider-typed surveillance cameras that were set up were being transmitted back to the crystal displays installed at Headquarters, each Hauria force had an operator who communicated through the “Improved Telepathy Stone”, which enabled efficient and precise suppression.



The “Improved Telepathy Stone” was the single and most useful artifact to use against Gaharudo.



The principle was this. Ore’s with the property of “High-Speed Magic Recovery” was created through Creation Magic and added into the magical power tanks which caused them to auto regen, it always added fuel back into it as “Magic Radiation” was being emitted.



And the magic formation needed to activate it was a kind of sliding switch which was placed on it to allow it to smoothly activate on and off. Furthermore, there was a function which responded to the blood and status plate, meaning only the blood of the user would be accepted.



As a result, the Hauria forces were able to cooperate elaborately with Headquarters which was stationed outside of the capital.



Since they can’t actually operate the golems, without Hajime they’d have to manually place the spider-typed surveillance cameras. For that purpose, they infiltrated into the castle and installed the new hidden camera’s for the Haruia. Because the golems were unnecessarily complex, they were made to be hard to spot.



Moreover, the key-typed artifact “Gate Key” held a similar principle, because Hajime set up and concealed the keyhole-typed artifact “Gate Hall” in places, the Hauria are able to invade the castle anytime through opening the gate.



Really, from the Empire’s view, [What else could I do!], was definitely the right state.



To begin with, the magic traps are difficult to disarm without being able to directly manipulate magical power, so the fact is, another invasion would probably never be as smooth as this one.



Hajime and them purposely used Kouki to enter the castle, besides installing the spider-typed golem scouts, they were also to disarm traps that the golems discovered. Hajime and Shia in particular, Yue and Shia had to use the “Presence Severing Stone” to easily hide their presence, Kaori also acted, the magic traps were disarmed without notice before the party began.



For now, though there were artifacts devised to disarm magic traps, Fairglass (a goggle-typed artifact which could detect magic traps) was distributed to the Hauria, however this time they had no time for that. That’s why although they wouldn’t be able to disarm the traps, they could evade them instead.



[Don’t worry about it, Gaharudo. The artifacts only belong to the Haruia and no other Demi-humans. Now that you’ve swore to the oath, it wouldn’t do for us to get full of ourselves and attack the Empire. If that happens, we Hauria will wield our blades against the foolish people of Fair Bergen]



Towards those words, Gaharudo guessed that the Hauria were independent from Fair Bergen, however they single-mindedly interfered in order to save their fellow Demi-humans (although it was actually only for the Usagininzoku).



[Is that so. I get the idea now. That’s why, release us already. An unreasonable request was made to be done by tomorrow. If I don’t act now I probably wouldn’t be able to make it on time]



[……That’s good. We Hauria will always be watching you guys. Don’t even think about forgetting it in your dreams either]



Towards those last words, the spotlights disappeared and silence surrounded the hall. At the same time that his presence perception informed him that the Hauria were withdrawing, Hajime received a transmission.



—-Boss. This is Alpha 1. All troops have withdrawn. For all the help, we cannot thank you enough



—-It was for Shia’s sake. Don’t mind it. Besides, everythings not over yet. Stay cautious. Or rather, what’s up ahead is the true battle. There’s no guarantee that there wouldn’t be an idiot who’ll think “Eliminate the Emperor’s clan”.



—-I’ll take it to heart, boss. Since the beginning, we’ve been resoluted and prepared to fight. This path, is the path that the new Hauria tribe has decided to walk down.



Towards Cam’s words filled with resolution and drive, Hajime’s lips raised up. And he gave them a pure praise.



—-Is that so. If you’re resolute then there’s nothing else for it. To all Hauria tribesmen. You were superb!



Towards the boss who they loved, respected and led them, all Hauria’s Usamimis extended straight up! and after a beat passed by.



In the next moment through the telepathy stone, a grand shout erupted.



—-Oo~OOOOOOOOOOO!!!!



That was the cry of victory. For hundreds of years, they were the losers of losers who continued suffering bitter experiences, it was the cry of delight after finally bringing down a huge enemy for the first time.



Being completely honest, what lays ahead is a sight where it’s prohibited to enslave and persecute Demi-humans, prohibited to interfere with the Sea of Trees, and Demi-humans are protected. Exactly as Hajime said, people who desired Demi-humans as slaves would come and try to eradicate the Emperor’s clan, there’s even a possibility that there’s a hole in the oath which the Empire may use to oppress the Demi-humans again.



That’s exactly why, it was appropriate to say that the Hauria’s battle starts now.



At the very least, the oath was imposed, by now, if the Empire invades the Sea of Trees, the Hauria wouldn’t be able to do anything. With this earned time, the Hauria can save and gather power and numbers, and if necessary acquire high level techniques (Assassination) and guerrilla tactics. That way, even if the Empire is prepared to overcome the Oath, they won’t get what they want so easily.



Right, the point of the strategy right now was to make the people at the top of the Empire wear collars and buy time to allow the Hauria to gather strength to be able to withstand the Empire. As such, certainly, the victor of this fight was unmistakably the Hauria Usagininzoku from the weakest Demi-human species.



[Damn, those guys, I shouldn’t have left them unattended. …..Someone, the lights….a~a, that’s right is anyone there…..tte, kora~a! Hajime Nagumo! You bastard, how long do you plan on pretending! At any rate, you’re uninjured! Do something about this situation!]



Hajime narrowed his eyes as the Hauria’s shout of joy was being communicated, at the same time Shia was embracing and rubbing up on Hajime because of the strategies success, from the other side (even in the darkness Hajime could see Gaharudo’s appearance rolling around) of the darkness, and began to hear Gaharudo’s angry voice.



By the way, the moment that he was embraced by Shia, Ririana who he was holding onto was cast aside without hesitation. Towards the sudden attack which caused the death of her fiance, Ririana could only be stunned, after being treated so by Hajime, with tears in her eyes, [Even though, I’m a Princess~!], while muttering about her constant grief, she crumbled onto the ground like a woman who was deserted by her lover.



[alright, I hear you……]



While embracing Shia with one hand, he took out an ore from the “Treasure Warehouse” which flew up towards the ceiling and emitted light. The light stone that floated towards the ceiling in the darkness caused the hall to brighten up just like daytime when they were brought to the hall.



The party hall became completely visible, “horrifying” was the perfect word for it. There were huge quantities of blood splattered everywhere and countless heads on the ground. Besides the heads on the ground which didn’t have time to say goodbyes, everyone else seemed to be alright, though they were all groaning and crawling on the floor with their tendons in their hands and feet cut.



There were lots of mademoiselles who had toilet accidents due to the fear and pain. The moment when the hall was lit up and the disastrous scene was seen, many lost their consciousness, in a certain sense it was good fortune.



Though some of the courageous mademoiselles were just barely conscious, the moment they saw Shia’s Usamimis, they gave out screams and fainted as the whites in their eyes showed. Even the men who didn’t fear much was frightened when they saw Shia.



It appears that the fear of the Hauria tribe was deeply carved into them.



Within that, Hajime’s group and the Hero’s group was clearly completely unhurt. The people who were fighting until they end were giving them stares full of hatred. It appears that they completely believed that it was a conspiracy.



[Oi, kora, Hajime Nagumo. Quit flirting already and help out. What kind of nerves do you have to be able to admire a woman in this situation, and on top of that an Usagininzoku woman at that]



[Nah, look, Shia’s a weak rabbit after all, the raid from earlier frightened her. She’s so pitiful. Those guys were truly fearsome people. All I could do was protect myself]



While saying those foolish things, Hajime was shivering unnaturally.



Veins appeared on Gaharudo’s forehead. Even the people whose tongues were cut to seal off there chants, while on the ground glared at them cruelly as if stating, [We’ll kill you with glares!]. Kouki and them who had strong nerves even trembled from the gazes.



[How impudent…..in any case, it doesn’t change the fact that you’re unhurt. If you hold no malice against the Empire then, nurse us, being needed by people is good isn’t it*I think this line means this, ????????????????????*?]



[However about that, your subordinates are giving out blood thirst as if saying that the instant they’re healed they’ll attack us……In that case, is it alright if I just finish them off?]



[There’s no way that’s alright! Oi, you guys! Don’t ever lay your hands on that monster over there! Even if he’s just a damn cheeky brat whos always being surrounded by great women and surely started a conspiracy with the Haruia tribe, don’t you dare go waste your lives!]



The surviving subordinate’s eyes distort due to their masters command for them to stay alive with regret. Hajime saw their eyes distorting.



[Look, even if I want to kill you guys, there’s no one here stupid enough to willingly jump into a monster’s jaws. I won’t have it. If we don’t get started soon some people are going to bleed out. I’m begging you, Hajime Nagumo]



[Ma~a, I don’t particularly mind if you guys won’t be coming at me. I’m relying on you, Kaori]



[Un~, leave it to me…..”Sacred Text”!]



Without chanting. Without magic formations. the wave of first-class recovery magic shined immediately after calling out the magic name and rippled throughout the entire party hall. With that the wounded people were healed up instantly.



[Even recovery skills are monster class. ……I can’t take this*I think? ????????*]



Gaharudo complained with a tired expression after he noticed that Kaori’s recovery magic wasn’t normal. Gaharudo’s subordinates were dumbfounded as well to be completely healed in an instant. To be able to immediately cast first-class magic was impossible for the general people so it was natural.



Disregarding the mademoiselles who fainted and didn’t get back up, those who could fight immediately gathered around Gaharudo and they looked towards Hajime with stern and cautioned expressions.



[I’ve already said it, give it up already. If you release blood lust like awhile ago and cause a counterattack we’d all get completely annihilated]



[But your Majesty! These guys clearly guided them in!]



[That’s right! Even the Crowned Prince……we can’t just leave them alone!]



[At this rate the Empire’s pride will fall to the ground!]



Gaharudo’s troublesome subordinates all speak out in sequence.



Even though they felt that Kaori’s recovery magic wasn’t normal, they had not witnessed Hajime’s powers with their own eyes. Moreover, some of them previously saw Kouki and the Emperor’s fight at the Kingdom, because of this they “alternatively” used it as reference.



Above that, the damage that the Hauria caused was massive. After all, they placed a “Curse” on the present Emperor and his clan, although that was largely the reason, it was also because the next-in-term Emperor was beheaded. They couldn’t back down easily.



Towards the subordinates rage, Gaharudo sighed out while gaining drive. For them who groaned and staggered, Gaharudo’s voice filled with dignity turned towards the people within the hall.



[Quit making so much noise! I believe I’ve already said, don’t go dying pointlessly. Got it, that white haired eyepatch wearing fellow is a true flesh and blood monster. Even if we brought out an entire army, he alone would annihilate it, that’s who we’re facing. ……They’re strong, don’t even step on their shadows. I’m not saying we have to follow what that guy says but, as people who adhere to the principle that abilities reign supreme, at least have the ability to judge the opponents strength!]



With an angry and shaking voice, the subordinates and even the aristocrats stiffen up.



[It goes the same for the Hauria tribe. Those guys who should have had the weakest power came and challenged the entire Empire. The reason why we were done in was because we were stupid and weak? I don’t intend to leave things off like this, those guys also probably think the same……but first admit it. We lost. The losers follow the victor. That is the Empire’s rule! Even still, if you have a complaint then let me hear it! Convince me through power, make me follow you! Just like those guys did!]



Gaharudo’s angry voice echoed throughout the party hall. Those who couldn’t stand looked towards him, after the subordinates around Gaharudo hesitated slightly, they hung their heads down before him. Deep within themselves they knew, the one who fought until the final moment was Gaharudo. Gaharudo’s words, more than anything was heavy.



[Un, with this it’s case closed]



Towards Hajime’s satisfied words, everyone turned to look at Hajime with hatred. Those gazes spoke more than words. That is, [You’re one to talk! You God of Plague!].



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Even while hiding their hostility against Hajime and them, the surviving Empire soldiers had to face the reality that they were unable to meaninglessly throw away their lives, Little by little they regain their composure because of Gaharudo.



Although the drawbridge was destroyed empire soldiers began to arrive at the castle and the silent party hall began to become noisy once again, control was quickly brought back from the confusing situation.



Leaders of the survivors were gathered, despite being in the middle of night they were holding an emergency meeting to adhere the oaths. Mid-way in, one of the leaders who wasn’t at the party hall laughed at the foolish contents of the oath……



That moment, the lights in the conference room instantaneously died out, when the lights came back on the horror of a subordinate’s head laying on the table appeared, it was the subordinate of the man who was opposing them. The man could do nothing but nod away while turning pale. The other leaders were reminded of the party and began to tremble. The later talks seemed to have been settled quickly.



While compiling damage reports from every place, the laws for the Demi-humans were rapidly made (the draft prepared by the Hauria). At this point, Gaharudo found out that the Hauria had not laid their hands on the general public.



However, from the fact that none of the general facilities were reported to have been destroyed through explosions, he received a message that it was possible to blow them up at anytime and began to worry substantially because of all the possible bombs planted in their facilities.



And within the middle of the night, soldiers were woken up because of the explosions, their individually owned slaves were guided to the countless temporarily raised tents on the open plot of land from the previous demon turmoil. They immediately began to retrieve the slaves in the next building where slaves were being held.



Naturally, fierce resistance was bound to happen. Just when they were woken up in the middle of night, the owned slaves were being forcefully seized. In particular, the slave association was showing symptoms of becoming bankrupted. Financial compensation was promised to be given at a later time, even though it was a royal command by the Emperor, they weren’t able to easily consent to it.



Nevertheless, it was a direct order from the country, they had no choice but to compromise…..stretching time in between then and now, there were many who folded and whined, roughly all of those people were found beheaded in the morning.



And when the afternoon of the next day came to pass, an abnormal situation with Demi-humans gathered in one place in the capital caused citizens to gather and the announcement from the Empire was announced. About the consent of the oath and the additional laws that were established.



Towards the bluntly reported announcement, the citizens became dumbfounded. That was to be expected. Their familiar and convenient tools were suddenly taken away from them. Moreover, it was forbidden to capture them in the future. The situation was honestly one where they couldn’t comprehend.



Eventually, the obvious and natural complaints began to flow out and it quickly became a large and strong opposition. It was about to become a riot, the Empire soldiers began defending the Demi-human slaves from the people in cold sweat, but it became quiet after the announcement made with exquisite timing.



In other words,



[All actions towards Demi-humans was because an “Oracle” from “Ehto-sama”!]



Furthermore, with the appearance of Kaori who fluttered her silver wings and was shining as she descended down from the sky, Kouki showed the light and appearance of his sacred sword. As a result, the announcement held credibility.



Towards the divine appearance (being produced by Hajime’s artifacts) the citizens all got down on one knee and prayed.



Actually, Kaori was trying hard not to run away as she was blushing in shame, if Kaori felt like it, the silver feathers that were being worshiped by the citizens, [Thank you~], could easily be turned into weapons that decomposed everything, Gaharudo who was at wits end on how to explain the laws and emancipation of slaves was simply proposed, [wouldn’t it be alright if we just use Ehto?], Hajime who was in high spirits was chuckling to himself about how amusing it was that the citizens were so serious……Everyone could surely faint peacefully together.



Obtaining and holding onto “God’s Apostle’s feathers”, reluctantly the slave owners backed down as there was also compensation from the country and the majority of citizens were cheerful. In front of their eyes, several thousands of slave’s shackles were being removed by the soldiers one after the other.



The Demi-humans seemed to have been stunned but accepted it with silence. Being completely honest they weren’t sure about what was happening at the moment. Even if they understood they likely wouldn’t be able to believe it.



Before long, with some time the slave’s shackles were all removed and Kouki who showed natural charisma led the Demi-humans outside of the capital. Along with him was also obviously Gaharudo as well as Hajime and them.



The Demi-humans were stunned as they left the capital, amplifying her voice with physical reinforcement Shia shouted out, [You guys are free~! Return to your homes~!], they finally seemed to realize that they were “liberated” and they all shouted out in joy all at once which caused the ground to shake.



Under the cheerful blue sky, while at the Empire’s outer walls, several thousands of Demi-humans headed towards home. Towards the impossible illusion, tears were falling down and Demi-humans were joyfully patting eachothers shoulders.



Within those, there were many who received cruel physical and mental wounds as well, but they were healed through Reproduction Magic and Spirit Magic. Because even Yue couldn’t accurately erase their memories enmass, she compromised that it was necessary for them to be surrounded by family and friends in the long-term.



There were also many Demi-humans that were transported to many different towns, Hajime and them couldn’t be responsible to heal them. They as well, after returning to the Sea of Trees, have no choice but to allow their minds to be supported by the people around them.



Even still, they’ll be able to once again live in their hometown, they can meet their important people that they were separated from once again…..it was surely suitable to call this event a “Miracle”. Hajime who was looking at the Demi-humans shouting in joy, began thinking about his family in Japan, [Someday I too will……], he muttered inside himself and quietly clenched Yue’s hand who snuggled up closely. The cute lover was as if saying, [It’s alright], gently returned strength into Hajime’s hand.
