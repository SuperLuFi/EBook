Lina pulled the trigger of the particle rifle, and a bundle of neutral particles flew into Vega’s magic shield. However, her rank as commander of the 4th detachment was not just for show: her strength exceeded Deneb’s, and Vega’s barrier withstood the particle beam.

“That’s not all!” Lina shouted.

A moment later, the plasma that had seemingly scattered across the surface shone bright as its temperature shot up from Lina’s special magic Muspelheim.



Usually, this magic only transformed ambient air into high-energy plasma, but this time the plasma particles emitted by the particle rifle were stil scattered in the area. Lina focused her magic on the area around Vega’s ship, increasing power as the affected volume decreased. Vega’s magic barrier collapsed as the area affected by Lina’s magic contacted it. At the same time, Vega and the Star Dust soldiers jumped out of the boat.

A second later, plasma swallowed the vehicle.

The heat from Lina’s magic ignited the hydrogen fuel and the boat went down. Lina sighed with relief as she lowered her weapon, but she still kept her guard up, and her Mirror Shield magic reflected an infrared beam of light – Regulus’s fast-firing, high-energy infrared laser bullet, Laser Sniping. Though the magic had “fast firing” in its title, the nature of the magic caused it to have about a 1 second gap between each shot.



As soon as Lina sensed the laser bullet’s impact, she removed the shield and located Regulus. He was approximately 1 kilometer from the coast on the bow of the catamaran Midway. Once she found him, she restored her shield.

Lina’s Mirror Shield blocked outside electromagnetic waves from getting in – it did not block particles going out and was like a one-way mirror.

Lina shot a beam of neutral particles through the mirror towards the ship.

“Huh?” Lina mumbled a moment after the shot. She had not felt the defeat of Midway after the shot.

Due to its nature, Mirror Shield block visible light coming from the outside, so Lina could not physically see what was going on, but Lina would hear an explosion if it reached the ship or feel psionic vibrations if the beam was stopped by a barrier. Lina quickly moved to a new position with movement magic in order to shoot straight down the laser snipers sights. She removed the mirror shield and looked at the transport ship.

“Zoe?!”

Zoe Spica stood next to Regulus on the prow of the ship. Her right arm was forward, pointing directly at Lina – she was in the process of activating Molecular Divider.

However, this magic was only medium range, and would not reach Lina from 1

kilometer away.

“…clear!”

Lina once again pulled the particle rifle’s trigger, sending a beam of particles forward, but about halfway to the ship, the beam dispersed. The particles ended up scattering without reaching the ship.

“I thought so!” Lina shouted.



Molecular Divider inverts the polarity of electrons, cutting molecular bonds.

The electric field created in a straight line towards the particle beam inverted the

polarity of the electrons present in the beam. This turned the neutral particles into positive particles that repelled each other, dispersing the beam.

Regulus jumped away from Spica as Lina aimed the particle rifle towards him.

He moved forward in zigzags, using the water as a surface to prevent Lina from aiming. If Lina had been able to use Brionac, his attempts at evasion would have been useless – Lina could control Brionac’s plasma even after firing, so it was impossible to evade unless one was moving at a speed faster than Lina could follow. But the particle rifle only sent a beam in a straight line, so advanced rifle shooting skills were necessary – skills Lina did not have.

Lina threw the particle rifle to the side and pulled out a pistol – a gun with an integrated CAD. Weapons with magically increased penetration power had been produced in Japan for a long time, so Lina had asked the CAD development center staff to give her some equipment more similar to the weapons she was used to.

The transport ship began to turn away from the island, but Lina didn’t have the luxury to follow.

◊ ◊ ◊

A light blue car left the parking lot of Aoba clinic in Chofu with Tatsuya behind the wheel. He ignored the rules of the road and opted for flight, lifting off of the road. Minoru watched this occur through a camera in a combat quinoid that had not yet been turned into a Parasite doll.

“And so the mission begins,” Minoru muttered, seemingly talking to himself.

In reality, however, it was not a monologue – Minoru was giving the order to start to the driver of the van, who dropped him off at the curb. The driver was a member of the Kudou family assigned to Minoru.

Minoru transmitted the order to start the other six vans by radio. In total, there were six, including the van Minoru was in. All six had parasite dolls and fighting guinoids in their cargo compartments, and though the vans were currently separated to avoid detection, they were heading towards the same destination – the hospital in which Minami lay.

◊ ◊ ◊

Tatsuya, ignoring the rules of the road and air traffic, flew off the public road directly, but the police did not bother to stop him and no chase was sent. The car, registered as an ordinary car – not an aircraft, had no need to keep the radio channel

for aircraft open. Combined with the fact that police helicopters could not keep up with the air car and the Air Force wasn’t about to send fighters to chase a car that had started flying from the main road, even if a chase had been attempted, it wouldn’t have been successful. In other words, law enforcement agencies had neither the means to deliver the order or stop the pursuit whether they wanted to or not.

The car’s license plate had probably been captured by the street cameras, so there was a chance that trouble would come later, but that was not important at the moment. Besides, Tatsuya still had the claim that the self-defenses forces hadn’t done anything to stop Miyaki Island – Japanese Territory – from being invaded by a foreign military force. Still, Tatsuya didn’t want to use this as justification for legal exemption but as a means for bargaining.

Reaching the coastline, Tatsuya put the car on course to cross Tokyo Bay and the Urag channel in order to avoid flying over land again.

Tatsuya raised the aircar’s speed to 900 kilometers per hours, Tatsuya headed for Miyaki Island.

◊ ◊ ◊

Holding a gun in her right hand and a knife in her left, Lina stood ready, preparing to meet the oncoming Regulus. However, it was not Regulus, but Deneb who attacked first.

“Lina!”

Deneb called out to Lina, shortening her name not because they were close, but because the Parasite’s conversation previously had used Lina’s shortened name to reference her.

“Leila!”

Lina did not freeze from the change in enemy and changed her aim to Deneb who was jumping out of the water, rushing her in a top-down attack. Lina at acked Deneb with the weight magic Hammer, which tracks an enemy and applies pressure to a detected surface. The magic struck at Deneb from her left side, but Deneb softened the blow by using movement magic towards the right.

As this played out, Regulus began to activate Laser Sniping, but instead of activating her Mirror Shield, Lina sent a knife attached to her belt at Regulus. She was using her magic “Dancing Blades” through her thought-controlled CAD, so she didn’t

even need to touch the knife with her hand – it flew out of the holster and rushed to Regulus on its own.

Regulus’s concentration was broken as he was forced to dodge, and the laser bullet flew towards the sky. However, Lina’s attack was still not finished and she controlled the knife behind Regulus to strike the weapon device for Laser Sniping. Regulus threw the broken device with a knife now stuck through its hardware to the side, and as it fell into the water, the device blew up. Regulus quickly grasped the handle on his belt with his right hand and pulled – quickly turning what had been his thin belt into a rapier. The sword was not just sharp - Regulus had also added an electric shock over the entire blade.

Lina didn’t have time to continue her attack on Regulus, as now the weight magic Hammer was being used on her – and it was more powerful than magic she had used.

“Vega!?” Lina shouted.

Weight magic attacks flew at Lina one after another.

“…You are still being familiar?”

Vega still had a grudge against Lina for “betrayal.”

Lina quickly took a step backwards, but Vega followed her movement and went ashore. Holding her pistol and knife, Lina looked towards her left and right.

In front of her was Vega.

To the right, Regulus.

On the left, Deneb.

And behind them, the Star Dust soldiers-turned-Parasites began to come out onto the beach.

Despite Lina’s attempted intervention, the sabotage unit of Stars had successfully made it onto Miyaki Island.

Lina had struggled to fight the three opponents of First-magnitude Star class.

With the addition of twenty Star Dust soldiers, she could not possibly cope alone.

“So, you’re also Parasites now?” Lina spoke.

Lina tried to change the situation by speaking to Vega and Deneb in her native language. Neither bothered to answer Lina, but Deneb raised her eyebrows slightly.

“Now that you are Parasites, surely you know the truth. It wasn’t me who caused the Parasites, and the idea that I have secret connections to Japan is also a false accusation!”

“If you have no connections with Japan, then why did you run here!?”

Deneb didn’t hide her passion as she spoke with anger in response to Lina.

“To escape. From you, the rioters,” Lina answered calmly. Though her heart raged towards Deneb, she suppressed her emotion and gathered her will into a fist.

“Right. Then it was a false accusation,” Vega responded.

Vega’s voice could not be called calm, but it also couldn’t be considered excited – it was more apathetic, and Vega grinned in her response, continuing.

“But now you are helping a Japanese private military organization. As an American soldier, you came out against the States.”

“Japan is a federal state. Planning an act as dishonorable as sabotage to take advantage of the New Soviet Union’s attack is unacceptable,” Lina answered.

“This was the decision made by the Pentagon – not we, simple soldiers fighting on the front line.”

“Wow-wha…”

Lina was surprised momentarily, but quickly accepted it as fact – if the government was willing to use Parasites, they should also have been willing to risk sabotage.

While Vega and Lina had their verbal struggle, the Star Dust soldiers attacked the rest of the defensive squad and slowly continued to move inland. Lina saw this, but could not offer any assistance – if she ignored the three around her, she would instantly die. Lina was trapped.

“Traitor Sirius. It’s good that you were here, because now, caught red-handed in a hostile act towards the States, we can shamelessly get rid of you!” Vega finished.

As soon as Vega finished her statement, Vega, Deneb, and Regulus – three members of Stars with the rank of First-magnitude class now merged with Parasites –

simultaneously attacked Lina.

Deneb breached the peace first as she waved a large knife at Lina and used movement magic to close the distance. Lina reacted with the same magic in the same direction, keeping her distance. Realizing that she couldn’t catch up, Deneb fired her

pistol and Lina once again responded the same way, turning the battle into a shootout over shields.

Regulus followed Deneb, and using self-acceleration magic, he appeared in front of Lina. With his electrified blade, he struck her shield.

Stuck in place, Lina at acked Vega with gravitational magic, but Vega destroyed her gravitational field with Molecular Divider.

…more precisely, Lina’s magic was interrupted because of the inconsistencies between the modification of phenomenon caused by Molecular Divider and Lina’s gravitational magic encountered in the air, and the magics canceled each other out, destroying both Vega and Lina’s magic.

As this was going on, Regulus continued to attack Lina’s shield, and it began to tremble. The electrical surges emitted by Regulus’ blade finally finished off Lina’s barrier, breaking it. Deneb took her opportunity and shot Lina’s left shoulder. While Lina’s armored suit was able to stop the bullet from penetrating, the momentum of the bullet was transferred to her shoulder and the impact caused Lina to involuntarily drop her knife. She instantly activated Muspelheim in defense.

Vega, Deneb, and Regulus all leaped to the side to evade the generated plasma. When it dissipated, in the center of the area previously filled with high-energy plasma, Lina stood breathing heavily.

The three Parasites exchanged looks.

Lina pulled her pistol’s trigger, but penetration magic was not applied to the bullet so Regulus stopped it with a magical barrier, and a Dancing Blade Lina had released earlier in the fight was knocked down by Deneb. Her two attacks stopped, Vega created a repulsive field which threw Lina back.

Lina was thrown down the road running along the cobbled promenade, and she fell onto the rocky surface of cooled lava. Vega, Deneb, and Regulus cautiously approached her, looking down at Lina.

Lina was unable to stand, barely finding the strength to climb onto one knee. Vega punched Lina back down, but despite her weakness, Lina’s fighting strength had not faded. She grinned faintly.

Deneb pointed her pistol at Lina.

Regulus pointed the tip of his sword.

Lina bit her lip with regret.

But at that moment, a light blue car cut threw the air and landed as if it was aimed at the three Parasites.

Vega attacked the car with her repulsive force field, but the magic dispersed before it was completed. Vega rounded her eyes, Regulus and Deneb could hardly believe in their eyes as the aero car landed about 10 meters in front of Deneb. The three had dodged the air car by jumping back to the embankment.

The driver’s door opened, and Tatsuya stepped onto the Miyaki Island battlefield dressed in the Freed Suit.

◊ ◊ ◊

Tatsuya had flown from Chofu to Miyaki Island in 20 minutes. If he had flown at subsonic speed the entire distance, he could have made it in 10, but the flight from Chofu to the sea and over Tokyo Bay required him to go at a slower speed.

Tatsuya knew about the situation on Miyaki Island even before he arrived. He was receiving the data from the island in real time, in addition to monitoring the psion wave oscillations from Lina’s fight. However, there was no magic for teleportation, so Tatsuya could not instantly move from Chofu to Miyaki Island.

Restraining his growing impatience, Tatsuya focused on controlling the aircar.

A camera mounted on its nose caught sight of Miyaki Island, and without slowing down, Tatsuya headed towards the northeast coast that was now a battlefield. He didn’t bother to use the runway at the airport and landed directly on the road running along the embankment where the battle was being fought. As he was landing, he dispersed the magic of an anti-gravity spell that was trying to prevent him from landing.

There were fighters from the defense squad still on the road, so Tatsuya slammed the on the breaks to not hit them. There were also enemies on the road, but Tatsuya didn’t really care – his thought process amounted to “if I hit them with the car, I can save time.” Tatsuya had no doubts about his ability.

Three Parasites fled from the path of the air car by enhancing their jump with movement magic. Tatsuya could tell that they were the Parasites of First-magnitude Star class with only one glance using elemental sight.

Like the rest of Japan, driving was done on the left side of the road on Miyaki Island, but Tatsuya ignored the law and stopped on the right side of the road for his convenience. Lina was barely standing on one knee on the hardened lava next to the road.

“Lina, can you continue?” Tatsuya asked.

He had already checked Lina’s state by looking, but still asked the insensitive question.

“I can,” Lina responded, not wanting to hold Tatsuya back.

With the last of her strength, Lina rose to her feet. She looked as if she was trying to stand during an earthquake, but she somehow managed to stay up.

“I will figure this out. Cover me.”

Without waiting for Lina’s answer, Tatsuya turned towards the three Parasites who were now on the embankment. This was probably for the best, as Tatsuya’s cold voice made her shiver all over her body as goosebumps formed on her back. She wouldn’t have been able to answer even if Tatsuya had waited.

Vega used magic to push Tatsuya back with his car, but the magic was demolished before the sequence had even been fixed on the Eidos of the target. Tatsuya had released a dense flow of psions from his whole body to vanquish the spell.

“Gram Demolition?!” Vega and Deneb cried out simultaneously.

Tatsuya raised his right hand. There was no gun-shaped CAD in his hand – he just pointed his finger and activated Mist Dispersion with the fully thought-controlled CAD built into his suit. The activation time was almost zero.

He erased the magic suppression zone almost instantly.

He tore down the Data Fortification magic around the Parasites so quickly that it could not be perceived.

He cut the intermolecular bonds of Regulus’ tissues in essentially no time.

The man named Regulus had been completely erased, and all that remained of the Parasite was its true body. Now Tatsuya reached out with his other hand and shot Armor Piercing Psion Bullet. He wasn’t aiming at the Parasite that had recently been in Regulus and instead shot at Vega.

Vega, struck in her chest by a dense shell of psions, fell backwards and violently convulsed. Rolling down the embankment in that state, she fell back into the sea.

In the blink of an eye, Regulus had been deleted and Vega thrown from the battlefield. Deneb was frozen in shock as Tatsuya sent another Armor Piercing Psion Bullet at Deneb. She fell back.

Deneb was not the only one frozen in place – Lina lifted her helmet flap and stared, dazed, at Deneb writhing on the road. She could hardly believe her eyes – Tatsuya had instantly neutralized these three whom she had been at her limit fighting against.

“Lina, look after this woman,” Tatsuya told Lina.

He realized she was in shock and that she would now overestimate his combat power because of a misunderstanding. Tatsuya had only been able to neutralize the Parasites so quickly because of surprise, but he didn’t have time to explain himself. The true body of the Parasite in Regulus had appeared, and it began its activity as an intangible life form as it searched for a new host. The real battle was now beginning.

Tatsuya concentrated psions inside his body before releasing them into the Parasite. He attacked from all six sides – front, back, left, right, top, and bottom.

The Parasite attempted to push back against the psionic currents, but realized it was impossible and tried to escape by moving away. However, pressure was being applied from the front, back, left, and right, and the top and bottom sides were closed tightly.

Surrounded by walls, the Parasite created a shell in an attempt to protect is pushionic information body, but the walls quickly ate into the shell, penetrating it. Trapped, the Parasite shrunk and hardened, mixing with the walls.

Tatsuya’s psionic currents continued to converge, concentrating a progressively smaller area. Finally, all the Psions were compressed into a sphere with a 3-centimeter diameter. The sphere hung intangibly about 10 centimeters above the concrete embankment.

Tatsuya had sealed the Parasite that was recently Regulus in his Sealing Sphere.

◊ ◊ ◊

Miyuki and Minami followed the instructions Tatsuya gave right before he left and returned to Minami’s ward. Miyuki read while sitting on the single couch while Minami continued preparing for her exams, sitting on the bed which had been raised to support a sitting position.

Miyuki, turning the electronic pages of her book, suddenly looked up.

“…he was pretty quick. Have our guards already discovered them?” Miyuki said.

“…Miyuki-sama?” Minami asked, confused.

Minami turned to Miyuki and asked for her to clarify, but Miyuki’s words had mostly been her muttering to herself.

“Minami-chan, he is here.”

Still, Miyuki didn’t ignore Minami’s question.

“Who… really?!”

Minami closed her textbook program and turned off her terminal as she got out of bed.

She was not in pajamas, however, so she wasn’t panicking about having to change her clothes.

“Yes,” Miyuki said while nodding.

Miyuki didn’t answer with the name of who had arrived because Minami had of course figured it out: it could only be Minoru.

Miyuki called the security intercom, and Yuuka appeared on the small screen of the terminal.

“Miyuki-san, the company has arrived.”

Before Miyuki could speak, Yuuka explained the situation that she had already figured out.

“I feel signs of Parasites from six directions,” Miyuki responded.

“…So you already knew. The sensors are saying the same thing.”

Miyuki was so ahead of ordinary magicians in her magical perception that she seemed to be at a different stage of evolution. Yuuka’s surprise was based on this prejudiced notion, but Miyuki smiled broadly after hearing Yuuka’s astonished voice.

“Shouldn’t you expect this from the next head-sama?” Miyuki said, teasing Yuuka.

“In that case, perhaps you also know where Kudou Minoru is now?” Yuuka asked, moving on.

“The response from Minoru is quite blurry. It seems he is disguising himself by both Parade and Ghost Walker.”

Miyuki’s words made it seem like trying to detect him was pointless, but her tone contrasted this and Miyuki continued trying to find Minoru.

“I don’t feel Minrou-kun’s signs from other groups, so he’s probably inside a car or other vehicle approaching from the northeast,” Miyuki explained.

“A car from the northeast? Alright, I’ll pass this information to the Juumonji family then.”

“Thank you.”

“Miyuki-san, please do not leave the ward. Even if he gets into the hospital, we’ll figure this out,” Yuuka warned.

“I understand.”

“…Then I’ve said everything. Until next time.”

Yuuka was slightly suspicious of Miyuki’s quick agreement with the situation, but she didn’t ask Miyuki about it.



When the intercom went down, Miyuki sighed a little.

“…Onii-sama will not have time to return,” Miyuki assessed.

Miyuki was dissatisfied with the situation but held no grudge against Tatsuya for having left the defense against Minoru’s attack.

◊ ◊ ◊

Minoru got out of the van about 200 meters from the hospital. There were tall building all around, so he could only see the highest floor of Aoba Clinic.

At the same time as Minoru, 6 Parasite dolls left the back of the van. The other cars held the same load. In total, Minoru had prepared a fighting force of 36 parasite dolls

– 15 already made in the former Ninth Laboratory, and 21 made by Minoru using the dummies in the factory in Ikoma.

The base bodies (dummies) for the Parasite dolls were gynoids originally made for military use, but these dolls were dressed in casual clothes. They each was ankle-length pants combined with various blouses, T-shirts, and summer sweaters.



Since it was daytime, pedestrians were walking around. There weren’t as many out as usual because of the New Soviet Union’s invasion, but some people still went out for urgent errands. By giving the Parasite dolls casual clothes, the dolls could blend in with passers-by without giving off the feeling that something was wrong.

Contrary to the goal of blending in, however, Minoru didn’t bother to hide his appearance at all with magic so his beauty stood out like a sore thumb. Pedestrians passing by even stopped to stare at him as if he had descended from heaven. Minoru couldn’t even walk to a hospital without attracting attention.

Suddenly, Minoru stopped.

The crowd also stopped.

Minoru spoke, looking at the big young man who blocked his way.

“Juumonji-san, could you let me pass?” Minoru asked.

“I didn’t think you’d appear at this time,” Juumonji responded, ignoring Minoru’s request.

“I’m not a vampire, so I don’t have to wait until night,” Minoru answered jokingly.

“You are not an ordinary vampire, but I wouldn’t say that the description doesn’t fit.

Vampires suck the blood of people and turn good into bad – at least, that’s how it is in fantastic stories, but you are real,” Katsuto said with a serious face.

“It’s a shame you think that. I’m not attacking people who accidentally stopped me on my way,” Minoru said.

“But now you are trying to turn one girl into something inhuman.”

Minoru and Katsuto’s conversation took place in front of pedestrians walking by on the street, but none of them really understood what was going on through the metaphor the conversation was using. Some of the passerby were whispering phrases like “what is this, a movie shoot?”, but these were the minority. Most felt that the conversation was real and not just a figment of some story.

“Juumonji-san. Let me pass.” Minoru made his request again, this time more forcefully.

“Kudou Minoru. You are under arrest.”

This time Katsuto answered, but his answer more than just denied it.

“What charges?”

“Unauthorized transportation of military weapons on public vehicles.”

While Katsuto was speaking, a detective behind him hidden in civilian clothes and working under the Juumonji family appeared with a police warrant.

After Katsuto’s words about weapons and the appearance of the police, unrest appeared in the crowd of passerby.

“Are you talking about the Parasite dolls? Well, you caught me, but can you fight in a place with civilians?”

Minoru provoked Katsuto.

“So you plan to involve the civilians in this?!”

Katsuto created a barrier to lock Minoru in front of him as he was talking. However, Minoru switched places with one of the Parasite dolls behind him at the same time – it wasn’t teleportation but Parade he had kept active through the conversation with Katsuto.



Minoru used stun magic on the detective, but the Katsuto defended his subordinate with barrier magic. To do this, however, he had to release the barrier around the Parasite doll that Minoru had swapped places with, and this doll attacked Katsuto.

Katsuto’s barrier collided with the doll’s barrier, giving off sparks of psionic light.

This Parasite doll specialized in anti-object barrier magic.

Like Parasites, Parasite dolls tended to specialize in specific magic. Though they had a lack of diversity, they were able to demonstrate powerful abilities in their field to such an extent that the doll specializing in barrier magic could resist against Katsuto.

Still, this was not enough to make it a fight on equal footing. Katsuto was forced to take his focus away from Minoru, but as soon as he became serious, he destroyed the barrier around the Parasite doll and crushed her mechanical body, being careful to not completely destroy the doll – he knew that death of the physical body of the Parasite releases the true body, and it was safe to assume that it worked the same for Parasites in machines as for Parasites in humans. Still, Katsuto couldn’t leave the doll in serviceable condition, so he destroyed the head and limbs, leaving only the electronic brain and fuel cell of the gynoid.



Until this point, everything had been within Katsuto’s expectations, but what happened next went beyond. The Parasite doll exploded.

The explosion itself was blocked by Katsuto’s shield, but the destruction of the body meant that the Parasite had been released.

This was not the only exploding doll – other parasite dolls attacked other magicians of the Juumonji family standing in Minoru’s way, and the Juumonji family could not ignore them. To stop Minoru, the Juumonji magicians hurried to neutralize the dolls.

And each of the neutralized dolls exploded.

Many Parasites were released, searching for new bodies. The non-material life forms attacked the Juumonji family as well as nearby civilians and people hiding in buildings.

Katsuto and his subordinates were forced to protect the civilians from the Parasites.

They didn’t have time to chase Minoru.

◊ ◊ ◊

After erasing Regulus’ physical body and locking the released Parasite into a Sealing Sphere, Tatsuya did the same with Deneb. Two completed Sealing Spheres hovered about 10 centimeters above the ground, and they would remain for about 12

more hours in their current state without outside interference. Further processing of the seal should be performed by specialists, so Tatsuya left the spheres to be dealt with later. During his flight to Miyaki Island, Tatsuya had asked Hanabishi Hyogo to send a magician with sealing skills, and Tatsuya had no doubt that Hyogo would find someone who could finish the job.

“Lina, I am leaving this place to you. Don’t let anyone get close to the Sealing Spheres.”

Lina was fascinated by Tatsuya’s actions in dealing with the Parasites so efficiently, but she came to herself when he assigned her a task.

“Sealing Spheres? Are you talking about these things?” Lina asked.

“Yes.”

Tatsuya replied to Lina without even looking before jumping onto the jetty. Lina only saw the back of his helmet and couldn’t see his expression, but she somehow got the feeling that he had smacked his tongue.

Tatsuya ran east of the embankment chasing Vega who had fallen into the water. After being hit by Tatsuya’s Armor Piercing Psion Bullet, Vega revealed the true nature of the Parasites.

Without bothering to breathe, Vega tried to swim underwater in an arc towards the east coast of the island. Still standing on the embankment, Tatsuya targeted Vega with Mist Dispersion. As if it were a survival instinct, Vega suddenly surfaced.

Tatsuya detected an increased number of psions as this happened – meaning Vega was beginning a counterattack.

When Vega had became a Parasite, her rate of activation drastically increased. Now, with her true nature fully manifested, the speed increased even further, but.

Vega’s magic was not yet completed.

The magic she was in the process of building was dispelled.

The magic that protected her body was destroyed.

And then her physical body was erased.

The substances that made of the body of Charlotte Vega were divided into individual molecules. Once the body was deleted, the molecules dispersed – some remained in in their form, other were used in chemical reactions or dissolved in seawater.

Until this point, everything had gone according to Tatsuya’s expectations, but at this point he miscalculated.

The true body of the Parasite was not exposed. The body appeared after erasing the physical body it had merged with, so Tatsuya could “see” the psionic envelope covering the Parasite, but he couldn’t analyze the information body – its core. He could only feel its existence, and the Parasite drifted underwater.

This contracted the current hypothesis about the true form of the Parasites – the current belief was that the Parasite would relentlessly seek out a human body to stabilize its existence. Initially not belonging in the physical world, the Parasite was believed to be drawn to strong thoughts and emotions from people. This theory assumed that after the disappearance of the host, the Parasite would give the highest priority to search of a source of psions to stabilize itself in this world, which allowed the creation of Parasite dolls. Therefore, Tatsuya didn’t expect the Parasite to move away from potential sources of stability.

“Is it… afraid?”

Parasite’s were also a life form, so their behavior could be an instinct for self-preservation. The Parasite might just be frightened and trying to escape, but it was fairly difficult to be certain of that.

“…no, it doesn’t matter right now,” Tatsuya convinced himself.

The invasion of Miyaki Island was not over. The strongest 3 parasites had been defeated, but more than 10 were still fighting the defense squad. Tatsuya was also concerned about hurrying back to the hospital to take care of Minoru – he was convinced that the invasion of Miyaki Island was a diversion to get him away. Though he knew Miyuki was not the subject of the approaching danger, he didn’t want to take any risks and wanted to get back to Chofu as quickly as he could.

“…do I make it right there?”

The psions were intangible particles and could only interfere or be interfered with by structurally organized nerve cells – non-systematic magic is just as effective underwater as in the air.

While Tatsuya was thinking, the Parasite that had recently been Vega began to move towards the sea, trying to escape from Tatsuya. Tatsuya instantly released a mass of psions in the sea.

The mass released towards the Parasite overtook it and flew in front, destroying almost half of its psionic sheath and core. Tatsuya sensed that its thickness had halved.

Tatsuya applied Sealing Sphere to the Parasite that had been Vega.

◊ ◊ ◊

Still in Minami’s ward, Miyuki felt the true bodies of the Parasites appear near the hospital. She quickly turned on the intercom and called Yuuka again.

“Yuuka-san.”

“What?” Yuuka answered.

Yuuka’s voice was somewhat agitated.

“The true bodies of the Parasites have been released,” Miyuki said.

“…understood.”

“At this rate, civilians will suffer. Yuuka-san, please take your subordinates and seal the Parasites outside,” Miyuki ordered.

“But there will be no protection inside the hospital,” Yuuka protested.

“If ordinary people become victims, the anti-magic movement will rise again – and we have finally calmed it down with peaceful magic projects.”

“But…”

“If the enemy gets inside, I’ll think of something,” Miyuki reassured Yuuka.

“…fine. I understand,” Yuuka responded.

On the small display, Yuuka nodded reluctantly.

“You're right, Miyuki-san. I will seal the Parasites first so the city dwellers do not suffer. I will leave the hospital to you for now.”

“I will try to hold out until you return, Yuuka-san,” Miyuki said modestly.

But despite Miyuki’s modest words, Yuuka understood that she did not see Minoru as a threat.

◊ ◊ ◊



Focusing his magic on remaining hidden, Minoru made his way toward the main entrance of the hospital without being detected. He was joined there by four Parasite dolls who had made it past the Juumonji guards. Suddenly, about 10

magicians ran out of the hospital.

Minoru intuitively understood that the Yotsuba would be the hospital’s last line of defense, so he carefully directed his magical perception inside the hospital. He only used passive detection, not wanting to risk detection by using psions to actively search.

“Only Miyuki-san is left…?”

Miyuki was not hiding her presence, so he was able to detect her with passive detection. Minoru had expected only Tatsuya to leave the hospital, and Miyuki staying with Minami was within his expectations. He had seen some of her abilities in Nara, but he was not naïve enough to think that that had been Miyuki’s full strength.

“Still, compared to Tatsuya-san…”

…she should not be such a strong opponent. Based on the current situation, Minoru assessed his chances of a successful invasion.



The hospital doors remained open as if inviting Minoru in, and there were no more signs that someone would come out of them. The Yotsuba magicians were directing all their attention toward the released Parasites.

Minoru had not wanted to take the civilians hostage. He wished the Yotsuba luck in sealing the Parasites while he penetrated the hospital, concealing both himself and the Parasite dolls with his magic.

◊ ◊ ◊



The Tsukuba branch of the Yotsuba family specialized in mental interference magic, and among the people led by Yuuka, eight people had mastered methods of mental defense. These eight surrounded Yuuka, forming a circle (or more accurately, and octagon) with Yuuka in the center.

These eight people separated themselves by a regular distance and turned to face away from Yuuka.

The magician Northwest of Yuuka said “Ken.”

The magician in the West continued: “Da.”

The magicians to the Southwest, South, and Southeast of Yuuka followed in their order:

“Kon.”

“Ri.”

“Son.”

To the East and Northeast:

“Sin.”

“Gon.”

And finally, the magician in the North finished with:

“Kan.”

A barrier from mental interference magic appeared from using the ancient magic of the “Eight Trigrams”: Sky, Water, Earth, Wind, Thunder, Mountain, and Water.

Yuuka was spot on the center of the barrier.

The barrier was not just a barrier to defend against mental interference magic: it was an altar that both protected the spellcasters inside and increased the effectiveness of the magic from these spellcasters.

Yuuka took out a small piece of paper from her purse. It was cut to have a square center, square protrusions on the left and right, and a triangular protrusion on its top.

The bottom was cut into two rectangles connected by the top. It was an amulet formed to be a paper doll, abstractly symbolizing a person. Yuuka placed the amulet between the index and middle fingers of her left hand, holding it to her face.





Yuuka managed the bracelet-CAD on her left wrist with her right hand to cast her magic. A sequence of magic was projected from Yuuka to the amulet doll, and the amulet jumped out from Yuuka’s hand after the sequence of magic to fly towards a Parasite. It quickly sucked in the information body core of the Parasite, sealing it inside.

The amulet trembled, dancing in the wind before falling back down into the octagonal barrier formed from Mental Interference magic.

Yuuka quickly pulled out another amulet, but the Parasites were able to sense danger and attacked Yuuka with lighting magic.

But the physical magic was stopped by Katsuto.

“Ara, thank you,” Yuuka said.

“The Juumonji family will protect you. Tsukuba-san, focus on sealing,” Katsuto responded.

Katsuto and Yuuka had met a few days ago, so without wasting time on additional greetings, they each continued to perform their jobs in order to deal with the released Parasites.

Tatsuya took the Sealing Sphere hovering over the surface of the sea and returned to Lina. The battle between the defense detachment and the Parasites from Star Dust was ongoing, but the situation was fairly stable and Tatsuya didn’t need to hurry to help. If Tatsuya and Lina joined the fighting, it would end in less than 5

minutes.

“…or would it be better to finish it all at once?”

While Tatsuya pondered this, a small armored car drove up the road leading from the airfield. The door opened and Hanabishi Hyogo stepped out of the driver’s seat.

“Tatsuya-sama, sorry for making you wait.”

“No… Hyogo-san, you are just in time,” Tatsuya replied while raising the helmet flap of his Freed Suit.

After greeting Hyogo, Tatsuya looked at the back of the armored car – Hyogo should have come with the spellcaster requested by him to seal the Parasites.

The rear right door of the armored car opened, and the person who stepped out turned out to be a girl younger than Tatsuya dressed in a bright dress unsuitable for the battlefield.

“Ayako?”

Tatsuya’s voice expressed his surprise.

There were 2 types of Yotsuba magicians: magicians with high aptitude for mental interference, and magicians with powerful and unique magic. Tatsuya and Ayako were both of the second type, unsuitable for using mental interference magic, but it should have been necessary to seal the Parasites.

“Hello, Tatsuya-san. Hey, Fumiya! Tatsuya-san is waiting. Hurry up and come out faster!”

Ayako’s words after her greeting instantly dispelled the doubts. Fumiya’s special magic “Direct Pain” used mental interference magic, and after he had been forced to retreat from Minoru, he had learned a sealing spell for the Parasites from the main house.

Fumiya, moving slowly for some reason, finally emerged from the armored car.

However, Tatsuya did not immediately know how to greet him.

“Fumiya… that is, Yami?”

“Call me Yami, please…”

With a face the same color as his shirt (that is, red), Fumiya answered Tatsuya with a timid voice.

“I see… Yami, what is with this appearance?”

“I’ve already said I don’t like it!”

Fumiya replied in an angry, dissatisfied, and almost tearful voice.

“Nothing can be done because it’s necessary for the sealing spell.”

Ayako’s voice was tinged with detachment – she had already been forced to deal with plenty of complaints from Fumiya.

“Needed… for sealing?”

Tatsuya turned to Ayako as he asked his question. He was short on time, but he couldn’t help but ask.

“It seems that more than 5 spellcasters are needed to use the original magic for sealing the Parasites.”

Ayako said this as both a response to Tatsuya and encouragement for Fumiya.

“But our staff is currently located in Tokyo, so we have a shortage of people,” Ayako continued.

“I see. So Fumiya came alone?”

Fumiya was the heir to the Kuroba branch of the Yotsuba family. He was initially supposed to help his father take the command of the Kuroba magicians, so the fact that he was sent to Miyaki Island showed how much his magical power was appreciated as a candidate for the head of the Yotsuba.

Still, based on only this, it was still unclear why Fumiya was dressed as he was.

“Apparently certain types of ancient magic have an increased effect when wearing clothes of the opposite sex.”

Dressing as the opposite sex – a woman in male clothes, or a man in female clothes.

“So now we have Yami in the form of a temple priestess?”

“Yes.”

Fumiya’s clothing consisted of a white kimono top and a red hakama shit bottom. He wore sandals over white socks, and his wig was square like the one he usually used, but had long, straight hair tied behind his back.

No matter how you looked at it, he was a beautiful priestess-san.

“Yes. The head-sama said that since there are not enough people, I have to strengthen my magic like this,” Fumiya said, somewhat dejectedly.

“Then… I offer my condolences.”

Tatsuya was unwittingly serious as he apologized to Fumiya. He had sent a request for a sealing wizard, but his request had resulted in Fumiya becoming a toy in Maya’s hands.

“…no, Tatsuya-niisan, you aren’t guilty. Besides, I’m just doing my job!”

Fumiya absolved Tatsuya’s guilt while encouraging himself. It was clear from his appearance that he hoped to complete the sealing as quickly as possible to be freed from this cosplay sooner.

“I see. Then seal these three first,” Tatsuya said.

It was necessary to preserve Fumiya’s motivation, at least for the start, so Tatsuya had him start with the weakened ones. Tatsuya showed him to the spheres in which the Parasites that had once merged with Regulus, Vega, and Deneb were locked.

“Tatsuya-san… did you do this?” Ayako asked.

Both Ayako and Fumiya stared at the Sealing Spheres curiously.

“But they look pretty sealed…?”

Tatsuya shook his head at Fumiya’s question.

“After about 6 hours, the effect of these Sealing Spheres will disappear. It is also inconvenient to store and transport them like this.

“Indeed… well, I understand.”

Fumiya went back to the back-left door of the armored car and came back with a wooden box which looked like a first aid kit. Inside were 16 Kokeshi dolls without painted faces. The armored car also held two more boxes just like the first.

Fumiya took one Kokeshi doll out of the box.

Ayako pulled a red mat out of a gym bag and spread it over the road.

“I am starting.”

Fumiya placed the Kokeshi doll in front of the Sealing Sphere, sat on the mat, and stretched his hand to his CAD – a long and narrow mobile terminal attacked to his belt.

Tatsuya and Lina carefully stepped away from the twins.

“Tatsuya…”

Lina turned towards Tatsuya and spoke in a depressed voice. Tatsuya silently looked toward her and asked her to continue.

“And Fumiya…?”

For a while after her escape, Lina lived under the Kuroba family’s protection, so she was already acquainted with Fumiya.

“…because he wants to change clothes quickly?”

“Let’s hurry and neutralize the parasites still in the battle so Fumiya can seal them quickly,” Tatsuya responded.

There were still 20 Parasites. Tatsuya replied to Lina with unconcealed pity on his face, and the tense atmosphere was finally becoming calmer with Fumiya’s appearance.

However, the tense voice Tatsuya heard from his communication device smashed his ease to pieces.

◊ ◊ ◊

Minoru and the Parasite dolls who had infiltrated Aoba Clinic climbed to the 4th floor using the stairs to get to Minami’s ward. Nobody had tried to stop Minoru during his trip from the entrance to the stairs, or while he climbed the stairs to the fourth floor corridor. He hadn’t even seen any signs of being noticed.

“…is this a trap?”

Minoru found it hard to believe that there weren’t precautions in place against Minoru, and he hadn’t seen any patients or other hospital staff either. But if it was a trap, where was it? Minoru couldn’t think of anything that could stop him.

Minoru only detected the presence of Miyuki and Minami inside Minami’s ward, so it seemed to him like they were just telling him to come in and pick up Minami. Minoru was suspicious, but also a little relieved at the situation.

…premonition.

Minoru felt a slight pang of worry for a moment, and the steps felt heavy after it. The Parasite dolls had no feelings about the now sinister atmosphere, but they also slowed down after Minoru decelerated.

Minoru and the dolls took almost 3 times longer than they should have to get to the chamber. However, there was no indication that we was being attacked from within –

his worries seemed for naught.

Minoru took a deep breath and ordered one of the Parasite dolls to enter. Opening the unlocked door, the doll entered the chamber. A moment later, Minoru glimpsed a sparkling white ice field.

“I am standing in a lifeless, icy world of absolute silence.”

This illusion was pressed on Minoru’s mind with such force that his heart felt ready to stop – so much that it took him much longer than it should have to notice that the Parasite doll entering the ward had stopped.

The Parasite was not just frozen physically.

The Parasite’s true body – the difference between the fighting gynoids and the parasite dolls – had also stopped. The spiritual life form was frozen.

As if thrown back, the Parasite doll returned to the corridor and crashed into the opposite wall of the door. It fell to the floor of corridor. Minoru didn’t know if the electronic brain inside the gynoid had been frozen, preventing body control, but it was clear that the Parasite doll was out of action.

The door to the chamber remained open, but Minoru did not feel an invitation to enter. However, there were no signs that someone would leave, so he would only seal his fate by waiting – either Tatsuya or the magicians from the guard could return.

Minoru didn’t have much confidence that the Parasites on Miyaki Island would delay Tatsuya for long, and the chance of them defeating him was zero. Minoru’s main enemy was time, and he ordered the remaining three Parasite dolls to enter. Then, focusing all his strength into Parade and Ghost Walker, he followed.

As he entered, he heard a whisper:

“Cocytus.”

Minoru once again felt the lifeless, silent world of ice. The illusion of Parade was frozen; Ghost Walker was useless. If Parade had not protected Minoru, he intuitively knew that his body… no, his very soul would have frozen. The Parasite dolls, without any such protection, fell onto the floor without any sign of external damage.

When the vessels shaped like women became ordinary lifeless dolls, Minoru found himself facing Miyuki – he was frozen, and Miyuki calm.

Miyuki did not move.

Minoru could not move.

Miyuki was the first to speak.

“What an eyesore,” Miyuki said as she waved her right hand. The Parasite dolls that had fallen to the floor were pushed into the corner of the room.

“What was that, just now…?” Minoru asked, moaning. He was clearly not asking about the movement magic Miyuki had used to move the dolls. Miyuki also understood this and answered the real question.

“Cocytus: magic to freeze the mind. My trump card.”

Miyuki’s answer was cold, but it contained no hostility.

“Magic to freeze the mind…?” Minoru muttered, stunned. He couldn’t quite believe the events that had taken place as he entered the room, and his question was really asking “what does this mean?!”, but Miyuki didn’t answer that question.

“Minoru-kun. This is your miscalculation.”

“Miscalculation?”

“You thought I was weaker than Tatsuya-sama, right?”

“……”

Minoru had no answer.

“I am weaker than Tatsuya-sama.”

Minoru unwittingly swallowed saliva. He was not frozen anymore by his shock after Miyuki’s magic, but by the tension her words brought.

“However, I am the natural enemy for the parasites. Jobs such as these… I am better suited for,” Miyuki said. The last of her friendless remaining in her tone disappeared as she said her next words.

“I can kill the true body of the Parasite.”

The Parasites were a spiritual life form and could not resist against Cocytus.

“Magic that freezes the mind… magic that freezes it to death?” Minoru asked.

“Cocytus is the magic that stops the mind.”

Physically, it is impossible to achieve absolute zero – heat transfers from higher heat to lower heat, so as a substance approaches absolute zero, heat can no long be removed. However, Miyuki’s magic Cocytus could completely freeze the mind, and once frozen, the mind could never again be set in motion.

“Mental absolute zero…?” Minoru asked, still struggling to accept the events.

“A mind without material connections – without a physical body – cannot hold its information body and will eventually disappear… it will eventually just cease to exist.”

“……”

Once again, Minoru was at a loss of words. Miyuki was telling the truth – Minoru was forced to admit he had miscalculated. Leading Tatsuya away was not enough –

when planning a diversion, it was more important to lead Miyuki away.

“Minoru-kun. Please get out of here.”

“Huh?!”

Minoru was not the only one surprised at this suggestion. Minami, next to Miyuki watching the conversation unfold, could not hide her surprise.

“Your capture… it’s the work of Tatsuya-sama. It is enough for me to just protect Minami-chan.”

“……”

“Run away Minoru-kun. I will not chase you.”

Even without giving a proper purpose, Minoru was sure Miyuki was telling the truth.

If he retreated, he would be able to escape, and Minoru found himself considering the act, however cowardly. However…

“…I cannot.”

Minoru couldn’t accept Miyuki’s offer.

“I came here to help Minami-san. I can not retreat for my own benefit.”

Minoru realized he was being foolish, but he was not sure if he would get another opportunity to “save” Minami.

“…perhaps this is the last chance…”

“…if I run away now, I will no longer be able to reach Minami…”

Minoru’s reasoning didn’t allow him to make a wise choice.

“… I see. I’m sorry.”

Miyuki held her right hand towards Minoru. Cocytus did not need a gesture; she was giving Minoru the chance to change his mind, trying to push him through intimidation. She was not worried about Minoru attacking in response – she had

sensed her previous Cocytus had effected Minoru, so his magical abilities were temporarily deteriorated.

But Minoru still didn’t run away.

All of Miyuki’s emotions disappeared from her face, and she stood with her arm extended. But right before she activated Cocytus, Minami shouted.

“Please stop!”

Minami called for Miyuki to stop and ran to Minoru, covering him as she spread her arms to the side. She got in Miyuki’s way to defend Minoru.

“Minami chan, what are you…” Miyuki mumbled and astonished but she quickly recovered.

She did not try to persuade Minami – Minami herself didn’t understand why she was doing what she was doing.

…also, it wasn’t clear how Minoru would act.

Miyuki started to activate Cocytus, but she was forced to ask Minami to stop instead.

“Minami-chan, don’t do that!”

Minami was trying to activate her barrier magic.

“Miyuki-sama, please! Stop!”

“Why…”

Miyuki didn’t know what to do – if she used magic, so would Minami. Minami’s magic blocked physical events, and it couldn’t stop Cocytus. However, Minami’s magic calculation area had been overheated, and if she tried to use magic again… it could even deprive her of her life.

“Minami-san, I’m sorry!”

Minoru took advantage of Miyuki’s indecision. He stretched his hand around Minami’s waist and jumped back with her, slipping through the air towards the stairs. Miyuki quickly went out of the ward, but she stopped when she saw Minami’s glance from over Minoru’s shoulder.

If Miyuki attacked Minoru, Minami would defend him from it. Miyuki feared the consequences which bound her thinking.

Minoru escaped from the hospital through the window of the landing, but Miyuki did not see it.

She ran back to the ward, and after making several mistakes while operating the terminal, finally managed to call Tatsuya’s communicator.

◊ ◊ ◊

“Onii-sama, Minami-chan...!”

Miyuki’s desperate cry returned tension in Tatsuya’s heart right as he calmed down.

“Miyuki, what happened?” he hurried to ask, trying to calm down as he held back the trepidation that came along with the tension.

“Minami-chan is with Minoru-kun!”

“He could still kidnap her!?” Tatsuya exclaimed.

“Yes! No!”

Miyuki’s response was completely meaningless. She was clearly very worried.

“Miyuki, I'll be back as soon as possible.”

Tatsuya didn’t further interrogate Miyuki.

“Do you hear me, Miyuki? I’m coming back to you.”

“...Yes.”

Tatsuya’s words diminished Miyuki’s panic, if only a little.

“Miyuki. I'm leaving now.”

“Yes, okay!”

After finishing his conversation with Miyuki, Tatsuya faced Lina.

“Tatsuya, go,” Lina spoke first. “I’ll figure it out here. You should hurry to Miyuki.”

“I’ll rely on you then, Lina.”

Without saying anything to Ayako or Fumiya, Tatsuya ran to the aircar. It pulled forward as soon as he sat in the driver’s seat, and Ayako turned at the sound.

As Ayako, Lina, and Hyogo silently watched, the light-blue care flew off towards Tokyo.

(To be continued in the “Chase” chapter…)





Volume 27 Afterword

So, that was the 27th volume of the “The Irregular at Magic Highschool”, titled

“Sudden Change”. Did you like it?

I haven’t had the chance to compare with something, so this may be prejudice, but it seems to me that I have problems with naming both the entire series and individual arcs. I usually come up the names after writing a general plot, but before writing the text, I always again painfully reflect on the name of the arc after reflecting on the plot.

There have been cases when I changed the name of the arc in this process. For example, at the stage of writing the plot of "City Insurrection", it had the name

"Intrigue in Kyoto". There was also a case when writing the plot that there was not a single good option for the name of the arc, so it was with the "The beginning of unrest." I also wondered whether to give the arch of the "Ten Master Clans Conference" the title "Problems for the Ten Main Clans", but in the end I left the name "Ten Master Clans Conference".

This time I suffered the most. At the stage of writing 24 volumes, I completely revised the plot of the entire series and realized that the names of the arcs prepared in advance were no longer suitable for use. After the revision and prior to the direct writing of the text, I was tormented: would it be possible to make volumes 26 and 27 a two-part arc called “Invasion”? Or call it “Treason”? Or "Sudden Change"?

Time was running out, and it was necessary to decide whether the 26th volume would go to print under the title "Invasion (Part 1)". As a result, the idea of a two-volume arc was abandoned. We decided to use the name "Sudden Change", because the name

"Betrayal" was too much of a spoiler. To be honest, I was tormented by the agony of the choice, even after writing the first version of the text.

Conversely, the title of the next arch "Chase" was coined without any suffering. I think everyone who read the current volume "Sudden Turn" understands why this title was chosen. The name for the next arc is also almost settled, but it also contains a spoiler, so for now this is a secret.

It was decided that the next arc "Chase" will consist of two volumes. I think you already understand that the main topic will be Tatsuya's chase for Minoru, but his classmates from the First School will also have a lot of activity. The story line Masaki, Akane and Liu Li Lei is also far from complete. The arch "chase" will be filled with a variety of events.

I hope that you will read to the end of the " The Irregular at Magic Highschool ", the plot of which continues to evolve rapidly.

Thank you again for continuing to read us. (Sato Tsutomu)
