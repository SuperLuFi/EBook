My body, “me” myself, was being recreated.

By my brother’s will, by my brother’s strength.

Merely calling it magic could not describe its power, its exquisiteness, and its audacity yet delicacy.

No, without a doubt, this is “magic”.

This is something truly worthy of the appellation “magic”.

I felt like I could see the God of Death, in the distance, turning away.

Absolutely helpless and seeming rather vexed.

Of course, that must have been a hallucination.

The God of Death in my hallucination seemed rather human, and without thinking, I gave a little laugh.

There was no longer any sensation of blood welling up in my throat at all.

“Miyuki, are you alright!?”

My brother’s anxious face filled my now clear field of view.

This is the first time I’ve seen such raw emotion on this person’s face.

“Onii-sama……”

For some reason, that word passed smoothly through my lips.

There was no feel of stuttering at all.

“Thank goodness……!”

It’s fine to tremble.

It’s fine to get flustered even more.





I mean, that person is tightly and firmly embracing me.

—But I shamelessly felt that being in Onii-sama’s arms was where I belonged, as if this were only natural.

That must be why, when Onii-sama embraced me, I had reflexively grabbed the hem of his shirt.

Onii-sama looked at me with wide open eyes, then softening them, stroked my head.

“Ah……”

Without thinking, my voice leaked out.

In response Onii-sama gave a decidedly teasing smile, then looked away as if embarrassed— his face tightened.

He was expressionless not in the sense of lacking emotion, but in the sense that he seemed to be fully concentrating on something.

As if he were desperately remembering something.

In his line of sight were, even now on death’s door, the profiles of Okaa-sama and Sakurai-san.

“Onii-sama!”

Without answering my call, or perhaps his focus was such that he couldn’t even afford to do so, Onii-sama pulled out a CAD with his left hand.

An utterly incredible torrent of Psions stirred in Onii-sama’s body.

Onii-sama was constructing a vast Psion Information Aide capable of holding unbelievable amounts of data.

His index finger pulled the trigger of his CAD.

It seemed as if Okaa-sama’s body was being sucked into Onii-sama’s left hand.

That was an illusion of course.



I don’t know what he’s doing, but I do know what’s happening.

I could guess correctly, because the exact same thing had happened to me.

Onii-sama took all the data configuring Okaa-sama’s body, copied it into his magic processing area, and after processing overwrote Okaa-sama’s physical information.

The gunshot wounds disappeared.

The blood splattering the floor and soaking her clothes disappeared.

In a rush, I ran up to Okaa-sama’s fallen body.

Although pale, sure enough, she was breathing.

The same state as just before she was shot…… No, this is…… Making it as if she were never shot in the first place?

Onii-sama pointed the CAD in his left hand towards Sakurai-san.

In a speed incomparable with Okaa-sama’s turn, he quickly and smoothly completed the Psion Information Aide.

Is he getting used to it……?

After just three tries, Onii-sama has already mastered this ultra-high level magic capable of completely restoring a person’s body!

I trembled in awe, yet at the same time my heart coolly regarded this as only natural.



—I mean, this person is my Onii-sama after all—

My chest was full of pride.

All of my ignorant foolishness, scattered to the winds.



With a face saying “I don’t believe it”, Sakurai-san looked down at her own body. Okaa-sama had not awoken, but her breathing was stable. She hadn’t fainted but was rather merely sleeping so there was no pressing worry, said the Army surgeon who had hurried over, and I gave a sigh of relief.

“I am sorry. For an uprising to happen here is completely my fault. This won’t be able to change anything, but if there is anything you want, please just say it. As a soldier of the National Defense Force, I will do whatever is within my power.”

Onii-sama, next to me, turned to face Captain Kazama.

Seeing the Captain’s bowed visage, he said “please raise your head”.

It seemed the reason Onii-sama had been able to rush over at the very last minute had been thanks to the help of Captain Kazama and Lieutenant Sanada. Those rebels likely intended to kidnap us as hostages, and looking back we had managed to escape that due to Lance Corporal Higaki’s intervention. —Their real target had been that man, and we had simply been caught up in the situation. He was an executive in a munitions company, and both him and his family were now guarded in a separate room. That means the military, by having us share a room with that man, were responsible for our deaths. It’s also an indisputable fact however that it was thanks to the time Higaki-san bought, that Onii-sama was able to make it in time.

But, if it weren’t for Onii-sama’s magic, there is no doubt that Okaa-sama, Sakurai-san and I would have died.

Emotionally, this couldn’t be overlooked.

“Then first of all, please tell us the exact situation.”

I didn’t intend to demand anything.

I’m sorry, but I wouldn’t have allowed Sakurai-san to take the lead either.

Even if Okaa-sama had been awake, in this case I would have had her remain silent.

This is a right for Onii-sama alone.

“Is the enemy the Great Asian Alliance?”

“We have no conclusive evidence yet, but that is most likely the case.”

“It’s a lie that we’ve stopped them at the coast, isn’t it?”

“That is so. On the West coast of Nagoshi, submerged enemy troops have already made a landing in force.”

……Then the submarine that time was in preparation for this?

“The enemy navy holds supremacy over the waters of the Keramas. In addition, from Naha to Nago, guerrillas in collusion with the enemy are disrupting the movement of personnel.”

……That sounds pretty bad.

“But all is not lost. The number of guerrillas was not that great from the beginning. Control has been regained in 80% of the areas affected. The internal rebellion in the Army will soon be shut down as well.”

“Their purpose of buying time to secure the landings is already done, so their use is at an end. Like tossing a piece of garbage, I believe the Great Asian Alliance couldn’t care less about their loss.”

At Onii-sama’s dispassionate point, Captain Kazama’s face twisted sourly.

“Next, please protect my mother, sister, and Sakurai-san in a safe place. If possible, somewhere safer than the shelters.”

“……We’ll take them to the Air Defense Command and Control Center. The armor there is twice as thick as the shelters.”

……I was scandalised. The Command and Control Center operated by the military was far better protected than the shelters they had evacuated the civilians to. Then again this is a military base after all, so I guess that’s just how things were built.

“Lastly, please lend me an Armor Suit and infantry kit. Well, I say lend, but I won’t be able to return the expendable supplies to you.”

“……Why?”

I also could not help feeling uneasy about this request.

Why, Onii-sama?

And why did you not include yourself in your earlier request?

Looking into Onii-sama’s eyes, trying to discern his true intentions, I gasped.

Within his eyes,

Making mere rage seem lukewarm,

Burned all consuming hellfire.

“They dared to raise their hand against Miyuki. They must reap their just reward.”

Amongst all those who heard that voice and felt their blood run cold, for Captain Kazama to keep his complexion unchanged, spoke volumes for his courage.

“Do you intend to go alone?”

“This is not a military operation. This is personal.”

“I don’t mind that in particular. It is impossible for humans to fight a war separate from emotions. Even a fight for revenge, as long as it is controlled, is no problem.”

Onii-sama and Captain Kazama’s eyes met.

Rather, they were glaring at each other.

“We cannot allow the slaughter of non-combatants and the surrendered, but you have no such intention anyway right?”

“I do not intend to give them the grace of surrender.”

“That is fine. Our mission is the repulsion of the invaders or their utter destruction. There is no need to offer surrender.”

Captain Kazama is a different kind of person to Onii-sama, but his resolve is not one whit less.

“Shiba Tatsuya-kun. We welcome you to our line of battle.”

Onii-sama, showed no hint of gratitude.

“I do not intend to follow the command of the army. What I fight for, and what you fight for, are different things. But we share a common enemy, and if we share a common goal of annihilation, then let us fight side by side.”

Like a steel edge tempered by a legendary craftsman, the air around Onii-sama was cold, sharp, merciless……At such an Onii-sama, I could only stare in awe.

“Very well. Sanada, find him an Armor Suit and gear! Airborne, we move in 10!”

“Sakurai-san, please look after my mother and sister.”

Standing, Onii-sama said so to Sakurai-san, then without waiting for her reply followed after Lieutenant Sanada.

That time, the faint smile he wore when he looked at me was definitely not an illusion.




“Um, are you sure this is alright?”

As I watched my brother’s back receding, Sakurai-san stepped up to me and began talking.

“What is it?”

It seems, as if my thought processes had been sabotaged or escaped altogether; I had not moved my attention for a while.

“However skilled Tatsuya-kun is, fighting a war…… Nevermind rushing straight to the front lines, isn’t that far too dangerous?”

“!”

Sakurai-san’s whisper, rang in my ears like a loud alarm clock.

That’s right! What am I spacing out so calmly for? Onii-sama is going to war!

“Miyuki-san!?”

Sakurai-san’s voice floated behind my back as I ran.

Only her voice chased me.

She cannot afford to leave Okaa-sama.

I’m sorry.

I apologised to her in my heart.

Leaving Okaa-sama behind is painful, but right now, I have to stop Onii-sama!

I ran with that one thought in mind.

Fortunately, he had not yet gone that far ahead, and I caught up to him without getting lost.

“Onii-sama!”

He might not turn around. That fear flashed through my mind but it was a needless worry.

Onii-sama said something quietly to Lieutenant Sanada in front of him, then halted and faced this way.

Sanada-san stopped a while ahead. He probably did so with our consideration in mind.

“Miyuki, what is it?”

At him naturally, in a natural tone calling me “Miyuki” I began to dreamily glaze over again, but this isn’t the time for that.

“Onii-sama, um,”

I suddenly realised that I must not, under any circumstance, begin saying “please don’t go” over and over.

That’s far too much like the kind of thing a heroine would say to stop her lover in some romance movie (or novel or manga or whatever) or something.

Not to mention bringing in the whole “forbidden love between brother and sister” mess.

“Miyuki?”

As I stood suddenly lost for words, Onii-sama looked at me in a puzzled manner.

My cheeks must have been bright red.

“……Pl-Please don’t go.”

Even so, it’s not like I can just not say it then. I have to stop him.

“Please don’t do something so dangerous as fighting the enemy army. I don’t believe there’s any need for Onii-sama to do something so risky.”

I said it……!

Feeling a sense of accomplishment, I thought “this should be fine”.

For Onii-sama to shake his head at my words— to shake his head at all, was something I had never once considered.

“Certainly, there’s no need. I am not going because there’s a need, but because I wish to, Miyuki.”

Which was why my brother’s reply was such a shock to me.

Shocked at the denial, and shocked at his words almost implying he wanted to kill people.

But my body, rather than trying to distance itself from him, reached out and caught his sleeve.

With a clumsy smile, he took hold of my hand grasping onto his jacket, and gently pulled it away.

“As I said earlier, I am going for revenge against those who have hurt you.”

Looking into my eyes, Onii-sama’s expression was almost embarrassed.

“Not for your sake, but for the sake of my own feelings.”

While saying so, Onii-sama’s pupils…

“If I don’t, I won’t be able to rest.”

Seemed to be telling me that everything was for my sake.

“To me, the only thing I can feel is truly precious is you alone, Miyuki.”

That wasn’t my mistake.

“Sorry for being such a selfish brother.”

That wasn’t my conceit.

Onii-sama softly released my hand, and gave me a laugh while maintaining his somewhat embarrassed expression.

My entire face must have been burning red.

However, recalling something troubling in Onii-sama’s words, I furrowed my brow.

“Can feel, is precious……?”

Just now Onii-sama hadn’t said “is precious”, but “can feel is precious” right?

It’s simply a slight difference in wording, and may not have any particular meaning behind it but…… For some reason, I’m anxious.

As those words subconsciously slipped from my mouth which wasn’t even a question, Onii-sama gave a wry smile which seemed to say “you got me”.

His expression seemed to be laughing, yet crying.

There was nothing like tears, not to mention I have never even once seen Onii-sama cry, yet somehow I could sense that to Onii-sama this was a matter fraught with pain and full of sorrow.

“I am sorry!”

So I apologised. I had vowed that I would cause Onii-sama no more sadness, and yet again I……thinking so, I bowed low.

Two slender hands slipped through and parted my long hair, caressing my cheeks. Onii-sama’s hands, slim yet far bigger than mine, strong and firm.

His hands gently lifted my head, and I looked up.

There was no force in them, yet I could never resist. Rather, faster than my head could resist, my body complied with Onii-sama’s will.

“No……I suppose it’s about time you knew. If possible, I would have preferred that you never found out but…… As our mother’s daughter, and that person’s niece, that would have been a fleeting dream in any case.”

Onii-sama’s words were aimed at me, yet it seemed as if he wasn’t talking to me, but reminding himself.

“Onii-sama?”

“There’s no time at the moment, and I don’t believe this is something that should be heard from me. So Miyuki, please go and ask our mother. The answer to the questions you have right now.”

“From Okaa-sama……?”

To me without time to collect my uncertainties, simply blankly repeating his words back at him, Onii-sama gave one more smile, this time strong.

“Miyuki, don’t worry. You are the one thing precious to me. Therefore, in order to continue protecting you in the future, I will definitely come back safe.”

There was no deceit in Onii-sama’s words.

There was no sense of comforting.

“I’ll be alright.”

Sheathing his smile and tightening his expression, his gaze unwavering,

As if it were a true and undeniable fact.

“There is nothing in existence which can hurt me in the truest sense.”

I believed that there was nothing at all which could harm Onii-sama.

Onii-sama moved his hands from my cheek to my head, and stroked my hair.

He ran his hands over my now slightly messed up hair, laughing all the while, then moved to continue after Lieutenant Sanada.

This time, for real, Onii-sama headed towards the battlefield.




Then again, as you’d expect, I had no idea where this Command and Control Center place was.

I had no choice but to return to that room which has lost its wall.

Come to think of it, how did the wall disappear?

Onii-sama and Sakurai-san had said that a barrier which blocked magic had been incorporated, meaning that the chances it had been destroyed by magic were low, yet the cross section was so surgically precise that it was hard to imagine any other way.

Although I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t leave me behind, I couldn’t help being anxious and returned to the room at a trot.

Ah……

“I’m sorry for having kept you waiting.”

First I apologised to Okaa-sama, who greeted me.

As important as it is to recover her strength, there’s no way she can simply be carried on a stretcher, so thinking about it, it’s only natural that she’d be awoken by some means.

Because of my own selfish discretion and abandonment of Okaa-sama, which resulted in forcing them to wait, I bowed low not to escape her anger, but out of true regret.

“There’s no need to apologise, Miyuki-san. You went to stop Tatsuya going off as he pleased, didn’t you?”

Okaa-sama answered with a smile.

Uu……She’s pretty mad……

“So, where did Tatsuya go? I don’t see him around.”

“That’s, um……Onii-sama went to help the military fight the enemy.”

“Onii-sama?”

Okaa-sama raised an eyebrow.

Reflexively I thought “oh dear”, but I didn’t once think of correcting myself.

Okaa-sama didn’t reprove me either.

Instead of blame, she simply gave a long sigh.

“Doing things his own way as usual……that child truly is defective.”

Her words weren’t denouncing, they were forsaking.

Not resignation, but abandonment.

I didn’t even have to ask who she was talking about.

Rather than indignation, I felt appalled.

For a mother to be so utterly indifferent concerning her own son.

“Well, whatever. Things seem to have somehow worked out this time, so let him do as he wants…… Thanks for waiting. Please take us now.”

Okaa-sama spoke to the soldier waiting to guide us.



No, things didn’t “somehow” work out.

The only reason I’m alive, the only reason Okaa-sama was saved, was because of Onii-sama.

Yet to that “somehow”, I was unable to say a word in dispute.



Entering the Command and Control Center, we had passed through no less than five blast doors.

On a floor around the size of four classrooms with no windows and no walls connected directly to the outside, around 30 operators sat in front of three rows of consoles in one hall, while opposite the large wall-mounted screen was an entrance leading to eight single mezzanine rooms.

We were lead to one of the single rooms with a glass front.

“I don’t sense any cameras or wiretap surveillance. It seems like this is one of the rooms high level officers and executives in the Ministry of Defense use while on inspection.”

After examining the room, Sakurai-san informed Okaa-sama.

I have no idea what she did or how she did it, but her findings are always reliable.

That means it’s okay to talk about secrets in here.

“The glass in front isn’t just ordinary glass either. They have the same thing in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. It’s capable of projecting anything from the monitors in the Command and Control Center.”

Sakurai said so while watching the desktop monitor and operating the console.

“Okaa-sama, there’s something I’d like to ask.”

In the meantime, I decided to take the plunge, and ask Okaa-sama about the matter from before.

“Earlier, Onii-sama had said that the only thing which he can consider precious is me, but……when I asked him why he didn’t say ‘is precious’ but rather ‘can feel is precious’, he said I should ask you, so……”

“I see. Tatsuya said that.”

Listening to my question with a frown, Okaa-sama said that with a bored expression.

“I suppose it’s about time you knew.”

Onii-sama had said the same thing. Just thinking about what this big secret was, I stiffened with tension.

“But, before that……Miyuki-san, stop calling Tatsuya ‘Onii-sama’. I don’t really mind in public places and the like where the presence of others can’t be helped, but when alone with only the Yotsuba, you should not be treating Tatsuya like your brother.”

Okaa-sama didn’t reprove me in a strong tone, but was as if simply regaling me with an undeniable truth.

“You are the one who will follow after Maya and become the head of the Yotsuba. If you’re seen depending on the utter failure that is your brother, it could become a huge minus in the future someday.”

“That way of speaking is……!”

I instinctively forgot my restraint, and harshly rebuked my mother.

As tense as I was while listening carefully, no matter how much they were Okaa-sama’s words I simply could not let them go unanswered.

“Calling your own child an utter failure like that!”

“I also think it’s unfortunate, but it’s the truth so it can’t be helped.”

“That’s wrong! With his power, Onii-sama saved me!”

“That thing earlier? True, if he can’t at least display that level of……still, that is all he can do.”

At my heartfelt objection, Okaa-sama answered in a voice colder than I had ever heard up to now.

It was a voice which had abandoned all hope.

“If Tatsuya has told you to come to me, then I don’t particularly mind. Where to begin……”

As my mother remained deep in thought, without warning the window taking the place of an entire wall changed the projected scenery.

The room full of frantically working operators changed to a bird’s-eye view looking down on the earth.

In that view I saw Onii-sama, having just dropped from the sky.

I looked over at the one who had brought that up, Sakurai-san.

Sakurai-san was wordlessly watching me—watching me and Okaa-sama.

That she didn’t intend to speak a word was obvious at a glance.

I also understood that she knew many things that I did not.

—Okaa-sama didn’t so much as glance at the screen now showing Onii-sama.





“Tatsuya was born defective as a magician.”

Okaa-sama didn’t look at me either.

“It’s not that I feel no responsibility for bearing such a child, but the unchangeable fact was that Tatsuya was a hopeless cause as a magician.”

That didn’t mean she had closed her eyes.

“From the time he was born, Tatsuya could use only two types of ‘magic’. Decomposition of Eidos, and reconstruction of Information Bodies. Within the concept of these two categories Tatsuya has devised a variety of techniques he can use, but however far you take them, with just those two, it is impossible to alter Information Bodies as a true magician should.”

Her eyes simply stared into nothingness.

“Magic are the techniques which modify Information bodies, and thus change phenomena. However trivial the change is, to be able to make the change at all is magic. But Tatsuya is unable to do that. All he can do is break an Information Body down, and recreate it back in an earlier state. That is not magic in its truest sense. That child, who was born without the talent to use magic in the true sense of the term in altering Information Bodies, is unquestionably a defective magician.”

Perhaps, what Okaa-sama was looking into, was her own heart……

“Well, that reconstruction ability did end up saving us, but strictly speaking that power is not ‘magic’.”

I did not refute her words.

But, I thought.

If that isn’t magic, then just what, should that power be called.

If it is to be given a name other than “magic”, then doesn’t that only leave the word “miracle”?

“But, we the Yotsuba are magicians who stand amongst the Ten Master Houses, and therefore one who cannot use magic cannot be a Yotsuba. That child, unable to use magic, could not live as one of the Yotsuba. So Maya and I, seven years ago, performed a certain operation on him. Although truth be told, the motivation behind that experiment wasn’t that alone……”

Experiment? Okaa-sama, on Onii-sama?

“The Artificial Magician Plan. A project to implant in the consciousness of a person who isn’t a magician, a man-made magic operation area and thus give him the abilities of a magician.”

Artificial Magician Plan. Those words rang ominously in my ears.

“As a result of undergoing that mental reconstruction surgery, that child ended up losing his emotions.”

“Mental reconstruction surgery? Lost his emotions?”

“No, rather than saying emotions it may be better to say urges. Strong anger, deep sorrow, intense jealousy, grudges, hatred, hungering appetite, sexual lust, blind love. Such ‘beside oneself’ impulses were lost, with one single exception, and in exchange Tatsuya obtained the ability to use magic.”

That means……

“Unfortunately, the artificial magic operation area is markedly inferior in performance to that of a natural one, and he could only end up being used as a Guardian.”

I won’t believe it, I thought.

There’s no way that could be, I thought.

“The one who performed that ‘surgery’……was it you, Okaa-sama?”

While thinking so, I couldn’t help but ask.

The large “window” now showed Onii-sama, surrounded by well-built adults, making contact with the enemy landing force.

“Who else could do it but me?”

My sincerest wish, that she would deny it, was not to be.

I really should have known.

The Magic Operation Area is not a physical area in the cerebrum, but rather is a direct mental function.

Adding an artificial Magic Operation Area would therefore entail altering the mental structure.

That would be impossible without Okaa-sama’s magic, “Mental Structure Interference”……

“……Why would you do that?”

“I’ve already told you the reasons. Let’s answer something more important you wish to know.”



—Ah, I see……

I’ve also noticed.

I realised.

In that experiment, it was not only Onii-sama who ended up losing some of his emotions.

I don’t know whether it’s a side effect of that magic, a sense of guilt or some other different mental effect but,

For the first time, I felt terror at this thing called “magic”.

This “magic”, which could so cruelly alter the human heart.



On the screen, Onii-sama pointed a large pistol shaped CAD at the foe.

Before him, enemy after enemy faded to dust.

“The one exception that Tatsuya didn’t lose…… Answer me that.”

“The one impulse left to him, is brotherly love.”

—Please stop already, Okaa-sama.

“Love towards his sister, in other words you, and the desire to protect you.”

—I don’t want to hear any more.

“That is all he has left, his one true emotion.”

But that was not allowed to me.

Holding my two hands in front of my mouth was an instinctive action.

It may have been a conditioned reflex.

There wasn’t really a need for it though.

I was so shocked, to the extent I couldn’t let out a cry.

“Tatsuya himself knows well. That’s what he means by ‘can feel is precious’. He thinks of me simply as his ‘mother’, and the natural parent-child attachment which should go with it does not exist. The only one he can hold dear in his heart is only you, Miyuki. Back then, he simply saved me incidentally. Or perhaps, merely because he determined if I were to die then you would be sad.”

“Did Okaa-sama……intentionally choose for this to happen?”

Even though I was speaking myself, it felt like I heard someone else talking. It felt like a me which was not me was moving my body and asking questions.

“I obviously didn’t plan things out to that extent. However, I did think that if the capacity that was left was only enough for one emotion, then it should be affection directed towards you. Tatsuya will be spending far more time with you, after all.”

“Did you say that to O— No, that person?”

“Of course I explained. That child still has plenty of common sense. Having no parental affection is trivial in any case, so there’s no need to worry about it.”

When she said that,

Faintly,

I felt I could glimpse Okaa-sama’s suffering that she could not love her child.

“Is there anything else?”

“No……thank you very much.”

A part of me, felt that I shouldn’t have asked.

A part of me, also felt truly glad that I did ask.

To squarely face a painful past, and painful truths, yet unflinchingly look forwards to the present and the future.

The screen showed Onii-sama, advancing resolutely into a desolate wasteland.

Neither shell nor bullet could reach him.

Tank-like things pointed their turrets at Onii-sama, and vanished along with the crew inside.

Onii-sama continued without changing pace.

But the soldiers advancing with Onii-sama did not move the same way.

To not be left behind by Onii-sama, they ran as if flying from cover to cover, shooting guns and magic all the while.

Ah!

One of the soldiers was hit.

Seeing the battlefield from a camera in the sky, it’s like watching something right from a movie.

Within the screen, before I could even begin feeling shock, Onii-sama was pointing the CAD in his left hand at the fallen soldier.

When did he?

There was barely any time to even turn his neck.

In the next moment, the soldier began running on the screen again as if nothing had happened.



An enemy turret spat fire.

It didn’t reach.

Onii-sama raised his right hand.

The enemy form disappeared. It was almost like the special effects of a movie.

Allied soldiers fell.

Onii-sama raised his left hand.

Just with that, the fallen soldiers rose unscathed and continued the fight.



What was shown on that screen was to me, with a far greater grasp of magic than not only the general public but most magicians, like a movie with an extremely poor sense of reality.

But those would be the irresponsible thoughts of a bystander.

To the soldiers fighting alongside Onii-sama, it was a fortune beyond their wildest hopes. Any injuries, even fatal ones, were healed immediately as if merely waking from a dream.

To the enemies fighting against Onii-sama, he was terror incarnate. A nightmare who raised their foes, and obliterated all before him leaving only shadows and dust.

Like an Avatar, Onii-sama strode across the battlefield.

All because I had gotten shot.

That was something decreed seven years ago, from the time he was only six.

How can I possibly make it up to him?

What can I do to ever make it up to him?



Even this life now, is something I owe completely to him.





Chapter 15




November 6th, AD 2095 / Yotsuba Main House - Drawing room

It had been one week since they parted at Tsushima base.

On that day, Tatsuya had been dismissed earlier, and beyond what was available to the general public, knew no more about the final outcomes of the battle than anyone else. Having the opportunity to reunite with Kazama here, he tried asking various questions, but it seemed there were many parts unknown even to Kazama.

Exchanging information with Kazama — although all that Tatsuya could provide could not be said to possess certainty beyond the boundaries of “rumors” — Tatsuya, deep in thought, suddenly turned to face the door.

Tension crept down Miyuki’s spine.

From her brother’s expression, she knew.

At last—

“Excuse me.”

After a formal knock, the door was opened without waiting for a reply.

Bowing deferentially this time was an elderly butler. Visibly different from the youth earlier, this man clearly possessed a high position.

However, he said no more.

Despite the fact that simply opening the door shouldn’t be the extent of this man’s job.

But neither Tatsuya and Miyuki, nor Kazama felt any suspicion.

Rather, they were thinking similarly, that the only one fit for this role must be this elderly man.

“Thank you for waiting.”

For behind the elderly man, stood the figure of the Head of this House.



“I truly am very sorry. Our previous guest simply would not leave……while he had gone far past our appointed time, we couldn’t simply throw him out or such……”

“Please do not be concerned. We know that you are very busy.”

Kazama returned Maya’s bow, and at length they both sat down.

“Miyuki-san, my apologies to you as well.”

At that, Miyuki also sat down slowly.

However, she said not a word to Tatsuya.

He simply remained standing next to the sofa Miyuki sat in.

In appearance, he mirrored exactly the butler who now stood next to Maya.

White porcelain teacups were set down before three people.

It went without speaking that those three were Maya, Kazama, and Miyuki.

Maya beckoned the two to their tea, and after taking a sip herself, cut straight to the point.

“The reason I have called you here today is because there are some matters stemming from the recent military incident in Yokohama which I would like to tell you.”

“To me?”

Maya the civilian was saying that she had things to tell, not ask, concerning military matters to the military man Kazama. Of course he would repeat it.

“Yes, and to Tatsuya-san and Miyuki-san as well.”

Saying so, Maya gave a meaningful smile.

Without even having to look bored as she said so, her expression made it plain that her truly pressing matters were for Tatsuya and Miyuki.

“A week ago, the International Magic Association concluded that the blast which obliterated the Zhènhai Naval Port was not in violation of the charter forbidding the use of ‘radiation emitting weapons’ ”.

“Radiation emitting weapons” was an abbreviation for “weapons which contaminate the environment with residual radioactivity”, a term mainly used by the International Magic Association, whose purpose is preventing the use of weapons which emit and leave behind radioactive residues as well as the national magic associations affiliated with them. The word “weapon” was used, but the clause also included any magic which would result in radioactive contamination. The term itself was rare outside the Association, but despite being somewhat of a traditionalist magician, Kazama nevertheless naturally knew about it.

“As a result, the punishment motion submitted to the Association was rejected.”

Miyuki’s tense expression tensed even further for a moment, then relaxed.

“I was not aware a punishment motion had been forwarded.”

Kazama replied in a bland tone. Miyuki knew that there was no way Kazama hadn’t at least considered the possibility, but didn’t speak a word.

“You do seem rather relaxed. You had no concern about the possibility of a penal detachment?”

By contrast, Maya hit back with a direct question.

Magicians were administered by the state, weapons of the state, and as such belonged to the state.

Even private magicians were forbidden from acting in any way which might go against the national interest. In this respect, globally, the rights of magicians were significantly limited in comparison to those of non-magicians.

Because of that, the International Magic Association had no military force of its own. The magicians belonging to the IMA were not of a scale anywhere approaching a force.

In return, the IMA called for the cooperation of each member state in order to implement multinational teams. If this “mystery bomb” had resulted in the formation of a penal detail, those various countries which wished for a decline in Japan’s national power would have sent their own powerful magicians along as well. As someone involved in the military, that was not a negligible concern.

“I was fully aware and confident that there would be no residual radiation.”

Kazama didn’t say that she should have been well aware as well. It was so obvious there was no need to do so.

Sure enough, Maya changed the subject.

“Then were you aware that the ‘Heavenly General’ was present with and perished alongside the fleet?”

“Liú Yúndé?”

At Maya’s news, Kazama’s poker face collapsed.

Kazama’s wide eyes as he asked back was unfeigned.

“Yes, one of the thirteen internationally acknowledged Strategic Class magicians. Nevertheless, the Great Asian Alliance is trying to keep a rather tight lid on information control.”

Although there was no such thing as privacy when it came to Strategic Class magicians, Maya laughed.

As she said, Strategic Class magicians, individuals wielding power comparable to weapons of mass destruction, were of great interest to many major powers and of greater interest to their magicians. Aside from gimmicks like Antinite, the only true counter to a magician was another magician, and as such, keeping enemy Strategic magicians in check was a major objective of military magicians.

Thirteen Strategic Class magicians had been declassified for the sake of national prestige, and amongst these so called “thirteen Apostles” the only one who had managed to keep a modicum of secrecy was the USNA’s Angie Sirius.

Of course Japan was no exception in keeping extensive tabs on the Thirteen Apostles and the Ten Families, with the inclusion of Angie Sirius of whom besides her name — to be precise her nickname and codename — not even her real face was known, and devoted great effort to that field.

“Well with that, I guess the ‘Thirteen Apostles’ is now the ‘Twelve Apostles’.”

Maya smoothly summarized that major upheaval in international military balance with one easy sentence.

This was confidential information which even Kazama had not been informed of.

“It seems the government is looking to capitalize on this and wring as many major concessions from the Great Asian Alliance as possible. The Chief of Staff had requested the Itsuwa be sent out, and the Itsuwa complied. Mio-san is accompanying them to the fleet in Sasebo.”

“Did she board a warship?”

Until now, Miyuki had respectfully maintained her position as a listener, but at this she instinctively spoke up.

“Yes.”

However, Maya did not reprimand her. This news was astonishing enough that such a reaction would not be unreasonable.

Itsuwa Mio was the only Strategic Class magician the Japanese government had publicly disclosed, one of the “Thirteen Apostles”.

As far as had been confirmed, with the exception of Tatsuya, she was the only Japanese Strategic magician.

A trump card of the Japanese military.

Her magic “Abyss” was capable of creating a spherical depression which can extend from a few tens of meters to several kilometers. Amongst Movement Systematic magics it possesses its own classification, Fluid Control. Vessels caught within the magical zone at sea slide down the steep walls of water, tumbling about, then upon cancellation of the magic are swallowed up by massive waves as the sea returns to a horizontal plane. The hemisphere can be created up to a kilometer in depth, easily catching submerged submarines as well.

This is a strategic class magic theoretically capable of eradicating entire fleets with a single blow, however;

“Abyss” can also be invoked upon subterranean ground water, potentially allowing it to collapse vast swathes of structures as well.

“……Still, that would be a considerable strain on her body wouldn’t it?”

“I’m sure they’ve factored that in. Both the Staff and the Itsuwa. They probably consider this too big to miss.”

At Miyuki’s worried question, Maya gave an absent-minded answer.

In contrast to Itsuwa Mio’s powerful magic, her body was quite weak.

It wasn’t quite apparent until around her mid teens, but from the age of 20 she was forced to use a motorized wheelchair to move around. It wasn’t that her legs were afflicted such that she couldn’t walk, but because even the slightest exertion was exhausting. After graduating from university, it was said she rarely ever left the Itsuwa house.

The Itsuwa were currently one of the Ten Master Houses, but in fact that was largely based on the fact that they had the Strategic Class magician Mio. For her to be aboard a warship that would likely see battle, however brief that period of time was, could only be said to be a gamble.

“Just as we had news of Liú Yúndé’s movements, it seems our mobilization of Mio-san has not gone unnoticed. Again this is as of yet unconfirmed, but we have received a report that Doctor Bezobrazov arrived in Vladivostok today.”

Hearing that name, Kazama’s expression was moved again.

“—The ‘Igniter’ Igor Andreevich Bezobrazov?”

“Yes, that very Doctor Bezobrazov. Having witnessed the recent events off the Southern Korean Peninsula, their military leadership appears to have reconsidered the effectiveness of large scale magic.”

While he didn’t let out a sound, Tatsuya was just as surprised.

Igor Andreevich Bezobrazov was a scientist in the Soviet Academy of Science, yet at the same time, a Strategic Class magician of the New Soviet Union.

He was not a classified Strategic magician like Tatsuya, but rather like Mio was a state recognized member of the Thirteen Apostles. His Strategic magic “Tuman Bomba[16]”, whilst one step outclassed by the USNA’s Angie Sirius’ “Heavy Metal Burst” in power, was said to possess the greatest destructive radius of the Thirteen.

Until now, countries had only demonstrated their Strategic magics without applying them for actual combat use, but in the most recent conflict four Strategic magicians, including Tatsuya, had been mobilized.

“It’s likely the Great Asian Alliance has received similar intel—”

“Peace should be established in the near future then?”

“I believe that would be the case.”

In that pause, Maya looked at Kazama with a smile. Despite the fact she was in her mid 40s, that smile combined youthful cuteness and adult sex appeal which made her seem no older than 30.

Such charm was wasted on Kazama however, as he silently waited for the next words.

“……Our history from since three years ago, will be settled with this.”

The slight color of frustration which flitted past Maya’s face as she resumed her talk couldn’t have wholly been Tatsuya’s imagination.

“The disappearance of Zhènhai Naval Port has attracted the attention of numerous countries. The cause of that was unmistakably due to Strategic class magic, and a not inconsiderable number of them are beginning to probe around as to just who the operator was. It is most likely some of them will link this with the annihilation of the fleet the Great Asian Alliance dispatched three years ago. It would be a very undesirable outcome for us to have Tatsuya-san’s identity to come out.”

“I fully agree.”

Seeing Kazama’s nod, Maya gave a broad smile indistinguishable between real and fake.

No, it’s likely that her smile this time was sincere.

“I’m glad you understand. Then to be on the safe side, I’d like you to refrain from being in contact with Tatsuya-san for a while as well.”



Maya’s negotiation with Kazama was steered to obtain the most satisfactory result for the Yotsuba.

It’d be too much to say that he was led around, but the concession that Tatsuya would no longer be called to battle with the Great Asian Alliance for this conflict was unmistakably Maya’s pace.

Then again the terms like “will you comply with this verbal contract” and “will you abide by all aspects of this verbal contract” are things which likely would have question marks in parenthesis after them.

Now Maya was alone with Tatsuya in the drawing room. After wrapping things up Kazama naturally left—he was just as busy after all—and Miyuki had vacated the room at Maya’s direct order.

Then despite having even instructed her attendant to leave, Maya didn’t cut directly to the chase.

She simply sat for a while sipping tea from her cup with a look of dissatisfaction, as Tatsuya sat down in silence facing her.

In silence, in other words, without asking or waiting for permission.

His appearance as he leaned back in his chair waiting for her words was absent from all apprehension or fear.

Glancing at that appearance, Maya returned her cup to its saucer.

“The last time we faced each other like this was three years ago huh.”

There was no hint of hubris in her voice or expression.

“This is the first time I have been called out like this, Oba-ue[17].”

“I wonder.”

At Tatsuya’s usual cynical rather than respectful air, Maya also adopted a more informal attitude than before.

“Come to think of it, this is the first time we’ve spoken alone.”

“Yes.”

That’s not to say their rapport was “friendly”.

The light glinting in their eyes was too strong for that.

“So what is it you wished to speak about?”

“Don’t be in such a hurry. Won’t you have some tea?”

“If you start going around giving me tea, your entourage is going to start saying some annoying things.”

At Tatsuya’s all too candid remark, Maya let out a breath.

“Honesty isn’t always a virtue you know.”

“Remonstrations for the sake of another are always painful to hear.”

Their banter flew back and forth like rapid keystrokes.

Maya didn’t anger, but rather gave an approving nod.

“An unreserved companion is also good once in a while.”

“Is it disagreeable to you?”

“The relationship between us is that of nephew and aunt. There is no need for such concerns.”

After those words replied in a tone indiscernible from her true feelings or a simple façade, Maya picked up the buzzer on the table.

The faint chime of a handbell rang out, yet neither the door nor the walls of this room were particularly thin.

Despite that not a minute later a soft knock rang from the door, meaning that the room must have been monitored in some way; nevertheless Tatsuya did not hurry to stand.

“Did you call for me?”

The elderly butler from earlier returned to the scene. Even seeing Tatsuya’s leisurely seated appearance, he didn’t bat an eyelid.

“Hayama-san, some more tea for me please. And the same for Tatsuya-san as well.”

“Certainly.”

Had it been Aoki, he no doubt would have gone pale and started yelling at Tatsuya. Forgetting even that he was in the presence of Maya.

But there was no way a confidant permitted even to “eavesdrop” at the side of his master, whatever the appearance or reasons, would ever be prone to such petty outbursts.

The reason Tatsuya was so relaxed also stemmed from that.

Not to mention that it would have been impossible to “smooth things out” anyway.

Because it was visible with a glance that Tatsuya held no submissiveness towards Maya whatsoever.

While waiting for the tea, Maya didn’t utter a word.

Tatsuya likewise was in no hurry.

“Won’t you have some tea” basically meant “we’ll talk over tea”. It wasn’t particularly exerting to figure such a thing out, and only a child would make a fuss about waiting for such a period of time.

At length after taking a sip from the cup the butler Hayama brought, Maya finally seemed to be in the mood.

“Thank you for your efforts in this event, Tatsuya-san.”

Hearing that tone, no one would take those words at face value.

“No, there’s no such thing.”

Tatsuya likewise was under no delusion that he was being praised.

“However, it’s something troubling for the Yotsuba.”

“I am sorry.”

Sure enough, she began voicing complaints with a theatrical sigh, and Tatsuya gave a formal apology. Not that he did anything laudable like fall prostrate to the ground or rub his forehead against the table or anything.

“……Well, I know that you were simply following orders. Although I had wanted to ask Major Kazama if there really was a need to go so far. Well, there’s no point fretting over the past.”

“I’m sorry for the trouble.”

Tatsuya’s apology this time was slightly more sincere. Morality aside, Tatsuya also personally felt that what happened was a little overkill. —Actually not “a little” but closer to the point of excessive, mindless destruction.

“More important now are the problems from here.”

“Is there anything concrete so far?”

Maya did not give an immediate answer to Tatsuya’s question.

Rather she closed her eyes, took a sip of tea, then slowly looked up.

Directly into Tatsuya’s eyes.

Tatsuya didn’t meet her gaze, instead lifting his cup to his mouth in the same way as his aunt.

“The Stars are moving.”

Her words as she resolutely maintained eye contact held the power to freeze Tatsuya’s movement for just a moment.

“Meaning that America itself is moving, huh.”

Having at last reached this point, Maya and Tatsuya finally clashed head to head.

It was impossible to compare the weights behind them.

On the one hand Maya had the entire might of the Yotsuba at her back, while defending Tatsuya would likely be Miyuki alone.

Yet the steel in Tatsuya’s eyes did not lose an inch to the pressure Maya exuded.

“For now, the Stars have simply begun their own investigation. But they have already grasped that the explosion was caused by a magic which converts mass into energy. That narrows down the identity of the operator considerably. —Specifically, enough to pinpoint you and Miyuki-san as one of the suspects.”

At Maya’s information, Tatsuya could only shake his head.

“……That’s quite the amazing ability to gather information.”

“Their reputation as the most powerful force of magicians in the world isn’t just for show.”

“No, the one I was praising was you Oba-ue.”

There was no reply.

Maya fell silent as if deep in thought.

“Whilst I admit that they are likely the most powerful force out there, the intelligence the USNA Stars’ has managed to procure is almost real-time. Have you considered the possibility of a spy?”

“……I can’t say. Unfortunately.”

“Well of course.”

As if he had somehow worked out Maya’s response, Tatsuya nodded with a straight face.

For a moment Maya seemed rather resentful, but as expected immediately regained her smile.

“……In any case, you must be careful of your surroundings. The Stars are not like the soft opponents you have gone up against until now. If they determine that you are a threat to the hegemony of the United States, it is possible that they have the capability to take you down.”

“Meaning that if the likelihood of the Yotsuba getting involved rises too high, I can expect assassins from a different direction. I’ll bear that in mind.”

The aunt and nephew stared at each other.

There was no longer even the hint of a smile upon their face.

“It’s a bit early to be thinking that far.”

“You believed that I would arrive at that conclusion in this place, which was why you sent Miyuki outside was it not?”

Tatsuya’s wording changed slightly.

Maya did not verbally answer his challenge.

Rather, her answer could be found in her looking away.

“Tatsuya, drop out of school.”

When she finally spoke, it was not a reply but rather a command.

“Drop out of school, why?”

“To lie low here in this house for a while. The Guardianship of Miyuki-san will be transferred to another.”

“I believe the selection of Guardian was a matter for the escorted to decide.”

“Everything has its exception.”

“Well, fair enough…… But I refuse.”

If there had been another in the room, they would have shivered at the sudden drop in temperature.

Not a physical drop, but rather due to the incredible tension.

“If I suddenly drop out at this time, I believe it would be as good as a confession that I was the magician who destroyed the fleet of the Great Asian Alliance.”

“The reason is irrelevant.”

“I suppose.”

There was no longer a trace of expression upon either Maya or Tatsuya’s face.

“You are disobeying my direct order?”

“The only one allowed to order me is Miyuki alone.”

The tension reached its peak.

Within that period of urgency, as if time had stopped,



The world turned to “Night”.

It was not mere darkness.

Floating within the darkness, shone a brilliant sea of stars.

The roof of the drawing room became a moonless, starlit night sky.

The stars flowed, becoming rays of light,

—And the scent of blood suddenly filled the room.

In the next moment,

Without a sound,

That indoor “Night” shattered.



Revealed within was the tableau of the aunt and nephew, still staring at each other without change.

However the sense of tension which had once surged between them, had faded with the collapse of “Night”.

“—It seems you went rather easy on me.”

“Of course. You’re my cute nephew after all.”

Maya smiled at Tatsuya’s mutter.

No wounds remained on either of the two, and the scent of blood had faded.

“Still, even allowing for that, you did well. And so, this time I will permit you your selfishness.”

“Thank you very much.”

“It’s fine. Take it as a treat for breaking my magic.”

Wordlessly, Tatsuya rose.

At his light bow, Maya shook her hands in a flutter.

Tatsuya left the room.

There was not a voice raised in challenge to stop him from anywhere.




After Tatsuya had left the drawing room Maya had been left lost in thought alone for a while, but at length she exhaled strongly and picked up the buzzer once more.

“Did you call?”

“I’d like a change of scenery. Please prepare tea in the solarium, and bring Miyuki-san and Tatsuya-san along.”

The butler Hayama showed up immediately, and Maya dictated her wishes.

“Certainly.”

Hayama bowed, then without making eye contact quickly cleared up the cups.

As he carried out Maya’s instructions, then prepared to leave the room,

“Wait a moment.”

Maya stopped him.

“Hayama-san, there is something you want to ask me?”

Finally looking over at his mistress, Hayama bowed respectfully.

“Indeed there is. With your permission……”

Hayama had formerly served the previous Yotsuba Head and was now continuing his service under Maya. While he only appeared slightly past middle age, he was actually over 70 years old.

There were many things in this house he was able to say that others would shrink back in fear from.

“Is it really alright to leave Tatsuya-dono[18] like that?”

Also, unlike the others, he did not see Tatsuya as a “fake”. His own magic ability wasn’t of a particularly high level, but having seen countless magicians over the years his venerable experience rated Tatsuya highly.

—A magician one should be wary of.

“It’s fine. Ah, I know full well what it is you’re concerned about. Certainly, that child will betray the Yotsuba at any time.”

“……My apologies.”

“Just as I confirmed earlier, my magic is a bad match-up against that child’s unusual talent. If it came to a serious fight, it is highly likely I would lose.”

Maya’s magic was “Meteor Stream”. The Japanese name is representative of the appearance of the magic, but the English name “Meteor Line” is more representative of the nature of the magic.

This magic which had cemented Maya’s place as one of the most powerful magicians in the world, earning her the names “Devil of the Far East” and “Queen of Night” is a Convergence Type Systematic magic which controls the distribution of light in its area of effect. Its power is especially amplified in a closed space such as rooms or tunnels.

The apparent process of this magic first forms countless tiny balls of light floating in the darkened area, which are then shot out as rays.

The attack appears like a shower of lasers, but the power of Meteor Line has no connection with the energy of the light. Even the amount of light is irrelevant.

The essence of the magic lies in forcing the redistribution of light, where the coordinates, for light to be in, are set as little balls, and lines are then drawn between them.

Anything in the path of the space the light passes through is modified as the light is transmitted: regardless of the hardness of the object, heat resistance, plasticity, or resilience, a hole is drilled through. Not even highly transparent glass holds an optical transparency of 100%, and cannot escape the event modification that “light has passed through” and therefore “a hole was made”.

Looking at the logic behind this magic, rather than the phenomenon itself, it can be concluded that the magic interferes with the structural information of the object via the distribution of light, directly vaporizing solids and liquids without affecting heat or pressure; in other words a type of decomposition magic which decomposes into gas. Since it’s defined as a “ray of distributed light”, it cannot be defended against via blocking, reflecting, or refracting. Since the light doesn’t come from any particular direction, it cannot be shielded against by magic either. Even if one were to cover themselves with a spherical shield in all directions, it cannot alter the movement of photons and the phenomena “light has become a line” will still be produced, resulting in a hole.

Just as it’s impossible to defend against by magic which shields against physical phenomena, it’s almost impossible to defend against Meteor Line with anti magic. Since it’s mediated via the physical phenomenon called light, preventing it purely via anti magic such as interference over an area is extremely difficult. If one’s interference strength in the single element “distribution of light” cannot exceed Maya’s, “Meteor Line” is unstoppable. As “distribution of light” is Maya’s innate magic, interfering with it is far too high a hurdle. And once the magic has been activated, even if one tries to cause interference in the area of effect, the phenomena rewriting effect that “light has moved” has already taken place.

Not even the Phalanx of the Juumonjis, which perfectly combines defense against physical forces with defense against magic, can hold against it. Due to that Maya stands invincible in a fight between magicians, and is regarded as one of the “strongest magicians in the world”.

However—as “Meteor Line” operates by indirectly affecting the structural information of an enclosed space, it decisively loses out to Tatsuya’s ability to directly interfere with structural information. The magical barrier through which light passes crafted by “Night” via interfering with the structural information is easily shattered by interference which directly affects the structural information.

“I can’t even say it’s unlikely I would be killed by him. But however much Tatsuya is able to betray the Yotsuba, he will never be able to betray Miyuki. And Miyuki will never oppose the Yotsuba.”

“Miyuki-sama is deeply dependent upon Tatsuya-dono though. Should the time ever come that Tatsuya stands against the Yotsuba, I cannot think that she would ever oppose him.”

His brow furrowed in concern, Hayama refuted the words of his mistress.

But there was no sign that Maya was disturbed.

“It’s fine. Even without brainwashing, it’s not particularly difficult to push someone’s thoughts in a particular direction. You don’t need an explanation do you, Hayama-san?”

There was pity in the smile now upon Maya’s lips.

“Miyuki will never be able to escape from the responsibility she has imposed upon herself. She was raised by my sister to be like that after all. And Tatsuya will never be able to do anything which causes Miyuki pain.”

“……But, in order for that.”

“Yes. It’s unfortunate for the other children who are candidates, but it cannot be anyone except Miyuki. So that Tatsuya, that monster, will not turn against us.”

“Miyuki-sama must receive the position at any cost then.”

“There’s no need to fret, Hayama-san. I have everything already planned out.”

Maya smiled broadly.

With a deep bow, Hayama left the room.

It’s commonly thought that the Yokohama Incident of 2095 was the extension of the invasion of Okinawa in 2092, and their subsequent defeat of three years ago (in other words, their “failed campaign”) — an attempt to redeem themselves.

However, for the events following the invasion of Yokohama to come to a close in the same way as the “Battle of Okinawa” can only be called the irony of history.





Chapter 16




August 11th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Battlefield

Tatsuya, accompanied by the Onna Airborne under the command of Kazama, had driven the invading enemy to the water’s edge.

Normally, it’d be “Tatsuya accompanied the Onna Airborne”.

However that single petite magician who stood alone at the head of a solitary infantry platoon, his form hidden beneath a full-faced helmet and Armored Suit as he annihilated the enemy, could only be seen as such by both friend and foe alike.

The battlefield was an utterly one-sided slaughter.

Yet at the same time, it lacked all the characteristics of a slaughter.

No blood sprayed.

No bodies flew.

The stench of burning flesh, the explosions capable of tearing men apart, were all absent.

The entire battlefield was dominated by an uncanny silence.

The bullets fired by the invaders, their grenades, portable rockets; all dissolved in the air as they flew towards the defenders. Shells, bombs, and missiles; all shared their fate.

The enemy soldiers still stubbornly resisting, still madly pulling their triggers also one by one blurred, warped; faded.

The soldiers following behind Tatsuya were no longer even firing now; they merely stared at the fantasy playing out before them.

Seeing their comrades disappear one after the other, the invading troops experienced the same disconcerting mockery of reality.

The instinctive fear which should have arisen from the sight of violent death was not stimulated, and despite being eaten away by unutterable fears, surrender did not cross their mind.

That was just what Tatsuya desired.

If the enemy had high level magicians on their side, they had not unilaterally been deployed yet. It didn’t have anything to do with the Japanese side, but rather could be said to have stemmed from carelessness following the success of the invaders’ initial attack.

—All of which was meaningless to Tatsuya.

Currently, his spirit was one of frenzy.

All hesitance towards death and destruction had been removed.

It was as if he no longer remembered murder as a taboo.

He killed and destroyed as easily as he walked.

Rather, he obliterated.

Even he could feel conflict from such wide reaching slaughter. But that conflict could not touch his immovable heart.

The sight of his sister on the brink of death had impacted him deeply to the core.

The moment one passed that threshold, his magic was as helpless as anything else. It was the first time he had attempted “Regrowth” on others, but from previous experience and the knowledge that his own flesh and another’s flesh were all similarly “matter” he knew that restoration was possible.

But not even his “Regrowth” could call someone back from death. Life and death was an irreversible cyclic process, the changing of state from “alive” to “dead” being purely intrinsic. “Regrowth” could restore a body back to a perfect state, but the dead do not come back to life. Such an inherent truth was clearer to none other than Tatsuya himself.

Even if the heart had already stopped, the brain shut down, the throat torn open, if that was the extent of their injuries then revival was still possible. Even an instantly fatal wound, as long as rebuilding the body and restarting the circulation of blood would have had even the faintest chance of resuscitating the person, his “Regrowth” could be said to give life to the dead.

But once the state of death had been established, he was helpless.

If he had not made it on time……that fear had been enough to drive even him into a panic. To Tatsuya, for whom not even his own death could induce “true fear” — more accurately, he had been deprived of such an emotion — the fear of losing Miyuki was all the more amplified for there being no other fears to temper him and shook him strongly, deeply, and utterly. However calm he appeared, he was currently seething with rage.

In the absence of any other emotions he was simply calmly, methodically retaliating without hesitation.

In a manner of speaking, it was a rational frenzy.

A madness dominated only by one purpose.

Allowing the enemy no surrender, his madness greedily devoured the lives of all within his path.



While the routed enemy frontlines could only be said to be in a state of collapse, their chain of command was yet intact.

The enemy commander, determining that holding a bridgehead was no longer tenable, ordered a retreat out to sea.

The invasion forces fought to be first into the landing craft on the beach.

To escape the grasp of the devil even now advancing towards them step by step.

Not knowing that there also, Death awaited them with his scythe held high.

Faced with the sight of the enemy fleeing and no longer counterattacking, Tatsuya halted.

Suddenly remembering their role, the Onna Airborne assumed formation and prepared to shoot.

Yet faster than the command “fire!” could be given, Tatsuya activated his “power”.

It’s not that there aren’t magicians who would emit enough interference for it to be visible.

A truly excellent magician uses no more force than absolutely necessary to achieve the desired event modification without otherwise altering the “world”, while a magician with equal power yet inferior skill will occasionally cause unintentional event modifications from time to time. The side effects in this instance however were purely physical.

The soldiers pushing into the small amphibious assault crafts, as well as the boats themselves disintegrated and scattered into the air. The visible distortion was caused by the boats’ sudden evaporation, forming gaseous layers of different densities and refracting light.

The soldiers who had been scrambling to board the next craft stopped moving.

The patter of water could be heard as they threw their weapons into the sea.

The sound spread, as if a chain reaction.

A white flag was raised.

By raising the naval flag of the Great Asian Alliance at the same time, they were evidently banking on protective status as POW[19]s.

Behind Tatsuya, instead of the order to shoot, the order to hold fire was given instead.

Seeing that, Tatsuya raised his right hand towards the white flag.

“Stop it, you fool!”

A hand appeared along with the voice.

In order to escape that hand, Tatsuya lowered his arm and twisted around.

However his right arm, which should have escaped, was firmly gripped by another hand sprouting from the left.

“The enemy does not intend to fight any further!”

He knew that perfectly well without being told.

He could not see the face of his captor due to the full face helmet, but it was a voice he had not heard before.

At the least, it wasn’t Captain Kazama or Lieutenant Sanada.

In any case had Kazama attempted at any point to restrain him, Tatsuya would have had no intention of sparing the enemy regardless.

Up to if the enemy were indeed trying to surrender, exterminating the enemy before a formal surrender was established and hostilities properly ceased.

Fortunately, there were still enemies who held weapons in their hands.

“I said stop!”

But Tatsuya was unable to pull the trigger on his CAD.

His vision suddenly spun around, and he lost the target coordinates for decomposition.

He felt a strong impact on his back.

He realised that he had been thrown.

He immediately made to rise, and just as quickly realised that he was already being held down.

“Any more at this point would be mere butchery. I won’t allow it.”

A handgun was held to the nose of his helmet.

“Calm yourself Special Lieutenant, Yanagi, stow that gun.”

Tatsuya recognised the voice this time. He also recalled the designation “Special Lieutenant”. Should the need arise to mobilise civilians into actual combat, it was a rank given for the sake of convenience. The voice belonged to none other than Captain Kazama.

“Special Lieutenant, do you remember the conditions for your mobilisation?”

Naturally, he knew those too.

His head, previously boiling, cooled down a little.

His battle lust subsided, and with it the desire to slaughter and destroy.

“Understood.”

With that reply he showed that he had unhooked his finger from the trigger of his CAD, as Yanagi removed the knee he had pressed to Tatsuya’s back.




At the surrender of the landing force and their disarmament relief began to spread not only amongst Kazama’s troops but also amongst the soldiers sent to intercept them; despite being understandable, it proved to be premature.

“A message from HQ!”

A communications officer rushed over to Kazama. His face, the helmet removed, was pale.

“A detachment of the enemy fleet is approaching from Aguni! Two high speed cruisers, and four destroyers!

It’s too late for interception! Their artillery is estimated to come into range in 20 minutes! We have to get away from the coast as fast as possible!”

His articulation was rather excitable, but that was understandable given the situation.

“Get me a communicator.”

In contrast, Kazama gave his order in subdued tones.

“Sir!”

The soldier’s voice was far louder than necessary.

The disarmed soldiers, holding their breath, looked at their captain. That none of them attempted to make a break for it was a disappointment to Tatsuya. It may have been that due to his undisguised bloodlust, none of the enemy soldiers were feeling particularly enthusiastic about taking their chances.

“This is Kazama. Could some torpedo boats……no antiship aircraft are available either? What shall we do with the POWs then?……Understood.”

Putting down the communicator, Kazama took a deep breath.

“In 20 minutes time, this area will fall within range of enemy guns! All units take charge of the prisoners, and evacuate inland!”

Tatsuya couldn’t believe his ears.

With no transports, and the number of prisoners far outnumbering their own troops, just how did he intend to make enough progress in 20 minutes?

Kazama’s face, with his helmet removed, showed no sign of agitation. His determined visage was a mask of iron.

Even without ESP however, it was evident that he found the order to move the prisoners a bitter pill to swallow.

“Special Lieutenant, return to base for now.”

That terse instruction, given in that emotionless voice only served to support Tatsuya’s conclusion.

Or at the least, he thought so.

He had said return, but he meant escape.

“Do you know the exact positions of the enemy cruisers?”

Instead of complying with Kazama’s instructions, Tatsuya inquired with his helmet still on.

“We do indeed, but……Sanada!”

But why, Kazama didn’t ask.

Rather, he called over the one carrying the tactical information terminal.

“I’m linked to our maritime radar. Shall I transfer it to our Special Lieutenant’s visor?”

“Before that.”

Tatsuya interrupted between Sanada’s question to Kazama.

“Did you bring the armament device with the extended range sequences you showed me on that day?”

Sanada raised his visor, and exchanged a glance with Kazama.

Kazama nodded, and Sanada looked back at Tatsuya.

“I don’t have it here, but if we have it lifted in by heli it can be here within five minutes”

“Please bring it as soon as possible.”

At the latest, Sanada would have said, but Tatsuya cut him off with rather typically boyish haste.

Tatsuya then turned to Kazama, pulled out a wired communications line from his still fully enclosed helmet, and held it out.

Kazama merely raised his eyebrows but without a word put his own helmet back on, then connected them by plugging the wire into his terminal.

“I have a way to destroy those ships.”

This secret talk he had been approached with in the presence of his subordinates began with a bombshell.

“However, I don’t wish for it to be seen by the troops. Could you leave Lieutenant Sanada’s device here, then move everyone out?”

Kazama could not see Tatsuya’s expression.

Voices didn’t carry over very well along the wired communicator either.

All he had to judge with was tone, and the slight association he had had.

“……Very well. However, Sanada and I will remain here.”

“……Understood.”

How will you command the withdrawing soldiers then? Tatsuya thought, but immediately put out of his mind as none of his concern.

As Kazama gave the order to pull out, giving command to the officer who had restrained Tatsuya before, Tatsuya awaited the arrival of the armament device.




The hectic withdrawal of the interception troops was displayed at large upon the screens in the Command and Control Center.

Naturally, it was being viewed by Miyuki and co as well.

As the soldiers began to fall back with their prisoners in tow, three figures showed no signs of moving.

Murmurs ran through the command room. Who are those idiots, and such could be clearly heard even through the glass.

Seeing the video feed, Miyuki gasped.

One of the three was none other than her brother.

She knew without having to ask. Without having to check the ID signal. Even though his face was hidden behind a visor, she could tell simply from his size.

The operators were frantically repeating into their communicators requests for evacuation. An officer wearing the rank insignia of Major was desperately calling for reinforcements from a base somewhere — probably Kyushu — to come help them.

Miyuki knew that Sakurai, just by watching her clench her teeth as she stared at that scene understood what she wanted to do, what she wanted to say, and in knowing so took her hand.

She thought that was pathetic.

Even though she was just 12, she was unable to form the words she truly wanted to speak. The words “go help my brother”, words which would have come naturally to any normal selfish person.

Sakurai did not know why Tatsuya had remained in that place.

However, she could hazard a guess.

He probably had a way to deal with that fleet of approaching enemy ships.

Under normal circumstances that would be impossible, but for him, a magician who was a direct descendant of the Yotsuba and who excelled in certain areas, it was suddenly not unthinkable.

Because even though he could not use normal magic, he had shown that he was capable of insane feats such as magic capable of wholly restoring the human body — although that was not true magic according to Miya — and demonstrated it upon Sakurai herself.

It was indisputable however that as a “magician” he was sorely lacking. If he were to simply become a combat magician as he was now, he would never be able to overcome barriers that people normally took for granted.

Not to mention the bombs and bullets he had erased earlier, whether individually or separately, had all needed to be identified first and evidently pushed him to his limits just disabling the enemy attacks. She didn’t know how, and did indeed consider it an amazing skill, but if Tatsuya did have a magic capable of reaching warships dozens of kilometers away — and if he did, that would cross into the realm of Strategic class magic — in the process of casting, he would not be able to protect himself in the same way as before.

“Madam, I have a request.”

The moment she thought that, without herself being aware of it, those words were already tumbling from her lips.

“What is it?”

Despite the suddenness of it all, Miya’s voice contained not a hint of surprise.

Her tone suggested it was almost as if she already knew what Sakurai’s “request” was.

“I’d like to go to Tatsuya-kun.”

Until a moment ago Miyuki had been glued to the screen; yet at this she forcefully wrenched her head around.

Her eyes, staring at Sakurai, were wide open.

“That is to say you wish to go, right now, over there?”

Miya’s voice retained its calm tone.

Her ability was meant to entail mental interference, not mind reading.

Could it be that……Sakurai shook such convenient useless thoughts out of her head.

“Yes.”

“Honami, even though you are meant to be my guardian?”

Within that was the implication, “and yet you intend to leave me?”.

At Miya’s question, Sakurai had no answer.

“……I’m―”

“Well, I suppose it’s fine.”

Sakurai had been about to say “I’m sorry”, an apology which could have been taken either way, yet before that Miya nodded.

“If those enemy ships are left to be, there’s no telling how much longer this base will remain safe. Tatsuya intends to try do something about them, so go help him.”

“Huh?”

That exclamation was reflexive.

Somehow, it seemed Miya knew what it was Tatsuya was about to attempt. Then again, it might be only natural considering she was his mother.

“Whilst it’s possible in theory it’s never been done in practice, yet he’s thought of it anyway. His intelligence is one of his strong points after all.”

However you looked at it, those were words of praise.

In spite of everything, a mother will still always be capable of boasting in her child, Sakurai thought.

“Thank you.”

I’d like to believe so, she thought, as she bowed politely.




In the previous world war which had spanned two decades, the primary armament of ships had shifted from missiles to Fleming launchers. (Initially these had been called railguns, but as their size increased their names changed.)

Modern shelling then is a continuous bombardment from these Fleming launchers. The rate of fire is overwhelmingly superior to that of gunpowder based weapons, and since there’s no need to include propellant or propulsion systems they have far more destructive capacity than missiles. However, their range was no better than, or in some cases inferior to, that of traditional naval guns.

Fleming launchers emphasize rate of fire, and the recoil from extending their range whilst attempting to maintain that rate would lead to significant adverse effects on the hull which cannot be ignored.

Thus the ground attack power of a state-of-the-art modern warship is said to be over 10 times more effective than that of ships a century ago. Within the range of Fleming launchers, even a single ship can turn entire districts into a sea of flames.

The launchers are effective not only against urban areas, but also fortifications. If the two cruisers began raining fire, the average magician wouldn’t stand a chance.

Tatsuya knew it was a race against time. He took the magazine out from the range expanding armament device, that large sniper rifle with the built-in specialized CAD, and quickly began ejecting the bullets.

He clasped the bullets in his hands one by one, as if praying, then reloaded them back into the magazine.

Looking on, Kazama and Sanada had no idea what he was doing. They could faintly feel that powerful magic was at work, but as to exactly what techniques were being applied, they could not begin to guess.

It wouldn’t just have been them who were stumped. If any magician could see through what Tatsuya was doing at this moment, they would be truly exceptional in every sense of the word.

What Tatsuya was doing was decomposing each bullet, then recreating it anew.

By the time he had completed that procedure with each bullet, two minutes had passed.

“Time until enemy ships come within range: ten minutes.”

As Tatsuya finished up the preparations on the armament device, Sanada informed him of the grace period left.

“The ships are almost 30 kilometers west off the coast……can it reach?”

“We’ll just have to see.”

That was the only answer Tatsuya had to Sanada’s question as he set the armament device’s elevation to 45 degrees.

Wind aside, that was the greatest range it would be possible to achieve.

In that position, Tatsuya activated the sequence.

From the muzzle, a pipe shaped virtual area began to radiate outwards.

This was the magic zone which would accelerate any object passing through.

Despite the short time of the area’s creation, Sanada nodded with satisfaction at the size the area had expanded to.

The longer the length of the virtual area the longer the acceleration effect would be applied, and the greater the range extension. With the length it had now reached, 30 km might just be within their grasp.

But that was not the only magic Tatsuya applied.

Beyond the acceleration magic zone, yet another virtual area was taking shape.

“What in the……!?”

The acceleration magic zone was comprised of three action processes.

The reduction in inertial mass of anything entering the area.

An increase in speed.

Then the undoing of the initial process.

Just how far and how fast the first step could be achieved was dependent on the magician.

The area Tatsuya was applying now followed the same principles.

However this time the initial change in inertial mass was set to positive, the speed magnification remained the same, and the process to restore inertial mass had been disabled.

In other words the region Tatsuya added had taken the acceleration magic Sanada designed and completely rearranged it into a region for increasing inertial mass instead.

All on the fly.

“I can’t believe it……”

Sanada’s murmur was drowned out by the boom of the sniper rifle.

Tatsuya’s eyes seemed to chase that supersonic bullet which should never have been seen.

At length he shook his head, disappointed.

“……It’s no good. It could only reach 20 km.”

Just how had he followed its trajectory?

While he sounded indifferent, he must have been disappointed deep down. Perhaps he was berating himself for his own weakness.

“We can only wait for them to come within 20 km.”

Hearing that, Sanada paled.

“But by then, we’ll be within range of enemy fire as well!”

The effective range of cruiser mounted Fleming launchers is somewhere around 15-20 km. A launcher’s range is always dependent upon just how well the ship can handle the recoil, meaning range is limited by the size and shape of the ship; regardless of differences in manufacturer, range can almost always be predicted just by the class of ship.

20 km and under would definitely fall within range.

“I know. Both of you, please head back to the base. From here, I can handle things by myself.”

“Don’t say such foolish things! You’re coming as well.”

This was the place the enemy had selected as a bridgehead, in other words; it was where the conflict would be decided.

It was almost certain the enemy would launch the decisive attack here.

If one couldn’t engage the enemy ships from beyond their range, once a shootout began the chances of survival here approached nil.

“If the enemy ships are not brought down, the base would be in danger.”

Along with his family, still inside.

“Then at the least, move from here.”

Both of them understood perfectly well what it was Tatsuya was concerned about, what it was he wanted to protect.

“No good. There’s no more time to look for another vantage point.”

However he rejected Sanada’s proposal, for reasons known only to himself.

“Could we possibly intercept?”

Listening silently in to the conversation between the two until now, Kazama spoke up in a dejected tone.

“Impossible.”

The answer was just as expected, and nothing more.

“Then, we will remain here.”

What was unexpected was the reply.

To Tatsuya, Kazama’s response just now was inconceivable.

“……If I fail, you would become collateral damage.”

“There is no plan which is without fail, and there is no battlefield without the danger of death. While victory and defeat may be decided by tacticians, living and dying will always be decided by soldiers.”

Calmly, without hubris, Kazama said so.

That famous passage, from the Hagakure[20], was all that was needed to be said.



Offshore, plumes of water erupted.

The enemy was ranging their guns.

With nothing left to say Tatsuya, Kazama, and Sanada remained silent.

The exact position of the enemy was being transmitted into Tatsuya’s visor.

Wind speed, direction, and other factors which would affect shots scrolled by in strings of numbers.

Tatsuya positioned the armament device.

A stance for trajectory — prioritising distance, and leaving hits to lucky chance.

Allowing for bullet drop and flight time, the enemy was already within range.

Tatsuya triggered the virtual magic areas, and then pulled the trigger four times in succession.

Each time he moved the muzzle slightly, compensating for error due to the ever shifting wind.

In the first place, this had been a shot without much hope. However much chance favoured them, the odds would still fall upon the enemy at best. –He had done this willingly with that knowledge from the beginning.

Tatsuya followed the flight of the four bullets in his head.

To be precise his awareness, through the processing of his subconscious, chased the data of the bullets in the dimension of information.



By his own hands, using the magic he alone could wield, he had decomposed then rebuilt the bullets.

However far away they flew, he would not lose sight of their information structure.

Of the four shots he had fired, Tatsuya received the information that one of the bullets had fallen into the center of the enemy fleet.



Tatsuya tracked the exact position of that bullet with everything he had.

Kazama and Sanada, aware that Tatsuya was focusing on some large scale magic distanced themselves so as to not disturb his concentration.

All that was left for them to do was what they could with their own magic.

The enemy had already found their range.

The next salvo then, was right on target.

Firing from a lower ballistic trajectory than Tatsuya had, their fire arrived before Tatsuya’s.

As a user of Ancient magic, Kazama’s ability to interfere with objective structures was not high. Rather, it was low.

And Sanada, who technically wasn’t even a magician but rather a magic engineer, had high objective interference yet lacked speed.

At this rate, before Tatsuya could destroy the enemy fleet, this place would be—

“I’ll cover you!”

As ordinance fell like rain, a figure burst through speeding in on a motorbike.

The rider, clad in a female Armored Suit, flung away the bike as blazing Psion light erupted from her body.

Concentrating as he was on his magic a corner of Tatsuya’s heart felt surprise at hearing that voice, yet gladness.

Surprise that Sakurai had left his mother.

And gladness because he knew that under her mighty shield, he could focus on his own magic without fear.

Augmented Magician, “Sakura” series.

Their characteristic was defensive magic against powerful objective and heat based attacks.

While they could not use highly technical multi-spectrum magic such as the Juumonji’s “Phalanx”, in the single field of defense against objective heat based attacks they were unrivaled in Japan.

And amongst them, Sakurai Honami showed exceedingly gifted performance.

It was because of that she was chosen to protect the one precious magician who alone was capable of mental structure interference magic, Yotsuba Miya.

The shells, aimed dead on, instead dropped into the sea.

Not a single shot was able to reach land anymore.

A magic which crippled momentum was being invoked in rapid succession several hundred meters offshore.

As he watched that spectacle with his naked eyes, his minds eye roving over the sky found the bullet in the midst of the enemy fleet.

Tatsuya stretched out his right hand towards the west, and forcibly unclenched his palm.



The bullet broke down into energy.

In that moment, the mass conversion magic “Material Burst” was used in anger for the first time.

Beyond the horizon, a flash ignited.

The overcast sky reflected dazzling light.

Although sunset was yet far off, a shining star blazed on the Western sea.

A roar reverberated. There would be none here who mistook it for the sound of thunder.

With no staggering, all the fuel and explosives on board the ships had ignited as one.

The shelling ceased.





An eerie rumbling approached.

“Tsunami! Take cover!”

As he shouted, Kazama picked up Sakurai, who had suddenly collapsed powerless upon the ground, and began running.

Sanada, now upon the bike, swerved to line up beside him.

Tatsuya sat upon the tandem seat.

Still running and carrying Sakurai, Kazama leapt.

With theatrical acrobatics, he came to stand upon the handlebars. Rather, this went far beyond mere acrobatics.

It couldn’t be said that military bikes lacked horsepower, as the clearly overloaded bike valiantly powered on.



As storms raged and waves lashed across the horizon, Tatsuya knelt at the top of a hill.

Before him lay the exhausted figure of Sakurai.

Tatsuya’s face, with the helmet removed, was unmistakably filled with grief.

“……It’s alright, Tatsuya-kun. This is life after all.”

Helpless in the face of life which could not be saved, crushed by emotions that he should have lost; to him Sakurai extended a weak, yet serene smile.

“It’s not your fault. For Augmented magicians like us, it’s only natural that our life would run out sometime.”

That’s wrong, Tatsuya wanted to scream.

While it was true that Augmented magicians had unstable lifespans compared to the general public, her current condition was without a doubt due to the sheer stress of using large quantities of magic continuously over such a short period of time. Even for a “Sakura” series, the strain of denying the nonstop volley of so many guns was too much to bear.

However, Sakurai would not want him to say that.

Knowing so, he could only grit his teeth.

“Truly, it’s not your fault. From birth it was my role to be a shield, and it’s simply that today that role ends.”

But it seemed that Sakurai could tell Tatsuya’s thoughts.

“That is something that I decided, not because I was ordered, but of my own free will.”

Tatsuya frantically tried using “Regrowth”, but soon realised it was futile.

Even though he could rewind material matter, his power was helpless to turn back the clock of life.

“Won’t you let go?”

Sakurai murmured to Tatsuya in a sweet voice.

“I, who never once had the chance to freely choose in my life, am finally free to choose how I die. I won’t let this chance pass. I can finally choose to die not as a man-made tool, but as a person.”

Never in his dreams had Tatsuya thought Sakurai carried such darkness in her heart.

But unexpectedly even to him, there was no surprise.

“So, won’t you let me go?”

At Sakurai’s words, Tatsuya could only nod silently.

With a look of peace, Sakurai closed her eyes.

Gradually, she stopped breathing.

Next to them, Sanada began to chant sutras.

Kazama placed a hand on Tatsuya’s shoulder.

While carrying that hand, Tatsuya stood up.

There were no tears in his eyes.

Curiously, the feelings of sorrow had lifted from Tatsuya’s heart.

Hearing Sakurai Honami’s last words, he was convinced there was no need to grieve.

—Tatsuya at that time did not know that it was actually possible to convince grief away, and that it would be the one time he would do so.





Chapter 17




November 6th, AD 2095 / Yotsuba Main House - Sunroom

Possibly because there have been a lot incidents today that have reminded him of the events of three years ago.

Tatsuya thought about Sakurai Honami, who he hadn’t thought about in a long time.

The memories were laced with regret.

Nevertheless, he knew he could do nothing more than regret and understand.

Besides, if she hadn’t sacrificed herself, Tatsuya might not have considered polishing his magic combat skills or doing anything else with the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.

This last time he had been able to end it without anyone else being sacrificed.

His experiences three years ago had not been in vain. Tatsuya could comfort himself with that.

And he dedicated a silent prayer deep in his heart to the woman who nobly sacrificed herself as a shield three years ago.

—That was probably what made the shock unreasonably large.

Upon sight of the face of the girl holding the tea and cakes, Tatsuya came dangerously close to raising his voice.

“…Would you like something?”

“No, thank you.”

The one who was questioned by that girl was Miyuki.

Her shock was showing in a more extreme fashion that Tatsuya’s.

That was not unreasonable.

The face of the girl in the servant’s uniform and Sakurai Honami’s were like two peas in a pod.



The girl and her fellow servant had not quite left when Maya showed herself in the sunroom.

Hayama did not accompany her.

This gathering was probably to be private.

Tatsuya was permitted to take a seat for that same reason.

“What is it Miyuki-san? You look like something gave you a shock, but…”

As she lowered herself to sit, Maya questioned Miyuki with a worried expression.

She appeared to be a different person than the one who had had a confrontation with Tatsuya; it was the normal face of Yotsuba Maya.

“No…Oba-sama, that girl just now?”

“Ah, Minami-chan?”

When she heard Miyuki’s question, Maya gave a slight nod of understanding.

“Her name is Sakurai Minami. A second generation Sakura series, the girl is more than the genetic niece of the Guardian who served your mother, Sakurai Honami.”

By second generation she meant a person who had a genetically modified magician as a parent.

And the phrase “more than the genetic niece” probably meant that Honami and the girl’s mother who also possesses a first generation modified body have the same DNA.

That was the reason their features were the spitting image of each other.

“The girl is already quite skilled. I think her potential abilities are on par with the Saegusa twins. I have been thinking of training her to become Miyuki-san’s Guardian sometime in the future. Since once she becomes an adult there will be situations where a female guard is necessary.”

Miyuki by and large understood Maya’s official point.

Certainly, for Miyuki who is female to have only a male, Tatsuya, as guard causes inconvenient situations.

However, just a little while ago, Tatsuya was informed of Maya’s true purpose; fortifying an additional layer of protection against some possible moment in the future of havoc and destruction. If he was being told to use a girl with the same face as “Her” as a tool, then this could only end in conflict.

—At that moment, he had no way of predicting the havoc and destruction to come.





Chapter 18




August 17th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Naha Airport

While listening to the announcements of plane arrivals and departures, I was recalling the events of six days ago.

After Sakurai-san went to be Onii-sama’s guard, the person who manipulated the screen for us disappeared; so I could only see what happened next from the images streaming on the news.

Suddenly, at the water line a light brighter than the sun erupted.

In the middle of that light, the enemy ship vanished.

The transformed terrain of the beach was washed by breaking waves.

It was an anthem of victory.

That was the official report shared with us and the world in general afterward.

What was not shared with the world is the truth known only to us, what we were told is that the light that destroyed the enemy was made by the power of Onii-sama.

The transformation of mass into energy, the enormous energy that burned everything into nothing is the strategic class magic “Material Burst” wielded by a strategic class magician. That indeed is the true power of Onii-sama, the name of its true form.

The one hailed as a hero for driving away the enemy is Onii-sama.

And also the sad event only we know of.

Afterward, Sakurai-san never returned.

At the joint funeral service for the victims, the cremated remains of Sakurai-san were in accordance with her will completely scattered into the ocean.

The one who returned Sakurai-san to Mother Ocean was Onii-sama.

Onii-sama never showed pain in his face.

He gently comforted me who broke down crying.

Onii-sama might not be sad. Or else it might be that he could not become sad.

No, it does not matter which one it is.

Because I have decided.

While watching Sakurai-san become ashes, I had an insight.

I, at that time, had died once.

I lost the life that Okaa-sama gave me; I received a new life from Onii-sama.

Therefore, all that I am belongs to Onii-sama.

“Miyuki, it is about time to get inside.”

“Yes, Onii-sama.”

When Onii-sama called out to me, I stood up off of the sofa in the lounge.

Okaa-sama no longer makes a face when I refer to him as “Onii-sama”. The truth is that I think it probably still pains her. However, I no longer worry about Okaa-sama’s feelings concerning it.

As usual, Onii-sama is handling all of our luggage and only he is in commercial class, but that no longer troubles me.

Because after all Onii-sama says that he prefers it.

Because Onii-sama’s wishes are absolute.

I took the hand of Okaa-sama who is not in perfect physical condition and trailed after Onii-sama.

For now, there are still words that are not spoken. Words that cannot be spoken.

Nevertheless, I have already decided.



—Onii-sama, no matter where you go, no matter how far; I, Miyuki, am going with you—





Untouchable The Nightmare of 2062




The eldest daughter of the Yotsuba Clan, Yotsuba Miya, gazed at the western sky from the window of her own room with her childish face clouded. She is currently twelve years old. She just became a middle school student this April, yet the anguish on her face is unsuited for her age.

She is fretting about her younger twin sister, whose whereabouts are unknown, Yotsuba Maya. Three days before, she was kidnapped by anonymous perpetrators in Taipei when she was visiting as part of a cultural exchange program sponsored by the Asian branch of the International Magic Federation. That this was not a disappearance due to unknown reasons, but rather, a violent abduction, was obvious to anyone. Because Saegusa Koichi, who was visiting Taipei with Maya, is suffering from lacerations and broken bones in his right hand and right leg and the loss of his right eye due to his battle during the kidnapping.

Koichi’s condition is still worrisome. After all, Koichi is not only her younger sister’s boyfriend, but also her fiancé. Rather than Koichi, who was severely injured while escaping the abductor’s grasp, her worries were naturally more concentrated on Maya, who the kidnappers had made off with. To be honest, she was gripped more by feelings of anger and bitterness toward Koichi than feelings of worry. He brazenly returned alone from his cowardice while her sister was taken away.

She understood that it was not Koichi’s fault. To require such a thing from a mere fourteen-year old boy was cruel and, from looking at the situation, the criminals placed more importance on Maya. It could be said that Koichi got entangled in Maya’s kidnapping and was left with one eye for all eternity. Nevertheless, she was not at an age where reason could overcome emotion. Since the identity of the abductors had not been attained yet, it was all she could do to keep her anger from bursting free.

Unexpectedly, she felt a fuss in the corridor. Quicker than a knock could be made, Miya turned toward the door.

“Pardon me.”

The voice of Maya’s personal maid trembled with such violence as it passed through the door — it seemed like she was shrieking. These past three days, panicked voices and excited voices could be heard throughout the mansion, but there was something a little different about this tone compared to the others — something like hope was mixed in it.

“Please enter.”

As a reply, Miya opened the door in the twinkling of an eye. Even so, she did not do anything as vulgar as rushing into the crowd of servants employed by the Yotsuba family in the room. Before crossing the frame of the doorway, she vigorously shook her body. Still, impatience could not be kept off her face and her feelings of impatience returned at the same time.

“Maya-sama has been rescued!”

Upon hearing those words, Miya’s mind went blank. Miya could not remember what she did after that. When she became aware of herself again, she was approaching the head of the Yotsuba Family, her father, Yotsuba Genzou.

“Otou-sama! I have been told that Maya has been found; is it true!?”

In the conference room that the family elders use for meetings, Miya interrogated her father under the intent gazes of the aunts, uncles, and other elder relatives.

“It’s true. I have just received word from Juuzou.”

“From Oji-sama of the Kuroba?”

As she heard that, an expression of pure relief arose on Miya’s face. Kuroba is the branch family in charge of supervising the intelligence division of the Yotsuba Clan. Kuroba Juuzou, in addition to being the head of that branch family, is Genzou’s brother in law. If word had come from Juuzou, then there could be no room for doubt.

Even so, Miya soon found a reason to feel indignant, and once again she confronted her father.

“Why was I not informed!”

“I don’t understand what you mean. Didn’t I just inform you as soon as possible?”

“Do not try to fool me please! I have been told that Maya was rescued today, which means that as of yesterday at the very latest, you probably knew the criminal’s true identity! Why did you not tell me this!?”

“Because telling you would be meaningless.”

“Wha…!?”

“Telling you would’ve been meaningless. Or do you believe that you would’ve been able to help save Maya?”

“I would have…”

Miya snapped her mouth shut with regret. Certainly, she was still a child; Miya understood that herself. Even if she had been told where Maya was being held, she could have done nothing. Nevertheless due to her blood ties, she felt that she should have been told the whereabouts of her younger sister, right? A whirlpool of bile swirled within Miya’s heart.

“I believed not telling you was for the best.”

However with her father’s next words, the bile was pushed aside by a premonition of dark clouds on the horizon.

“Although I do not wish to tell you this, Miya, brace yourself.”

It seemed like he had something awful to relate to her. Something terrible had happened to Maya. Miya’s heart was no longer trembling from a premonition but from a conviction. An impulse to cover her ears assailed Miya’s heart but, as her father told her to, she girded her nerves and prepared herself for her father’s next words.

“Maya was found in Quanzhou[21].”

“Dahan[22]’s…”

Dahan is a portion of the southern half of China that, after the world was beset by a firestorm of outbreaks of warfare, was quickly able to break away and establish itself as an independent nation. The Great Asian Alliance has been dominating the northern part of China continent and the Korean peninsula since two years before, and has taken possession of Tsushima[23] half a year ago. Since then Japan and Dahan, although not formal allies, had shared a common enemy in the Great Asian Alliance and had cooperated militarily.

“Maya had been imprisoned in a research laboratory placed in Quanzhou that is a subdivision of the Kunlunfang Institute[24].”

Miya’s face quickly paled. Kunlunfang Institute is Dahan’s magician development group. The evil rumors of that place would not die any more than the ones about The Fourth Institute which the Yotsuba are now the actual masters of, but are entirely different. The content of those rumors with regards to females is so bad that Miya could not bear to hear them fully.

“Maya is suffering from deep wounds. The damage to her body is also severe, but I am more worried about the wounds to her spirit…”

The tone of Genzou’s voice, which until then had been level while he spoke, went wild. Sounds similar to teeth grinding in anger and cries of pain were mixed in his words. A rage that could not be appeased by teeth grinding, a sorrow that howling in pain would not abate.

That prompted in Miya the feeling that the worst was yet to come.

“Maya has been used as a human guinea pig for experimentation.”

“How terrible!?”

“It was an experiment in magician manufacturing. It was not merely a scientific experiment. The truth is—”

“That’s enough!”

No matter how prepared she had decided to be, any more than this would be unbearable for Miya. To hear any more of what happened to her younger sister would be too much.

She glared at her father with eyes full of tears. Miya widened her eyes and let tears flow from both eyes.

From both of her father’s hands, blood was flowing from his own fingernails which he was digging into his own flesh.

Miya averted her face. After she did so, she saw her uncle’s face. Fury swirled in her uncle’s eyes. She looked at the opposite side. The people who are cousin to her father housed raging hatred in their pupils.

“Miya, there is something only you can do.”

“—Yes.”

Miya took numerous deep breaths to calm herself. Everyone is outraged on her younger sister’s behalf. It was a minor balm, but it allowed herself to recover her sanity.

“Maya is locked inside herself. While her eyes are open, she does not respond to anyone’s voice. She does nothing out of her own will, she does not even respond when we treat her wounds.”

Miya firmly ground her back molars. She did so to hold back the urge to scream.

“Miya, take away everything she felt for the past three days from Maya’s mind with your magic.”

Miya closed her eyes and took one huge deep breath.

“If it is something that can be done, I believe it is something I too wish to do.”

Miya’s voice was flat with little emotion in it. By crushing her feelings, Miya was finally able to voice a reply.

“But, my magic is manipulation of the structure of self. There is no way to take away memories by changing the structure of self.”

She had no power to take away memories.

“Not take away her memories. If she was aware that her memories were taken, I doubt she could maintain her sanity. What we would have in our midst would be like a ticking bomb that could go off at any time.”

Genzou also understood that Miya could not wipe out memories. Still, he ordered her to do it.

“Don’t take away the memories, separate the feelings from the memories. The memories of things people have done themselves naturally have emotions attached to them. Reconstruct ‘the experiential memories’ into ‘informational memories’.”

Don’t take away the memory, take away the sense of reality from it.

“But Otou-sama, I cannot do such a precise operation. Although I could transmute all ‘the experiential memories’ Maya possesses into ‘informational memories’, reconstructing only those three days into ‘informational memories’… manipulating ‘memory’ in such a way is something that is impossible for me.”

Miya looked away as she answered. The rightness of what her father ordered, Miya understood with an acuity beyond that of a child. For that reason, her inability to do so with her power vexed her.

“Then change all of Maya’s ‘experiences’ into ‘information’.”

“But that!?”

Miya stared at her father with disbelieving eyes. Nevertheless, Genzou did not flinch even a little from the utmost censure he received from his daughter.

“Miya, I understand your feelings. I myself am aware of the regret and guilt I will feel by taking away Maya’s recollections. Even so, the way things are, Maya’s spirit will definitely be destroyed.”

“…”

“Tomorrow Maya will arrive at this mansion. Look at the Maya who has returned to us, Miya, and decide. No matter what your decision is, I will bear all the responsibility.”

Miya bowed without a word and left her father’s presence.

In the conference room Miya left, Genzou remained there surrounded by the gazes of the clan who remained.

Everyone gave Genzou a nod of approval.

“Our adversary is the central administrative institute of Dahan’s magic research. Unlike the single Fourth Institute which we are the product of, it has numerous research laboratories, so the first problem is the difference in numbers.”

Genzou began with their definite disadvantages. Before Asia’s dissolution into North and South, the Kunlunfang Institute had been the nexus of all modern magic research on the continent. With the Kunlunfang Institute attached to Dahan, the Great Asian Alliance had lost almost all of its expertise in modern magic. For that reason, Dahan could stand toe to toe with the Great Asian Alliance despite its inferior resources. It could be said that the Kunlunfang Institute is the nucleus of Dahan’s military power.

“Even so, I cannot let the savagery directed at us to pass. Although we are weapons, we are not slaves. And I refuse to be livestock. We, ourselves, are the masters of the laboratory that produced us.”

As Genzou stopped speaking, all that were there again gave a nod of approval.

“This is a personal grudge. I am the parent of a daughter who has been defiled; this is my vengeance in order to cleanse my bitterness. Nevertheless, that is not all it is. I wish to show my mettle to the foolish ‘Nation’ who treats magicians like domesticated livestock.”

“Genzou-dono.”

The one who opened his mouth was the eldest of his generation of those assembled there, Genzou’s uncle.

“I do not consider this matter as Maya’s personal tragedy. With this incident, our entire clan of Yotsuba has been insulted right now; our honor has been sullied.”

“Itoko-dono[25].”

His female cousin, who was younger than him by a decade, was the next one who wished to orate.

“I, too, have a daughter; therefore, I too do not think of this as someone else’s business. My daughter is not even old enough to go to school, but when I think of my child’s future, I cannot overlook this meaningless tragedy.”

“We are weapons and assassins.”

A voice rang out from near the lowest ranks.

“For us to make an appeal to humanity would probably be a fool’s errand. No matter how selfish it is, make no mistake; those who dare to attack us can mock us from the depths of hell. But, you know that, don’t you!”

The gazes from the others contained understanding and approval.

“Command us, our Master! Grant to me a part in your honored daughter’s revenge!”

“Restrain yourself, Genzou-dono.”

That voice exploded from next to Genzou.

“A novice like you will end up dying a dog’s death. Aniue[26], first give me, your younger brother, your orders. I will show those ruffians of Asia hell.”

“Genzou-dono, our feelings are the same as yours.”

“Everyone who had anything to do with Maya’s abduction must die.”

“The magicians of Asia who acted as pawns for the rapist will be annihilated.”

“Please leave our government to me. I will silence those who chant about diplomacy and military cooperation.”

Genzou made a deep bow to all that had assembled in this place.

Then, he raised his head to proclaim.

“The enemy is the Kunlunfang institute and the Dahan government. We will eradicate our enemies with the full power of the Yotsuba.”




“… Maya… Maya.”

The voice is calling me. I feel as if I haven’t heard this voice in a really long time, but for some reason I did not feel as if I have been longing to hear the voice.

I open my eyes. The hospital room looked familiar, and if my memory is correct, that face belongs to my elder twin sister.

“Nee-san… this place is the treatment room in the Fourth Institute?”

At the first word from Maya’s mouth, Miya relaxed and, at the same time, her face became tearful.

“That’s correct, Maya. How do you feel? You don’t have a headache or anything like that, do you?”

Upon being questioned by her elder sister, Maya’s expression became suspicious.

“I don’t have… a headache. Both my mind and my memory are clear.”

As Maya spoke the words “my memory,” Miya’s face looked troubled.

Miya looked at Maya with fearful eyes, and Maya gazed back up at her with a face of amazement.

“Nee-san, I… have been raped.”

Maya related this blandly and Miya averted her eyes.

“And my body has been messed with all over. Even the inside of my body has been disturbed. There is no place in my entire body that has not been fouled.”

Miya struck her knees with both hands with a slapping sound. As if she was afraid that her body would get up off the stool and run away, and was restraining it from doing so.

“I remember all of it. Despite that, why, I wonder? It feels somewhat unreal. Like I am merely watching a movie, thinking things like horrible or pitiful even though it all happened to me.”

Miya could not raise her eyes.

“Nee-san.”

Maya did not take her eyes off her elder sister.

“What was done to me? Nee-san.”

“…Your memory has been transmuted.”

Perhaps she was finally resigned to the task, so Miya began to speak while gazing downward.

“Within the persona, there are various processes used to store memory. The memory of an individual person is not a single unit. Given that, the process for storing your own experiences and the way knowledge gained from texts and images accumulates into memory storage differ in form.”

“To me, this cannot be anything but conjecture, however… if Nee-san says so.”

Within the Yotsuba clan, this magic is Miya’s unique gift, self structure manipulation. Miya, who was able to change the structure of self, could sense how a self is structured. No one other than she could understand it, but it was certain that she understood it.

“I cannot peek inside the contents. What memory is stored where is something I cannot know. What is known to me is whether a stored memory is ‘experience’ or ‘knowledge’ only.”

“…And so?”

At this stage, Maya had a vague idea about what her elder sister wanted to say. Nevertheless, she was going to make Miya say it.

“Maya, I do not know what you experienced. But, I knew that your spirit would remain broken if I did not use magic. Therefore I—”

“Therefore Nee-san?”

Miya hesitated to speak. Because voicing it was unendurable. Even so, Maya demanded her sister tell her what her sister had done in her own words.

“…Your ‘experiences’ have been changed to ‘knowledge’. The memory storage of experience has been transmuted into memory storage of knowledge… the shape of your memory has been reconfigured.”

“I see…”

Maya whispered only those words.

There were no words denouncing Miya.

Miya timidly raised her head and Maya faced the opposite wall.

“All that I have been until now has become simple data.”

Her younger sister’s words pierced Miya’s core.

“My delights, my tempers, the moments of enjoyment, the moments of sorrow; all of them have become data…”

Despite what she heard, Miya could not make her escape from this place.

“Certainly, the memory of what was done to me was too much for me to bear. In that condition, my spirit was dead.”

“Maya…”

“Therefore, before the memory of that rape could kill me, my elder sister killed me.”

“Uh!?”

Miya grasped for air.

Maya was casting her eyes at Miya again.

“That’s what happened, right? A person is formed by their experiences. There is who I was, and there is who I am now.”

Miya tried to avert her eyes. Nevertheless, Maya’s stare would not allow that.

“Experience being changed to mere knowledge means that my past has changed to data. All that was within me of who I was until yesterday has vanished except for the me that remains.”

Maya’s gaze punctured deeply into Miya’s heart.

“The me I was until yesterday has been killed by my own elder sister.”

Miya stood up from the stool. Turned on her heel and ran for the door as fast as she could go.

To flee from Maya’s presence.

It was not something that could be apologized for.

It was also not something one would be thanked for.

They could not even share tears over it.

—The chance to restore the bond between these two people that had been severed on this day would not come for all eternity.




Half a year has passed since then. Day by day, the nightmare continues for the Kunlunfang Institute and the Dahan government.

In the course of a single night, all the employees and magicians attached to a laboratory would be strangled.

A military base would suddenly break out in fighting between fellow soldiers, with the last man standing shooting himself in the head and dying.

The building the government’s military liaison agency was moving into collapsed when one of their own military aircraft plunged into it. There were no survivors.

There were also administrative facilities for research where everyone in the building suffocated due to lack of oxygen. There was also awareness of incidents where everyone was stabbed to death. Politicians who were aware of the outbreak of the incidents traveled incognito for a secret assembly; that day, a rare congregation of Dahan’s leadership took place.

There was absolutely no clue to who the culprits were. Among the incidents, there certainly existed cases wherein the culprit had been killed, but no corpses remained. Traces of the culprits vanished without exception.

Without a doubt, it was a nightmare.

Exactly half a year from the first mysterious event, the nightmare revealed its form at last.

All the subdivisions and branch offices were quashed; all that remained was the main headquarters of the Kunlunfang Institute. The fortifications solidified by Dahan’s magicians were invaded by three magicians.

A mere three people. Against the three hundred stationed at the Kunlunfang Institute. Formerly, Dahan’s magic regiment had boasted a breadth of three thousand; death and desertion had reduced it until it was a mere tenth of what it was.

“My name is Yotsuba Genzou.”

The magicians guarding the main entrance were slain in the twinkling of an eye by the man in the prime of his life who introduced himself in Japanese.

The researchers and magicians assembled at the main branch, as well as the authorities finding shelter there, watched Genzou enter their view on the screen as one.

“In order to cleanse ourselves from our hatred of you, all of you will die. This is revenge for the future you took from my daughter.”

While Genzou spoke, he slashed a knife toward the camera.

The five thousand people who saw the image simultaneously patted their necks as a vision of their own heads being lopped off assaulted them, then sighed in relief as they found their heads still attached. When they timidly returned their gazes to the screen, there was no one there.

The research focus of the Fourth Institute that birthed the Yotsuba clan was “the endowment and improvement of magical abilities given by the mind’s structure for the usage of mind manipulation magic.” In order to fulfill this purpose, The Fourth Institute first gathered people whose lineage predisposed them to have mind manipulation power.

Among these people, some individuals were transformed into genuine super powered beings, while others remained no more than mere illusionist tricksters who could do no more than create heat haze like mirages. The magicians with strong mind manipulation abilities were picked out, strengthened, and had the primary field of their magic calculation area directly modified. That was the Fourth Institute’s accepted procedure for magician development.

The “Yotsuba” produced as a result inevitably descended from two types of magician lineages. One were those born with a mind manipulation ability that was strengthened. The other were those whose magic calculation areas were warped by a strong power. These two heritages stood side by side and mixed to form the “Yotsuba”. Even those who shared the same blood displayed the two traits randomly. For example, Miya inherited the traits of the former, and “Mind Structure Manipulation” is a form of mind manipulation magic that only she can use; Maya represented the latter, as she did not have any form of mind manipulation magic, but instead acquired a distinctive power from birth.

The three who have now infiltrated the Kunlunfang Institute each use a strong unique mind manipulation magic.

One was a user of human cognizance fixation magic. His magic used the five senses as a medium in order to get someone to “fixate on something,” which is what could be called planting a fixed idea. The time period this continued was 9 minutes. For example, he would do so to a witness who spotted a concealed person in a certain place. It did not matter if it was with the naked eye or through a camera; it did not matter if it was one person or a thousand. The information from the vision, “I see him,” allowed him to transmit his magic through any medium for nine minutes so no one doubted that “he has not moved from the shadow of that place.” Even though he leisurely left the shadow and crossed their line of sight, those trapped by his magic were caught up in the idea that he was hiding.

Even if a loud alarm rang, they would not connect that sound to him.

The other one was a user of magic that controlled a person’s will. The longest this could continue was one minute; the number of targeted individuals was seven people at the most, and the effect range was twelve meters. That he could not command the self infliction of wounds to those whose mind manipulation power exceeded his own was another limitation, but however temporary it was, when they fell under his technique, his victims inevitably could not resist his commands. In order to send commands, psion waves transmitted the general idea. It could overcome thick walls to work, and the barrier of language was also no problem. He took control from 10 seconds to 1 minute. Since the victims would reliably execute only a single command and there had been 2 examples recorded outside of Japan, the name of “One Command” had been stuck on this magic.

The pairing of these two’s magic easily resulted in their infiltration into the facility turned fortress. They purposely let themselves be caught by surveillance cameras and soon let an image of them fleeing be displayed. By doing so, the three infiltrators were giving the impression that aside from Genzou, the infiltrators had left the facility and were outside. And “One Command” was used on the guards who passed through the front door to order them to throw open the doors. Of course, once the guards opened the doors, they were finished. Suggestion was repeatedly used for disposal. The two of them had a time limit of 9 minutes to reach their target location, the guard control room, a limit which was a struggle for the pair to make.

Next, the pair commenced their work. Due to their possession of powerful mental manipulation magic abilities, they did not possess more than the ordinary physical phenomenon manipulating magic from their four genetic lineages. While advancing upon the magicians defending the laboratory for nine minutes wore down their magic, it was certain that whether their enemies were many or few, mere words would not deceive them.

They directly wrote into the brains — to be accurate, they transmitted electrical signals to the brain which gave the mind data directly — using a manual to completely turn off the facility’s security system.

That was, without a doubt, close timing. There was only ten seconds remaining until the pair’s operational deadline. A group of over ten Dahan Magicians, all with gleaming metal bands on their heads, came to attack them. For a few minutes, there was a fierce fight and magical attack exchange — then the control room became unusable due to the extreme heat and the blast from the explosion.

Genzou became aware of his allies’ self-destruction from the fact that the security system was down, which he knew due to crossing two places where the barriers had been released. In order to leave no evidence nor genetic samples, their flesh had been engraved beforehand with conditionally activated magic that self-immolated their bodies. The activation of the cast magic was perceived by Genzou’s magic sense.

(…Sorry.)

Within his heart, Genzou apologized with one brief word. This battle, as he himself proclaimed, started with his own personal grudge. Nevertheless, his clan members accompanied him on his vengeance out of their own free will. Therefore apologizing for their sacrifice might be mocking their determination. —Even though he understood that, Genzou could not stop apologizing to his allies, who went to their deaths.

With this, the number of casualties to the Yotsuba clan from the feud they had started was twenty-nine. This was about half the number of Yotsuba who practice combat magic.

In contrast, the number of enemy magicians who had died added up to roughly three thousand five hundred. Each one that they had lost was balanced by about 120 times in enemies they had slaughtered, Yotsuba magicians did not go down easily. Genzou was determined that he would keep the balance sheets as they were.

Unlike his thoughts, his body did not stop. The director of the Kunlunfang Institute. He was today’s target. Genzou was running down the corridor with the silenced alarm system to the inner sanctum. And anyone standing in Genzou’s way, magician or not, would lose their life to the blade he flourished. Although he should not be aware of it, Genzou felt his magic calculation area overheat as he gradually approached his limits. If this continued, he was probably going to burn out his mind. Even so, there was no way he was going to stop now.

Facing the last door, Genzou did not stop his feet; without pausing, he accelerated.

The inside of the room was swollen with signs of magic.

There were probably four people whose magic rivaled his own. The director of the institute and his fellows. As Genzou faced his true desired foes, the magic of those who guarded them prepared to attack him.

Nevertheless, their magic was never completed.

Genzou’s magic was faster.

The abilities of the four magician’s and Genzou’s were nearly equal. Regardless of that fact, Genzou was one to two steps ahead since his magic was already active.

Genzou kept his knife level and waved it like a flag. As anticipated, the response mowed down that side in a flash. In front of the waving blade, four enemy magicians fell, their necks spouting blood.

Genzou’s magic was “Grim Reaper”. It was the type of mind manipulation magic that implanted a specific image in the victim’s mind. That image was “death”. To the victim who had been given a premonition of death, the display of a symbol of that image was strong suggestive magic. It did not matter if the first image was only an arbitrary one. Direct or indirect contact made no difference, time and distance were also not barriers. As long as the victim was able to recall that image, a suggestion could be amplified a thousand-fold to affect even the flesh.

Aside from ridding one’s own memory of the image, any kind of protection was meaningless. Adversaries who met Genzou killed themselves off in the second encounter. In order for this magic “Grim Reaper” to activate, a direct meeting with the victim was necessary. For the magic to be completed, Genzou had to be aware of his foe and his foe had to be aware of him. Being plunged into your own personal valley of death was the first effect of this magic.

While regretting that the presence of the four magicians meeting their doom could not be prolonged, Genzou leveled the knife to strike them down. The director of the Kunlunfang Institute, the Dahan government’s chief of military affairs, and the other Dahan dignitaries who quivered in this place simultaneously crumpled down, vomiting blood from the neck.

(This is way too quick)



Looking down on the horde of dead bodies before his eyes, Genzou soliloquized deep in his core. For this past half year, he had steadily cornered them to this end; Genzou was confident in the amount of terror he had generated in them. Nonetheless, the way the ultimate target had been brought down left him with the feeling that it might have better if it had been an even more painful way to die.

Unexpectedly.

As dizziness overcame him, Genzou went down on his knees.

He hurt like his head was split open,

(Wrong…)

In the midst of intense pain, Genzou deduced that the pain did not come from his body, but was rather sent to his body from his mind. The repeated use of “Grim Reaper” had exceeded the limits of his mind’s ability to use magic.

(I will never return to Japan.)

It was unsubstantiated. The limits of an individual’s magic calculation area could not yet be objectively measured by individuals. Nevertheless, Genzou was convinced of it. He who could manipulate the death visions of others felt death closer to him than ever before in his life.

Genzou sent strength into his trembling knees and stood up. In this facility, over one hundred people, the main body of all the employees and magicians who worked there remained.

(Looks like I shall be able to collect my fare to cross the Sanzu[27].)

Genzou bared his teeth in a grin and laughed.

(Miya, Maya, forgive me.)

As Genzou sought his next prey, he apologized in his heart to his beloved daughters whom he would never see again.

Thus, the Yotsuba’s revenge ended. In the aftermath, only tragedy lingered.

Yotsuba Maya lost her ability to procreate due to the injuries she received at this time. Regeneration treatment had progressed to the point of manufacturing limbs and transplanting them, but reviving her natural female abilities was beyond them.

Due to her inability to have a child, the Yotsuba clan and the Saegusa clan dissolved Maya and Koichi’s engagement. Saegusa Koichi had forever lost his right eye and his beloved simultaneously. As for Koichi, cloning and transplanting techniques had advanced enough to restore his eye. Nevertheless, Koichi rejected that possibility, for he could not live on alone unmarked as if nothing had happened.

In the aftermath of this incident, Miya broke her body from overusing her mind manipulation magic before she turned twenty like a penance. She was repeatedly in and out of the hospital and lived her life under medical care for ten years.

In response to Maya’s tragedy, the Yotsuba enacted a policy of attaching guards to clan members who possessed an especially superior disposition for magic. The post was not assumed by temporary guards who worked for money; these guards risked their lives to fulfill their duty throughout the lifetime of the one they protected — thus the Guardians were created.

In regards to the secret feud between the Yotsuba and Dahan; on the Yotsuba side, there were thirty dead. From this war, the Yotsuba lost the head of the family and half of its fighting strength.

On the other side, Dahan’s dead were approximately four thousand. For the sacrifice of a mere thirty people, the Yotsuba clan assassinated four thousand: cabinet ministers, high class bureaucrats, officers, magicians and researchers; as for the continent of Asia, it had all its research results on modern magic annihilated.

Due to this damage, Dahan suffered an internal collapse after one year and the Great Asian Alliance unified the continent of Asia.

As for East Asia, the antagonism between the North and the South came to a resolution; as for the northern hemisphere, a resolution for the world wide border conflicts was jury-rigged.

It was the end of World War III.

And among those who knew the truth about the collapse of Dahan, the Yotsuba were feared as “Untouchable”.





Afterword




Once again, truly, thank you very much to those who read “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei”. To everyone who picked it up for the first time, from now on, I hope you’ll stay with me.

The 8th volume this time is an “episode zero” story about the past and a short story about an organisation even further back. The short story “Untouchable” was written originally to be the preamble and so, the short story was made to be shorter. The short story was sent to the end of the volume on the advice of editor M Ki-san but, this order truly does make the unusual circumstances of Miya and the Yotsuba stand out more I think.

Speaking of short, when I submitted my paper manuscript by visiting M Ki-san and he said “the paperbacks are supposed to be of about this length” and I ended up shocked. Probably ignorance by the short length of the[ir] career. I must reflect on my thoughts. …While I may have said I reflected on my thoughts, I won’t be restricted from making the best of it.

I don’t particularly think the reason of “the longer the novel, the more it’s worth reading due to the value” is valued but, so too are there times where I complete a novel and it ends up longer. Like with the Dengeki Bunko Magazine serialisation, at first, I insert my conscious and I can finish it like that but, but if I don’t do it within the limitations, I tend to unconsciously pack everything in it seems.

A good (or bad, whichever works best) example of this would be the audio drama that goes on sale this month. When I was given a chance to request the manuscript for the drama CD, I proposed thinking “I want to do the past scenes of the reminiscence chapter as a full scenario” and it was approved, it received the “OK” for the drama version of the whole thing and I thought, they must have made a mistake. I thought it wouldn’t end up as just one volume, perhaps it would be finalised as three or four sets – and that’s simply thoughtlessness as it disregards cost.

Luckily, it ended up being an interactive DVD but they kept me in suspense until it was set in stone so once again, I offer my apologies.

Nevertheless, I received assistance from all involved resulting, in effect, an audio drama that the fans can look forward to I believe.

It’s become somewhat like advertisement for the audio drama DVD but rest assured, I believe this novel will also surely be received satisfactorily. –To everyone who picked up this book, I hope that you will all feel that it is “interesting” from the depths of your heart.

Well then, please look forward to the next novel, Volume 9 – Visitor Chapter (I). Thank you very much.

Notes




Туман-бомба: Mist Bomb.

Ani: This means elder brother. Normally, a younger sibling would use an honorific with it. I am using the word because using my elder brother would indicate intimacy between Miyuki and Tatsuya that she doesn’t feel.

Chichi: Father without any honorifics. I am using the Japanese word because normally someone like Miyuki would use Otou-sama.

Yuki-Onna (雪女, “Snow Woman”): Is a female spirit or snow monster (yōkai) Japanese folklore. Yuki-onna appears on snowy nights as a tall, beautiful woman with long black hair and blue lips. Her inhumanly pale or even transparent skin makes her blend into the snowy landscape. She sometimes wears a white kimono, but other legends describe her as nude, with only her face and hair standing out against the snow. Despite her inhuman beauty, her eyes can strike terror into mortals. She floats across the snow, leaving no footprints (in fact, some tales say she has no feet, a feature of many Japanese ghosts), and she can transform into a cloud of mist or snow if threatened.



A Big Black Male Teenager: Descriptions given later indicate that this guy and his friends are in their late teens or early twenties.

Dogeza: A deep bow with the forehead on the ground given to beg forgiveness.

Taiko (太鼓): Are a broad range of Japanese percussion instruments. In Japanese, the term refers to any kind of drum, but outside Japan, it is used to refer to any of the various Japanese drums called wadaiko (和太鼓 “Japanese drums”) and to the form of ensemble taiko drumming more specifically called kumi-daiko (組太鼓 “set of drums”). The process of constructing taiko varies between manufacturers, and preparation of both the drum body and skin can take several years depending on methodology.

Oji-sama: A polite way of saying uncle.

Chichi: Father without any honorifics.

Ryuukyuu Dance: Ryukyu dance developed as a court dance in the 15th century in the Ryukyu Kingdom (present-day Okinawa). It was originally performed to welcome envoys from China. The restrained nature of the dance is unique — emotions coming from the music build up inside the dancers, but they let only subtle movements express their feelings.

Source: NIPPONIA Archives.

Inner Striking: No real English equivalent; the idea of hitting your opponent in the stomach and having the impact transfer all the way to the back.

Air Force Base: Lieutenant is not an air force rank.

Deathly: “Four” and “death” have the same pronunciation in Japanese.

Tooate: “Striking at a distance” by projecting your ki, without physical contact. Kinda like a Hadouken.

Two-factor Theory of Emotion: Misattribution of arousal is a term in psychology which describes the process whereby people make a mistake in assuming what is causing them to feel aroused. For example, when actually experiencing physiological responses related to fear, people mislabel those responses as romantic arousal. The reason physiological symptoms may be attributed to incorrect stimuli is because many stimuli have similar physiological symptoms such as increased blood pressure or shortness of breath.

Ue (上): Archaic formal term of address for Aunt, made by combining the japanese word for aunt (Oba) with the honorific Ue. Still used nowadays in the upper echelons of Japanese society, albeit extremely rarely. It carries immense respect, which can be further increased by the addition of “-sama”.



It literally means “above”, and denotes a high level of respect. While its use is no longer common, it is still seen in constructions like chichi-ue (父上), haha-ue (母上) and ane-ue (姉上), reverent terms for “father”, “mother” and “sister” respectively. Receipts that do not require specification of the payer’s name are often filled in with ue-sama.

Dono/Tono: An honorific that lies between “-san” and “-sama”. When attached to a name it roughly equates to “lord” or “master”.



Tono (殿【との】), pronounced dono (どの) when attached to a name, roughly means “lord” or “master”. It does not equate noble status; rather it is a term akin to “milord” or French “monseigneur, and lies below sama in level of respect. This title is not commonly used in daily conversation, but it is still used in some types of written business correspondence, as well as on certificates and awards, and in written correspondence in tea ceremonies. It is/was also used to indicate that the person referred to has the same (high) rank as the referrer, yet commands respect from the speaker.

The main island of Tsushima was once a single island but was divided into two in 1671 by the Ōfunakoshiseto canal and into three in 1900 by the Manzekiseto canal. These canals were driven through isthmuses in the center of the island, creating North Tsushima Island (Kamijima) and South Tsushima Island (Shimojima). Tsushima also incorporates over 100 smaller islands (many tiny). The name Tsushima generally refers to all the islands collectively.
