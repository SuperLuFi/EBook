The Heating Magic was nullified by the Gram Demolition coming off the elbow, but for Tomitsuka, this was the expected outcome.

From his current position with the right leg extended, Tomitsuka used a right hook. No, that wasn’t a right hook. He wasn’t leading with the fist but the fingers instead, making this a palm strike. Still, his current bent posture was usually unable to deliver a strike with any force behind it.

Despite this, Tomitsuka’s palm strike was both swift and vicious. Bending at the waist to block the kick, Tatsuya was in a position where he was unable to avoid this attack.

Pah, a lifeless sound rang out.

“Onii-sama!”

Along with a mournful shriek.

Tatsuya’s body rolled along the floorboards.

Lowering his right leg and retracting the right hand while standing there only on his left leg, Tomitsuka blinked in shock as he stood there like a doll.

“……Tomitsuka is surprisingly devious. That rascal was aiming for the older Shiba’s eardrum.”

Kirihara saw that Tomitsuka’s palm strike actually curved the palm to concentrate the air pressure on the point of contact.

“Ho, and he managed to jump away himself! Can’t believe he managed to neutralize Tomitsuka’s ‘Self Marionette’ even under those conditions. Shiba-kun, nicely done!”

By the time the two Year 3 students finished dissecting the exchange, Tatsuya had already recovered his footing. Sawaki correctly caught Tatsuya rolling away to widen the distance.

Tomitsuka’s astounded expression came from the lack of any physical resistance that he believed was inevitable. If Tatsuya had stiffened his neck to prevent the head from shaking, then any stiffening in his leg and waist should have resulted in physical pushback on his hand. If he relaxed to jump back in accordance with the force of the blow, then naturally the contact would feel soft. In other words, Tatsuya relaxed at the same time that he applied force.

Tomitsuka hurtled any shock fountaining from his heart into the back of his mind as he activated Self Marionette again. This was a type of magic that only used Move-Type Magic to move his physical body. This Magic Sequence attempted to suppress the flesh’s magical resistance as much as possible while prudently taking heed not to surpass the extents of the joints’ movement.

This was not a magic that could be used haphazardly. In terms of design, modern magic could only mimic movements. Nevertheless, this could still create attacks like the previous one that should have been impossible according to human anatomy and physics.

Tomitsuka turned himself into a puppet master that wielded his own body like a doll and attacked Tatsuya in a manner that ran counter to martial theory. –And Tatsuya saw through the movements of the psions surrounding Tomitsuka’s body.

Tomitsuka’s entire body had been covered by a single Magic Sequence. It was an exceedingly complex Magic Sequence that even a high-class Magician would be hard pressed to recreate. Maybe it was because he didn’t want them to interfere with the Magic Sequence, but the disorderly psions that surrounded his body were now neat and orderly, recreating an untouchable Eidos that only suffered Self Marionette to pass.

The disorderly chaos had transformed into an orderly world.

Order was both form and design.

Tatsuya’s “Decomposition” could destroy designs. Although he was unable to destroy formless objects, he could deconstruct anything with a form even if it was the Eidos.

The formless cloud of psions wrapped around Tomitsuka now had a form created by Tomitsuka’s own magic.

Through “Elemental Sight”, Tatsuya understood this immediately. He also saw that this was an incredibly opportune moment for victory.

Tatsuya directed psions into his CAD. He was not pretending to use his CAD but actually using the CAD for Decomposition Magic. The magic he chose was “Gram Dispersal”.

Tatsuya pulled the trigger.

With the form in hand, Tatsuya’s magic that destroyed information shredded Tomitsuka’s armor.

The exposed fighting marionette closed in on Tatsuya.

Tatsuya held a concentrated block of psions in his left hand.

The solid block was so sturdy that it could have broken through Tomitsuka’s armor even if it had recovered.

This was not hiding his strength, but to achieve victory. Rather than choosing the magic he was most comfortable with but which still might be blocked by the incomplete armor, Tatsuya chose the magic bullet that would definitely pierce through the incomplete armor.

Designed and honed to clash against inhuman objects, the high pressure, high penetration Far Strike named “Penetrating Magic Shell” (by Yakumo) shot from Tatsuya’s hand and pierced through the fighting marionette named Tomitsuka.



Taking a shot from the cannonball that had no physical form, Tomitsuka flew backwards. This was Self Marionette’s side effect. Once he suffered a powerful blow directly, this impression would rewrite the variables for the Magic Sequence. Using a Magic Sequence that did not have a complete command interface caused the theoretical miscalculation that ultimately ended with Tomitsuka’s defeat.

Sent flying by his own magic, Tomitsuka laid there with his limbs extended outwards and did not move a muscle. Since he was unable to restore strength into his relaxed muscles in time, he had suffered a mild concussion.

“Victor, Shiba.”

After verifying Tomitsuka’s condition, Hattori announced Tatsuya’s victory.

“O……”

After murmuring “Onii-sama”, Miyuki lowered her head. Forgetting herself, she was about to pounce on Tatsuya when she recovered her wits at the last second.

Tatsuya smiled gently at Miyuki when she raised her head.

Nodding at the brilliant smile coming from his sister, Tatsuya turned his body around.

He put the CAD in his right hand back into the holster and walked towards where Tomitsuka was lying on the ground.

“Tomitsuka, can you stand?”

Still lying on the ground, Tomitsuka used his right hand to tightly grasp Tatsuya’s extended right hand.

“Thanks.”

Getting a lift from Tatsuya, Tomitsuka finally got back to his feet. He appeared to be a little shaky, but his concussion didn’t appear to be too serious. Tomitsuka’s footsteps quickly returned to normal.

“As I thought. You’re really strong, Shiba-kun.”

“You as well, Tomitsuka. That hurt a lot.”

Faced with Tomitsuka honestly pulling off his helmet, Tatsuya smiled back with his reddened face.

Next to them, a silhouette dashed by.

“Ah, hey, Shippou!”

Without turning his head, Takuma fled Practice Room #3.




At the end of the Robotics Club’s garage, an empty area next to the outdoors practice facility had become a sparsely populated location for private conversations.

Yet, Takuma had not come here for this reason. He happened to chance upon here after running away from the eyes and ears of other individuals.

Before the sizable tree that incidentally didn’t have a “cursed” legend attached to it, Takuma stood there numbly for a long moment. However, maybe because he was unable to control the agitation welling up inside him, he suddenly began punching the tree with his right hand.

“Damn it, damn it, DAMN IT!”

He lost count of how many times he punched the tree.

“Stop it, Shippou. You’re starting to bleed.”

When his curses grew ragged, a voice called out to him from behind.

Takuma swiftly turned his head.

There, he found Kasumi staring at him in astonishment.

“Saegusa, you!”

Seeing Takuma glaring at her furiously, Kasumi raised both hands and shook them softly.

“Ah, don’t misunderstand. I wasn’t following you. I just happened to be here by coincidence.”

After saying this, Kasumi walked towards the frowning Shippou. She pulled out a handkerchief and folded it into a bandage before grabbing Takuma’s hand while he was glaring at her the entire time.

“What are you doing!?”

“Ah…… The skin peeled off.”

Kasumi wrinkled her eyebrows at the blood and wrapped the handkerchief around the hand of the faltering Shippou.

“Sorry, I haven’t been given permission to use Healing Magic. Remember, you’re better off going to the infirmary later.”

Takuma was unable to answer Kasumi’s words. He could only stare at the handkerchief stained with his blood.

“Oh, and you don’t need to return the handkerchief.”

“…………”

Standing in front of the completely motionless Takuma, Kasumi sighed deeply.

“You must have been soundly beaten.”

“…………”

“As expected, the upperclassmen’s bar is really high.”

“……Why?”

Takuma’s eyes remained on the ground.

“Hm, why what?”

Finally seeing a reaction, Kasumi played along with another sentence.

“Why are those guys so strong!?”

A painful outcry. This cry must be what they mean by spitting blood, Kasumi thought. —As for who “those guys” were, Kasumi instinctively knew already.

“They’re high school students like us, aren’t they!? There’s only one year’s worth of difference! Even so, how are those guys so incredibly strong!?”

“Why does there have to be a special reason?”

“What did you say……?”

Kasumi finally felt like they were having a conversation, but she was foolish enough to say that aloud.

“They must be strong because they are. True enough…… If you have to find a reason, then they must have worked hard to get to where they are, no?”





“I also……!”

“Yeah, you must have worked hard too. I did as well. Yet, surely those guys are stronger because they put more effort into it, right?”

“…………”

“I’m not denying your talent here, OK? I too believe that a large proportion of my own power comes from my talent.”

“…………”

“But, a level of ‘might’ that is enough to stagger even me…… Surely that came from a different place than talent, don’t you agree?”

Takuma raised his head and looked Kasumi in the eye.

From Takuma’s eyes, a tear of regret trickled down.

“Well, I’m not exactly interested in something like ‘might’. Since you want to get stronger, then that is your problem. Remember, Shippou’s strength is something that belongs to Shippou.”

Just as she said, Kasumi easily turned around and vanished from Takuma’s sight.

Once again, Takuma vented his rage on the tree, this time using his palm instead of his fist.




After splitting off from the Club Activities Group members with Hattori at their head, Tatsuya returned to the Student Council Room and sat at his own desk before opening the communicator. Typing away at the keyboard at a speed that could not be captured by the naked eye, the recipient of the message he typed was also someone currently in the Student Council Room.

[Yes, Master?]

Setting the target as Tatsuya, Pixie began communicating via telepathy.

[Have you finished changing the records?]

Avoiding the written documentation of the other Student Council members,

[It has been done as you ordered. A false recording has been uploaded instead.]

He received the answer he desired.

[Master, have I been of assistance to you?]

[Indeed you have. Thanks for your hard work.]

He bestowed words of thanks to the monster that was keeping the secret.

[You can rest for today.]

[Yes, Master. Entering Standby Mode.]

After giving orders for the doll to rest, Tatsuya erased the conversation record.





Epilogue




“That flying ship was actually stolen property. According to the television agency, the code used in the flight plan request was stolen as well.”

Currently, Tatsuya was conversing with Fujibayashi over the phone installed in his own room.

The subject was the flying ship they encountered during that night. This was an investigative report on whether the ones responsible for the suicide attack on Tatsuya that led to his painful experience were terrorists or part of a criminal organization.

“Unfortunately, the only known quantity is that they are affiliated with a Chinese criminal organization.”

Yet, just as Fujibayashi said, the results of the investigation were not promising.

“A Chinese criminal organization. Does that imply you already know their identities?”

“Hm, but not all of them. He was an opponent that had a history with you, Tatsuya-kun.”

“……You don’t mean No Head Dragon, do you?”

“—The remnants, yes. Robert Sun was a cousin of the nephew of Richard Sun, the leader of No Head Dragon. He has been confirmed to have led a helicopter jacking in the past.”

“A nephew’s cousin……?”

Tatsuya swallowed the words “wasn’t that practically a stranger” that were on the tip of his tongue. That was because he recalled an example of someone who constituted a blood relation even on this level who happened to be right next to him.

“Well, that’s practically an outsider. That’s probably why only a few underlings followed him here after No Head Dragon’s collapse.”

Nevertheless, it seemed that anyone thinking along the same lines drew similar conclusions. However, this was not the time and place to consider such trivialities.

“Of course, last night’s incident would be beyond the means of such a miniscule force. Whether they were conspirators or the ones plotting behind the scenes, some degree of support must have been involved……”

“And remains unknown, correct?”

“Indeed.”

The situation appeared to be far graver than Tatsuya had imagined. Originally, an attempted terrorist attack in the heart of Tokyo was already a serious enough matter, and now they were supported in the shadows by someone even Fujibayashi could not catch hold of. Of course, they had to take into account that they had no evidence at the moment. Even so, this was not an opponent they could afford to underestimate.

Still, the thought that flashed across Tatsuya’s mind was not “hopefully this won’t become an issue”, but a more selfish wish like “hopefully this troublesome issue won’t affect Miyuki and me”.




Here was a bustling street at night. Slightly a ways off from the street, a certain small store stood in an alley.

Nakura used the weak light of a flashlight to verify the name of the store.

This was indeed the meeting place that was arranged with the current head of house, Saegusa Koichi.

If he had not known about this store, Nakura was certain he would have walked right past here. Opening the doors made of manufactured alloy that only held the distinction of sturdiness, Nakura took the stairs to the second floor. After being led into the room by an emotionless male employee, his opposing number for the appointment had been waiting for his arrival for some time.

“Have I caused you to wait very long?”

“Hardly at all. I just got here myself.”

The one spoke as he rose from the chair was a fair young man who gave off a charismatic and vibrant air that Nakura could never hope to match.

“My name is Nakura.”

“I am Zhou. Please, take a seat.”

Unlike the male employee who led the way here, there was a cute and attentive young woman standing in the room. Following Zhou’s verbal cue, the beautiful woman in the waitress uniform pulled back Nakura’s seat across from Zhou’s chair with a practiced motion. Seeing Nakura take a seat without a second thought, Zhou returned to his own seat.

“Would you like something to drink?”

“A good point. How about some white wine?”

Zhou’s eyebrow arched in surprise. To Zhou’s knowledge, very few guests actually took him up on that customary offer for a drink by ordering alcohol.

“……Would a normal bottle of maotai wine suffice?”

“As you wish.”

The wine Zhou ordered was swiftly obtained. After the small glass cups were filled with wine, Nakura and Zhou watched each other’s breathing and downed their drinks at the same time.

Setting the empty glass in the center of the table, Nakura carefully scrutinized Zhou’s gaze.

“Nakura-sama.”

The one who spoke first was Zhou.

“My master wishes to form a friendly relationship with Nakura-sama’s master.”

“My master said that there would be no problems agreeing with Zhou-san’s proposal.”

Hearing Nakura’s response, Zhou revealed a devilish smile.

“Oh dear, your confidence fills me with dread. Then, shall we proceed to a few more concrete details?”

“Our side has already proposed our basic conditions.”

“Of course, I am well aware of that. We would never do anything that would harm Saegusa-sama. After all, we do not share the Great Asian Alliance’s interests.”

“And what of the media operation?”

“That too we understand. We have already given the order to curb the propaganda work directed universally at Magicians.”

“I see. Then let us discuss the finer details.”

Zhou once more used his eyes to give an order to the female employee.

The beautiful woman serving as their waitress bowed deeply before leaving the room. Besides Nakura and Zhou, no one was privy to the discussion that ensued in the room.





Afterword




Firstly, to those who picked up this book, I offer my gratitude from the depths of my heart. To the first-timers, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, and if this is not your first time, I thank you for following this series.

Was this episode with second year Tatsuya, Miyuki and their group of friends and the new students who became their kouhai[5] to your liking? Since this series is a story about the siblings, the protagonists, it will naturally cover from their entrance into high school under their graduation so their movement up the grades cannot be avoided and consequently, their relationships will see an inevitable renewal or update. As those who have read this volume understand, graduation does not necessarily mean that they will no longer appear in the story, but the new characters also must be given a part in the story. If they were not given a role in the story, what reason would there be for them to be introduced in the story right.

Accordingly, what must be thought about becomes the new character’s traits. This time, I had little to no trouble in the creation of the new students who appeared in this volume. It is because I already finished a rough “mould” of the characters since when I started writing this story. Of course, I did make a few important adjustments. I suppose the one who changed the most was Kent – he originally wore the girl’s uniform. Nevertheless, because it wasn’t really “that” as I was constructing the scenario, it was rejected so…

What really gives me a headache is next year’s group of new students. Speaking honestly, at this point, the character outlines are still completely blank… … Well, as I write it, the ogres and demons of the world will probably laugh and say “what next year’s episode?” but should this series safely reach that point you are free to laugh at the traces of the author’s distress. This is a different story but, as you may already know, this Double Seven Chapter was serialised in the Dengeki Bunko Magazine. While my intention was that I wanted to bring the episode to all the fans while it was still semi-freshly written (as I was writing it)… … Reflecting on it, I feel it may have been a little thoughtless an experiment.

I was aware that it was awkward because I was constructing the story with a factor that should’ve existed at that point in time as something that didn’t, but to think I didn’t realise just how poorly I had done it. When I was revising the script, it hurt me to realise that there was almost no explanation as to what was going on in the background. This paper edition may have reached the bare minimum of what’s required to supplement it I believe but, what do you think of it?

Around the time this book is lined up on the shelves in stores, great news have probably reached the ears of everyone I think. Actually, while this Double Seven Chapter was in serialisation, I caused a great deal of burden on all of the staff bug from now on, the hardship should be decreasing I think. Thank you very much for all your help.

However, that’s something from behind the scenes. In order for all the fans to enjoy “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” even more than now, us, staff and I, will with all our might, push onwards so please look forward to the series even from here on.

Notes




Bokutachi: Yami was using “bokutachi”, which is a form of “we” (or “our” here) usually used by boys.

Sumisu (スミス): Translates to Smith. Might not be related but there is also a “Sumisu” song by Farin Urlaub that is homage to The Smiths.



“Sumisu” is a song by Farin Urlaub. It’s the second single and third track from his debut album Endlich Urlaub!. The song is a homage to the Smiths – according to the lyrics, Farin used to listen to them, when he was down. “Sumisu” (“スミス”) is “Smith” in Japanese.

Yamato Nadeshiko: Is a Japanese term meaning the “personification of an idealized Japanese woman”, or “the epitome of pure, feminine beauty”. It is a floral metaphor, combining the words Yamato, an ancient name for Japan, and nadeshiko, a delicate frilled pink carnation called Dianthus superbus (see image), whose kanji translate into English as “caressable child” (or “wide-eyed barley”).

The term “Yamato nadeshiko” is often used referring to a girl or shy young woman and, in a contemporary context, nostalgically of women with “good” traits which are perceived as being increasingly rare.

Translator’s Note: For the curious, 三枝 became 七草.

Kouhai: The opposite of “senpai” – upperclassmen, “kouhai” means “underclassmen”.
