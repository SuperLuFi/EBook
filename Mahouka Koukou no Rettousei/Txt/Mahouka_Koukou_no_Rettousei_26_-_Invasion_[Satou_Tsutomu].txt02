(There is one other parasite. But he is completely sealed away, still, from time to time, I can still hear him screaming while he is being used as a lab rat. I want to go and rescue him, but that would be impossible for me.)



The parasite he is talking about has been sealed away by the Yotsuba Family. Their Mental Interference Magic that has sealed it is dangerous for parasites. Plus, he couldn’t figure out where the parasite was being held.



It was like this screaming was warning sign.



To make sure no else tries to come rescue him.



(No, I/we don’t think that’s stupid, we understand.)



Since he wasn’t hiding his thoughts, this reaction was genuine. This was probably Raymond’s voice of reason coming through.



(You understand?)



Again, he asked the question. But really, Raymond wanted to make Minoru talk more, so naturally he asked more questions.



(We are separate beings, we all have our individual thoughts, but our goals should be the same.)



Minoru understood but disagreed.



Minoru knew what kind of person Raymond was.



But Minoru still refused.



He didn’t want to become a parasite, but he needs one for his goals. So the only reason he uses one is to treat Minami.

He didn’t want to be rude to Raymond by continuously disagreeing. But Raymond keeps saying ‘we’ and Minoru just doesn’t want himself to be included in that.



(We're going to kill Tatsuya, I/we all have this common intention!)



Finally, their true intent came out.



These weren’t the thoughts of just Raymond and Regulus. They didn’t seem to notice themselves, but their consciousness was still connected to the ones still in the USNA, even though they didn’t think this was possible.



This was a statement. In one moment, the various different thoughts all became one and were directed at the ears of Minoru.



Among them, the intention to eliminate Tatsuya was the most dominant.



It wasn’t just Raymond, but also the members of STARS who recognizes the threat of Tatsuya’s Strategic Class Magic.



However, Minoru confronted this massive wave of thoughts that had come towards him and instead of submitting, he reminded himself of his own, strong ‘desire’.



He has no intention to leave Minami the way she is right now. He just wants to save her from her fate. This was the reason that he abandoned his humanity.



Because of someone other than himself, he had changed.



Personality is formed by nature. Desire and impulse are the base of your spirit. How to control it, what to do, what not to do, what to forgive, are all connected to society and the people you are with. And if you listen to the desires of the people around you, you change.



In doing so, you throw away the thing limiting you, and become someone that can help others── With greed at its core, Minoru was able to maintain his ‘self’ even though it wasn’t ‘for himself’ but for ‘someone else’s sake’.



It was a long battle.



It was also an instant battle.



In the world of the mind, there is no duration of time. The time had several points in it, so it wasn’t a chronological line. Therefore, the battle was both ‘long’ and ‘instant’.



At the end of the eternal battle that happened in a single moment, Minoru was the one left standing.



(Raymond, you’ll help me, won’t you? First, we’ll get Minami. Tatsuya comes after that.)



(I/We will obey Minoru’s will.)



Minoru continued to be himself until the end.



But, you couldn’t say that he was completely the same.



Human beings will be affected if they continue to hear the same thing a dozen times or even a hundred times. Even if you deny it, your empathy will gradually decrease.



This was not related to human weakness. He had continued to be himself, even if he isn’t human, by reminding himself of his goal that he originally.



But even so, he had been exposed to hundreds of whispers to get rid of Tatsuya.



(We will deal with Tatsuya-san afterwards.)



Before he knew it, Minoru’s consciousness had also changed and had deteriorated.



[Six]



There was some trouble with the entry of illegal immigrants through the Kansai International Airport and yet, Japan was mostly peaceful.



Though a fierce battle took place between Minoru and Raymond in the spiritual dimension, the general public was none the wiser.



The recent aggressive protests from anti-magic organizations are in a lull.



The handing over of Major Sirius to the USNA wasn't strictly required, whereas the Great Asian Union couldn't afford to meddle with the Nansei Islands section. On the surface, matters pertaining to diplomacy were quiet despite the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense both feeling uneasy.



Regarding the Great Asian Union, something that would shake the world was announced on Friday, June 28 th .



Miyuki and Tatsuya heard the news that shocked the world.



"Breaking news!"



While having breakfast in the morning right before school, they turned back to the tense voice that had come from the newscaster.



They put down their chopsticks and faced the TV.



"For an, as of right now, unknown reason, the Great Asian Union and the New Soviet Union are at war."



Miyuki was completely shocked. If she still had her chopsticks in her hands, she would have surely dropped them on the ground.



On the other hand, Tatsuya who had also put his chopsticks down was listening to the news seriously.



“Late last night, the Great Asian Union invaded along the Lake Khanka border, where they started advancing south towards Ussuriysk. The New Soviet Union mobilized the military in the Far East that was stationed in Vladivostok. They collided 30 kilometers from Ussuriysk and the battle still continues."



Miyuki looked at Tatsuya with awkward movement.



"Onii-sama, this seems like a very serious matter..."



He looked away from the TV and into the eyes of Miyuki.



"This is a military clash that has occurred in an area close to Japan, so the impact on

our country will be inevitable."



Tatsuya’s voice had a tension that was different from usual.



The newscaster reappeared in front of the camera.



“The aim of the Great Asian Union is to capture the southernmost part of the Primorsky Krai Region. The region, especially Vladivostok, is geopolitical meaningful to them as it allows them to remove the threat of a knife at their throat and paves the safe removal of the threat to the Goryeo Autonomous Region."



A map was being displayed on the TV. When they saw this, the words of the caster became that much more convincing.



“Why is Vladivostok being aimed for via this current route, so invading down south, when the forces in the Goryeo Autonomous Region are closer and could have been mobilized?"



“The Great Asian Union have suffered a massive loss to their naval forces because of the Yokohama Incident, they haven't recovered enough to attack Vladivostok from the south; though if forced to they would use the navy from there which is indispensable."



"That’s correct."



To the explanation of the caster, Tatsuya agreed.



“Have the Great Asian Union been preparing for an invasion ever since this moment?”



“I think the Great Asian Union had started preparations for a full-scale attack more than a year ago. Basically, after the Nichia Peace Treaty was signed, which was beneficial to Japan. In addition, a rumor that had been going around the last few days via military officials mentioned that the central government of the Great Asian Union needed a military achievement to restore its prestige."



"...?"



The news correspondent seen on the news feed was now discussing the military capabilities of both countries.



“The New Soviet Union has Dr. Bezobrazov, a nationally recognized Strategic Class Magic, who has been rumoured to be deceased or has at least been inactive in his work.”



"I hadn’t thought about that."



At the time, Tatsuya had a sneaky smile, but this disappeared when he saw Miyuki, who was still completely serious about the situation.



“If we take the military capabilities of both countries into consideration, the New Soviet Union wins in terms of quality and the Great Asian Union wins in terms of quantity. In addition, the military forces of the New Soviet Union are widely spread out in East Asia, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. The Siberian military is located further north than the rest of the troops. The Great Asian Union calculated that so long as the opposing Strategic-Class Magician isn't able to fight, then they have enough forces to attain victory.”



“To which extent do you have information that indicates that Dr. Bezobrazov won’t be part of this war?"



“It’s impossible to say with complete certainty. It has only been a week since magic, that looked like the New Soviet Union’s Strategic Class Magic, had been seen at Tokyo’s First High, and we haven’t heard a thing about it since.”



“A story has also been going around that the strong magic that had been used on the Izu Peninsula in the beginning of this month was also associated with the New Soviet Union.”



"That's true. These unexpected attacks could have been committed by Igor. I think there is a reasonable likelihood that Dr. Bezobrazov was involved in the situation."



“The fact is that Dr. Bezobrazov, who was trying to call for world peace using the Dione Project, was a participant in an unexpected attack on the Izu Peninsula …”



“Do you expect this to have any influence on the future?"



The assistant, who hadn’t said anything before, was panicking a little. Maybe the director had instructed him to ‘not discuss the Dione Project’.



"That's right."



The newscaster, like the assistant, was trying to change the topic.



“The Great Asian Union’s army will engage in battle before the Siberian troops will arrive. In other words, the outcome of the battle will depend on its length.”



“Then, does the New Soviet Union want to turn this into an endurance race until

their reinforcements get there?"



The newscaster finally got back to the previous topic, so the Dione Project topic was forgotten about.



"I think so".



"Will the Great Asian Union use Strategic Class Magic?"



“I think it might be the time to truly introduce Liu Li Lei, to not just the battle, but to the whole world.”



Even though discussion about the current story continues, Tatsuya and Miyuki left as he escorts her to school from the house.



Although Miyuki was also worried that they were going to be a bit late. She was also wondering how Tatsuya was going to be spending his time during school, when he’s free.



"Onii-sama, what are you going to be doing today?"



So Miyuki decided to ask Tatsuya.



"I haven’t received a call from Lieutenant Colonel Kazama, so I’ll go to FLT."



"You aren’t going to see Lina?"



“I could.”



This was undoubtedly because of the conflict that has just occurred between the Great Asian Union and the New Soviet Union. So Miyuki was anxious.



◇ ◇ ◇



And Tatsuya’s expectations were right.



"It is regrettable how the situation from before that damaged the trust we have in one another still continues. However, as you know, an emergency has occurred. Will you be coming to the base any time soon?”



"I will."



To Kazama, the request seems to have gone well, with Tatsuya nodding in reply after he had just returned to his apartment.



Even if Tatsuya were to fight against the National Defense Forces, nothing would come of it and that in such a case, there isn’t a reason to fuss over such a matter.



"I regret my previous actions."



He didn’t know what Tatsuya’s true feelings were on the matter, but nevertheless, he lowered his head while saying these words.



◇ ◇ ◇



At the same time Tatsuya was watching the news about the military conflict going on in the Far East, Minoru, who had won the fierce battle the night before, didn't imitate as if he had gone to sleep. Both Raymond and Regulus hadn't awoken yet, due in part because of the nature of the Parasites and not because of jet lag.



"They should probably listen to this...."



This may lead to opportunities, is what Minoru was thinking.



(If the military conflict is prolonged, the Ten Master Clans would have to move their attention to the Sea of Japan, where if something were to happen in the southern portion of the sea, they'd end up having to deal with it instead of focusing on me...)



If the TV commentator is right, the war was triggered by Tatsuya's counterattack on Igor, which gravely harmed him.



(It’s ironic that Tatsuya’s ruthless response to Igor’s actions has given us this opportunity.)



Minami, who was injured by an attack of Igor and the influence of Igor's defeat which still floats about, could cause Tatsuya to lose his chance to defend Minami.



Minoru agreed with Raymond’s reasoning.



◇ ◇ ◇



Tatsuya cancelled his scheduled visit to Miyaki Island and FLT and headed towards Kasumigaura Base, the Headquarters of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.



Of course, Tatsuya reported this to Maya, whom he talked to directly, in which she thought it be a good thing that relations with the National Defense Forces be restored. This was partially because it would be difficult to let go of the ability where the National Defense Force could mobilize soldiers in great number.



"Lieutenant, I have arrived."



After he had arrived, Tatsuya greeted Kazama.



With Fujibayashi present as his adjutant, Kazama also saluted to Tatsuya.



"The main reason for my coming here today is because I want to hear about Bezobrazov.”



When the villa in Izu was attacked, Tatsuya found out that Kazama knew that the individual responsible that was taken care of wasn't Igor. However, what happened as a result of the attack on First High wasn't reported to the military. It was reported to the Main House.



Tatsuya never spoke again about the information, whether or not it was passed on from the Yotsuba Family to the National Defense Forces, which it eventually wasn’t.



“I didn’t attack Igor directly, instead I decomposed a large CAD that was in operation, so it is possible that he received some damage.”



"Are you talking about the train-type CAD that you mentioned the other day?"



"That's right."



“If you destroy these CADs while someone is connected to them, could it make them suffer from mental damage through their Magic Calculation Area? And if so, was Bezobrazov connected to his CAD and thus received damage?"



"That is likely, since we have not seen any signs of ‘Tuman Bomba’ being used since then.”



"Hmm..."



Kazama decided that it would be a good idea to remember this.



"...So what do you think, how great is the probability that Igor has died?"



"I’d say it isn’t even a single percent."



"So, basically, it’s zero?"



"Rephrasing it like that is okay."



After saying this, Tatsuya added that ‘The likelihood of any accidental deaths having occurred was non-existent.’



“So do you think that after some time, Bezobrazov will be able to reappear during the invasion by the Great Asian Union?”



“If the military leadership of the New Soviet Union thought that they themselves, without Bezobrazov, were able to see sufficient battle results as of right now, they would have done so already, but they know that they can’t without him.”



"How long do you think it will take for him to recover?"



"Going off our previous encounters when I forcibly disconnected him from his CAD, I’d say it would take ten to twenty days for him to recover."



Today is Friday.



The attack from Tuman Bomba on First High took place the Thursday before.



“So another attack can be expected in a few days, or another week.”



"I would think so."



"...I understood."



Tatsuya didn’t come here today just for this, he also wanted to discuss something else.



"Lieutenant, I also have something that I want to talk about."



"Go ahead."



"As you may already know, parasites have come to this country again."



“I know, we’re talking about the one from the Kudou family, right?”



"New parasites have appeared in the USNA."



"What...?"



Doesn’t it seem like the National Defense Forces have no knowledge of what has transpired in the USNA?



In any case, he didn’t want to waste any time.



"There was a rebellion within STARS at their base headquarters the week before and it’s a fact that members of STARS have been possessed by parasites."



"...Is this information you have heard from Major Sirius?"



"No. We were given this information by Angelina Kudou Shields’ relative, Kudou Retsu."



Tatsuya again insisted that he didn’t have ‘Major Sirius’.



"...Really...”



They still hadn’t restored their relationship enough for this to be told.



"And, apparently, it seems that at least two parasites have infiltrated Japan."



"What..."



This surprised Kazama even further.



“The police who were standing guard at the Kansai International Airport detected illegal immigrants using telepathy, and these two passengers were on a direct flight to Japan. And I think that one of them is an infected member of STARS."



"... I need to tell Her Excellency(Saeki).”



"I think that would be wise."



The police in the Hanshin area didn't keep the information to themselves. It was reported to the National Police Agency, where it was then reported to the Ten Master Clans. Whether the police would share information with the military is a subtle thing. At times, it’s not a good thing for the police to borrow the power of the National Defense Forces. So in all likelihood, there was a high possibility of Saeki eventually purchasing the detailed information through a private route.



"So who is the other person?"



"The other part of the duo is Raymond Clark."



"...Is that true?"



“I have confirmed this with a photo taken by the police, so there is no mistake.”



"Lieutenant."



Fujibayashi, who had previously stood silently in the back, opened her mouth, when she got a ‘weird’ reaction.



"Is this Raymond Clark related to Edward Clark?"



“Yes, he is the son of Edward Clark, the creator of Project Dione.”



Tatsuya once again told them what he knew.



“He is one of the ‘Seven Sages’ who uses the information collection system ‘Hliðskjálf’, which is the backdoor to Echelon III. He also used this system to reveal my identity as Taurus Silver.”



“...Wait, Special Officer, this is far too much information, my head can’t keep up with this.”



"The main topic starts now."



Tatsuya ruthlessly refused her, and in a way whispering: ‘I won’t let you take a break’.



"Continue on."



"So, I, as a member of the Yotsuba Family, request for cooperation with the National Defense Forces’ Independent Magic-Equipped."



Their eyes emitted a strong light, when they heard that he made the request as a representative of the Yotsuba Family.



"We believe that it is highly likely that the parasites that have entered Japan are going to collaborate with Minoru."



When she heard Minoru’s name, all blood vanished from Fuyibayashi’s face. It was likely that she already knew about Minoru, but in the end, Tatsuya felt that there was no need to take her feelings into consideration.



"Moreover, it is unlikely that only one person from STARS have been sent to Japan to conduct illegal activities."



When mentioning this, Tatsuya excluded Raymond from this number of people.



He isn’t taking Raymond lightly, he predicts that when Raymond became a parasite, he gained power that can’t be ignored.



Tatsuya just doesn’t think he is one of them, and they will only use the power of STARS.



“We should send reinforcement there without fail, so that we can be in the immediate area.”



"I think so too."



His guess was logical, so there was no objection.



"Minoru’s goal is definitely to get Minami, who is one of our members."



Tatsuya shifted the focus of the discussion from STARS to Minoru.



“If STARS were to join Minoru in going after Minami, it’s possible that she can't be defended with the power of the Yotsuba Family alone.”



"Do you wish for us to send soldiers for support?"



"No. If STARS attempted to invade either the military bases in Zama or Yokosuka, would the military be able to stop their intrusion?"



The Yotsuba Family monitors the private and metropolitan airports and air bases.



But it’s only the National Defense Forces who can monitor outside of this area, for even if they can't get inside, it would take time and effort to do so in the current situation.



Whereas its more reasonable to trouble the military to monitor the bases to prevent the intrusion of foreign troops for illegal activities, for it is something that should be easier for them to do since they’re allies.



“─ I understand. I will pass this military order on to Her Excellency.”



The reason that he didn’t demand any alternate conditions from Tatsuya was because he understood that should be the work of the National Defense Forces.



"By the way, what do you think about the recent war?"



"Do you mean who I think will win or lose?"



“That's right."



"The New Soviet Union will win."



Tatsuya didn’t show any doubt, and he replied immediately. He had time to think about it before he came to the base.



"Please tell me your reasoning."



“The invasion of the Great Asian Union is based off uncertain information about the absence of Igor. But this very thought is wrong. The moment he joins the battle, the morale of the soldiers of the Great Asian Union will fall."



More specifically, this is the moment Tuman Bomba will be used.



He didn’t need to say this, because they already understood this.

"Hm... so you don’t think the possibility exist that the conflict will be settled before Bezobrazov returns?"



“There is no definite difference between the military forces of the two sides, whether it be the military of the New Soviet Union deployed in the Far East or that of the Great Asian Union's military. Even then, if the Great Asian Unions were to use ‘Thunderclap Tower’, it would be difficult to win in such a short period of time and that only time would tell who would be victorious.”



Furthermore, ‘Thunderclap Tower’ is a magic attack that was used by their previous nationally recognized Strategic Class Magician. Its destructiveness can be compared to ‘Scorched Halloween’ ─ ‘Material Burst’ ─, but Liu Li Lei, the granddaughter of the previous user of this magic, Liu Yunde, also uses this Strategic Class Magic, making her the Great Asian Union’s newest nationally recognized Strategic Class Magician.



"If the New Soviet Union were victorious, they would try to invade Japan ─"



As he said this, he looked straight into Tatsuya’s eyes.



"Can the National Defense Forces depend on you if that time comes?"



“No problem, you can count on me.”



Even at a time like this, Tatsuya didn’t hesitate.



When he needed the power of Toudou Aobo, he had made an agreement to deter any military campaigns of other countries. So even if Kazama hadn’t asked him as a member of the 101st Brigade, he would have still taken the necessary measures.



But he did not need to say this. It was a good opportunity to make it look like Kazama was ‘borrowing’ his power.



◇ ◇ ◇



The day after the invasion into the territories of the New Soviet Union by the Great Asian Union.



In the New Soviet Union's coastal region of the Far East, the New Soviet Union's forces were on the retreat.



The world was paying attention to the conflict and among them, it’s said that Japan has been observing with strong interest and vigilance.



The rules prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons since World War III by the International Magic Association are still in effect.



The International Magic Association would only intervene when ‘dirty nuclear weapons’ are going to be used. These specifically are biological weapons and chemical weapons that pollute the environment, large-scale bombs that produce harmful residues, and

thermobaric explosives that release harmful substances. Modern war is mainly based on old-fashioned bullets, bombs that clear debris, and expensive ‘environmentally friendly’ high-power explosives. If the military can afford them, electromagnetic weapons and laser weapons will also be utilized.



In other words, you could say that old-fashioned weapons are still mainstream. But what is also common, is that a war can take a long time if fought against a ‘decent’ army. In this case, ‘decent’ would mean ‘stable’.



Thus, in order for one side to defeat the other in a short period of time, weapons that the other side don't possess are needed.



The source of victory is Liu Li Lei, the user of ‘Thunderclap Tower’, a Strategic-Class Magic.



The Great Asian Union predicted that the Strategic Class Magician from the New Soviet Union couldn’t make a move, which is exactly what the military experts had also deduced.



However, victory wasn't settled in just one day. The Great Asian Union introduced their Strategic Class Magician on the first day to promote dominance on the battlefield. However, ‘Thunderclap Tower’ isn't a magic that can encompass every battlefield. Even with the existence of such a magic, its use is difficult to utilize in land battles where the enemy is approaching friendly forces.



As such, Strategic-Class Magic isn’t always as convenient as other people in the world believe.



Today is Saturday. In contrast to the previous time period where this day was for leisure, some middle and high schools are still open on these days.



First High is one of these high schools. Tatsuya had dropped Miyuki off at school in the morning and Minami was still in the hospital with no set date for her release by the Yotsuba Family. Despite Tatsuya no longer being a ‘Guardian’, he still accompanies Miyuki to school as a bodyguard.



Even though Tatsuya doesn't need to be in close physical proximity to Miyuki in order to protect her, he still feels weary about Igor's attack from the time before. Therefore, escorting her is an effective countermeasure every morning, and because of his strong personality, he likes doing it.



After escorting her to First High, Tatsuya went back home to change out of his school uniform and into more rough clothes. He then took the air-car straight to Miyaki Island. His first goal was the magical research laboratory, as he was worried about keeping his eyes off Lina for too long.

Sure enough, Lina had gotten bored already.



"...Tatsuya. What are you doing?"



"Creating a new magic."



It was for no particular reason─ to Tatsuya ─ that Lina came to the place where he was working.



"You’re only using a computer?"



“Is that surprising? Doesn’t the engineer who created the ‘Brionac’ also do something similar?”



Brionac is a magical weapon that uses the FAE theory as the basis of its workings to make the Strategic Class Magic ‘Heavy Metal Burst’ able to work in close range combat.



In Japanese, it is called the theory of controlling phenomenon after they have been created, but Free After Execution is a better way of expressing it. The phenomenon produced as a result being transformed by magic is already a phenomenon that was not originally in this world, and immediately after transformation, the shackles of the laws of physics are loose.



This is also the theory behind his Baryon Lance, but Baryon Lance was created with the Brionac as a reference. Tatsuya felt strongly about the creator of the Brionac as his opponent and deep within his heart he would like to meet this person.



“Surely Abby is also remodeling magic at her own desk.”



Is the engineer who developed the Brionac an ‘Abby?’ ── Tatsuya secretly wrote down the name in the notepad in his heart.



"Although when you create a new magic, don't you repeatedly experiment?"



The engineer, seems to still be still creating new magic. ── Tatsuya also adds this to the notepad in his heart.



"Even this magic, is not created from scratch."



Every time Tatsuya would hear about ‘Abby’ the engineer, he would get interested, all while answering Lina's questions.



“Since I had the opportunity to see Tuman Bomba a while ago, so I thought that I could apply it to another magic that we can use as well, since Tuman Bomba is too complex to use easily.”



Tatsuya ment this in the sense that ‘it cannot be used easily because a large machine is required’, but Lina interpreted it as ‘the amount of magical power required is too high so it can’t be easily used’.



But her interpretation wasn’t wrong either.



"...Eh?! Wait a minute… The magic you are trying to create, is it a Strategic-Class Magic?"



After a single beat, Lina spoke out of tone.



"The classification is as such."



Whether Tatsuya had gotten used to it, there was no such thing as him laughing out loud.



"Amazing."



Lina's shoulders sharply rise while laughing, "I'm amazed."



"Great Bomb... No, I wonder if it's 'Material Burst'. Even though you also have a deterrent magic, are you trying to acquire a new Strategic-Class Magic? Are you going to become a Demon King?"



"Is Lina a gamer?"



"Even if you don't play g-games, everyone knows what a ‘Demon King’ is of course!"



The number of people who wish to treat him as a Demon King have increased, and Tatsuya was starting to get a little tired of it.



"I myself won't be using the magic."



"Eh, is that so?"



"It's as you say, Lina. Strategic-Class Magic, it's not enough to have one. Such a thing, even though it’s useless due to its limited use, it comes with a catch the size of a mountain."



"I know."



Lina ignored the context and strongly agreed.



"When it's completed, it will be used by another magician."



Tatsuya hid his wry smile with a seemingly plausible expression.



"I know that there are those who can use it. If his or her name were mentioned, they would become a new Apostle’ and the current amount of depressing things will decrease a little."



"Well."



Lina was too distracted by his ‘shamelessness’ to be able to pay attention to the essentials.



A new nationally recognized Strategic-Class Magician is to be born in Japan and in one sentence: It will bring great change to the military balance of the world.



◇ ◇ ◇



Tatsuya only stayed on Miyaki Island during the morning.



The new Strategic-Class Magic isn't complete yet. Tatsuya doesn't think so highly of himself, that he thinks he has the ability to create a new magic in a day or two. Besides, he has a new magic that's far more important to complete than the new Strategic-Class Magic.



“I would like to train with you today.”



"That’s fine."



Saturday afternoon, in the exercise forest after school.



With Mikihiko as his partner, Tatsuya wants to work on completing the ‘Seal Ball’ that Yakumo had suggested.



The magic would compress the parasites that are expelled from the body and confine them in the mind.



The magic would compress the parasites that are expelled from the body and confine them within the mind. The ‘Seal Ball’ is a physical seal by means of having the parasite confined by getting sucked into it like a curse; where the spirit of the parasite is decomposed and then incinerated. Even then, further steps in the process are required. But once trapped, Tatsuya's job is finished and an expert can take over.



Overall, the training itself is self-explanatory.



Mikihiko summons spirits and deliberately pours in power to create a runaway state. Tatsuya would then go and restrain them with Non-Systematic Magic to compress the spirit, putting it into a stable, frozen state. In addition, the Information Body is covered with Psions that are then mixed with the spirit, combining everything together.



Is it like trying to contain radioactive waste by surrounding it with glass?



A separate container, an object for sealing, needs to be prepared beforehand. Thus, enabling the preservation and storage of the parasite that would then later be separated from the container, and then processed thus rendering it harmless. This prevents the parasite from flying away and eroding the mind of other humans.



"I can feel that I’m getting closer."



Tatsuya had started on Thursday and was far from completing the magic. He was getting there little by little while tinkering with it.



"Is that so?"



Tatsuya doesn't respond to the praise that was given to him by like he always does, but he still recognizes that the magic has progressed since his time compared to when he visited Yakumo.



"Yes, I’m sure of it."



"...There’s no point in being negative. I will help you as much as you want."



"As much as I want..."



Tatsuya wasn’t dissatisfied with these words and they continued training.



Thanks to the help of his friend, Tatsuya managed to get to even closer to the completion of the ‘Seal Ball’.



[Seven]



It was Sunday morning when Tatsuya received word from Fujibayashi.



"Special Officer. The USNA military has notified us that a transport plane from Hawaii will arrive at the Zama Base tomorrow. They used their agreement for the search of Major Sirius with us to make the arrangement."



“Well it seems like we have no time to rest.”



"I guess you could say that."



As expected of STARS, they used their agreement with Japan in order to send more reinforcements to find Lina. However, given the fact that this request came directly from STARS shows that the influence of the parasites has grown considerably within the USNA.



Fujibayashi had a very concerned look on her face.



"Well, please tell me when you would like me to go there."



“Special Officer. No... Tatsuya. Do you really plan to take them all on by yourself?"



"It will be okay if I go alone, I have been working with someone to perfect a countermeasure that can be used against parasites.”



"Is that person from the Yotsuba Family? Or one of your school friends...?"



“My family is focusing on something else.”



Tatsuya didn’t give a clear answer, he didn’t want them to bother his friend that he needed. Although he had come closer, ‘Seal Ball’ is still unfinished, so he still needs someone that can capture the parasite itself.



Fujibayashi decided to just drop it.



She thought Tatsuya had no intention to tell them anything, but that he ‘will catch the parasites’.



"...When will you be there?"



"As soon as they get there tomorrow, immediately after their arrival."



"Okay… Tatsuya, please be careful. If you need any support, Major Yanagi will be on standby."



"I understand, if support is needed, I will be counting on him."



Saying this, Tatsuya tried to make the mood less dire.



However, Fujibayashi understood what he truly meant.



Tatsuya won’t be relying on their support.



"Yes. But I hope that won’t be necessary. ”



She didn’t want to leave this situation up to luck. It was her job to trust her own judgement to make sure her troops would succeed.



Still, she couldn’t force herself to say any of this.



Having finished the conversation with Fujibayashi, Tatsuya decided to leave.



Even while she was there during the call, Miyuki was still uncertain on some areas.



“Onii-sama... What should I be doing tomorrow?”



Six months ago, the old Miyuki would have never had asked this. She would have either expected to tag along with Tatsuya or make up an excuse to join him no matter what. But Miyuki has since realized that she is one of Tatsuya’s weaknesses and she doesn’t wish to be a burden to him anymore.



“Look after Minami.”



This was Tatsuya’s decision. He doesn’t believe that Miyuki needs to fight against STARS



It’s not that he thinks she is inferior to them, because he knew she wouldn’t be beaten by the top of STARS.



However, he doesn’t want her to take any unnecessary risks. This was the true intention behind Tatsuya’s words.



If you attack, it is inevitable that you will also be attacked.



So not getting involved is the best solution.



However, the situation with Minoru is different. If she defends Minami from Minoru, it won’t get her involved with the USNA.



This would also mean that the USNA’s parasites won’t go after Miyuki.



“We still haven’t confirmed Minoru’s whereabouts. I want you to keep an eye on things at the hospital, while I am fighting another battle.”



“Understood.”



Miyuki had heard what he had said.



However, she knew what his real intentions were.



Miyuki also understood that she didn’t want to bother him while he is completing his mission.



"Onii-sama, I will do as you say."



Having understood this, Miyuki promised to follow Tatsuya’s instructions.



◇ ◇ ◇



Minoru, who had left Regulus and Raymond behind, headed to Nara alone. Zhou still has some connections in Nara that Minoru was able to use. Last autumn, he had collaborated with Tatsuya to uncover a part of it, but the power of ‘wealth’ was still useful for ‘ordinary people’, who posses no magical power.



Minoru is currently residing in a private house that belongs to such an ‘ordinary person’.



"He really was a strong opponent...."



Thinking about Zhou, Minoru started to talk to himself.



Like Minoru said, he really was a formidable opponent.



But now because of him, Minoru was able to move around comfortably.



He made it as far as he could safely, but he is now about to enter the territory of the Kudou Family, who are waiting for him.



His destination was the Ninth Research Institute, or rather the 9th institute used for magical research, the place where the magic of the magicians of ‘9’ has come from.



Here, he intended to take more of the sealed parasite dolls that have been kept here.



After the fight against the Saegusa and Juumonji families, Minoru strongly realized his limitations. Even though he made an agreement with Raymond and Regulus, they had their own work to do, but two extra men won’t make that big of a difference. And he also wanted to have his own people.



So, Minoru realized that he should use the parasite dolls.



Even though the production of the parasite dolls was stopped, because of the ethical reasons behind it, since a parasite doll, like the name suggests, is a parasite and something that dangerous shouldn’t be used as a magician, this didn’t mean that the Kudou Family stopped perfecting the ones they already had.



The parasite dolls, which were damaged during its test, were repaired and sealed in the warehouse of the former Ninth Institute. Even if they were sealed, he could just unseal them, but the problem lies with trying to escape, which would be difficult to do with just his own power.



Even after the Kudou Family stepped down from the Ten Master Clans, the Ninth Institute still remained under their control.



Even if they don’t know that Minoru would go for the dolls, the former Ninth Institute will still be heavily guarded by the Kudou Family.



His grandfather Kudou Retsu must be waiting for him.



If you don’t enter a tiger’s den, you can’t get its cub.



And the former Ninth Institute is definitely a ‘tiger’s den’.



◇ ◇ ◇



The head of the Yotsuba Family, Yotsuba Maya, entrusted the investigation of the illegal immigrants to the Kuroba Family.



Kuroba Mitsugu, the family head of the Kuroba Family had two excellent twins.



The older sister, Kuroba Ayako. And the younger brother Kuroba Fumiya.



They were both second year students at Fourth High School and go to school on the weekdays.



When Maya asked them to lead the investigation, they thought that ‘If the task is given to us by the Main House, we can give it priority over school’.



But they weren’t having a lot of luck with the current guessing game that they were playing.



Sunday, June 30th.



Ayako and Fumiya had come to Kansai International Airport.



"We haven’t gotten any good leads."



"Even when we looked at the identity of the illegal immigrants who had been photographed, they barely had any information about what happened after the fight."



Ayako, who had no real gratitude for the work the police had done, listed her problems with them to her younger brother.



Their direct contact in the case was Kurosawa, the person who discovered Regulus and Raymond. After they had dined with him and learned about what happened during and after the time of their discovery, it was up to them to continue their search.



By the way, the one who invited them to dinner was Kurosawa himself.



"It seems like you knew that police officer from before, didn’t you?"



"It was just a coincidence that I knew Kurosawa from before.”



Her familiarity with him has to with a previous mission.



Ayako stayed near Tatsuya for a month during the summer holiday when she was in junior high school three years ago. In this vacation, she was in a school that was for girls of the same age.



Of course, work was involved. It was a disgusting investigation.



Ayako had finally completed her mission to clear out an unlawful criminal organization that was brainwashing upper-class children to turn them into their operatives. At the time, Kurosawa was still in training but was also investigating this case. That’s when they met.



The dinner bill was paid for by the Kuroba Family. After leaving the police station, the two of them were having tea alone.



"But in the end, this didn’t give us any clues, did it?"



"It wasn’t without any clues."



Fumiya asked Ayako to explain with an impressed expression.



“The two men suddenly disappeared from sight after they closed in on a manned taxi and none of the people pursuing them had seen them enter a passenger car. And while the men were recorded leaving, they had a different appearance than what was recorded at the airport. When that car drove off, the cameras outside of the airport didn’t see that same taxi again."



Fumiya interrupted his sister and looked in the eyes.



"Does this look like a situation where magic has been used?"



"...The Kudou Family’s ‘Parade’."



“Yes, and there is only one person from the Kudou Family who would cooperate with parasites.”



"He became a parasite the other day and fought with the Yotsuba. Kudou Minoru, it can only be him."



Ayako answered Fumiya, and she was convinced that this was the correct answer.



“The illegal immigrants are people from STARS that have come to Japan.”



To Fumiya’s claim, Ayako showed agreement.



Fumiya and Ayako reported their hypothesis that the STARS members that invaded the country were being helped by Minoru of the Kudou to their father, who is the head of their family.



As a result, their father told them to stop investigating, then he instructed them to return and to go to the former Ninth Institute to give them this information and to patrol the area at night.



Needless to say, they were giving priority to going to the Institute.



"...Anyways, I wonder if the Kudou Family is going to help us?"



While they were in the car heading to the Institute, Fumiya unconsciously let out her skepticism. They were in a car, not a taxi, one their family used. Fumiya and Ayako had left the convenience of their home to go live in an apartment. They didn’t go to Kansai by train today, but they used a car that they had taken when they left their family’s home. It took some extra time, but this was natural when you consider that the Institute was located in a rather awkward place outside of the city.



"I hope we get to speak with His Excellency, and not with his son."



These words by Fumiya were more like a monologue, but Ayako still answered him.



In addition, the ‘son’ refers to current head of the Kudou Family, and the father of Kudou Minoru. His Excellency refers to Kudou Retsu.



He is revered as the leader of the Japanese magical world, and is give the title the ‘Patriarch’, but Tatsuya hates this name and calls him ‘His Excellency’. He also used to be the general of the National Defense Forces.



Ayako and Fumiya used to call him the ‘Patriarch’, but when they heard that Tatsuya calls him ‘His Excellency’, they also started calling him this.



Since they used a car and not the train, and because they hadn’t had dinner, it was already dark when they arrived at the former Ninth Institute. They currently were in the sunniest period of the year, but the sky before the rain season is always cloudy, which prevents any sunlight from going through.



Like they had thought, Kudou Retsu had been waiting for them, and he had immediately responded to Ayako’s offer and let them in.



Ayako and Fumiya walked to the living room. In a short amount of time, they had explained why they came to the former Institute, despite it being a Sunday.



"There currently is some tension in our family, especially when we think about what Minoru has done..."



Among his grandchildren, he liked Minoru the most. But he felt sad that, although he was blessed with magical talent, he wasn’t able to demonstrate it because of his health.



Perhaps other grandchildren wouldn’t like to hear this.



But maybe they already know this.



From an objective point of view, it cannot be said that Retsu gave everyone in his family and adequate amount of love. Perhaps in the Kudou Family, he had only directed his love to Minoru.



"It's already late. Would you like to have dinner here?"



Having finished their conversation, he made a suggestion to Ayako and Fumiya. The two may have felt sorry for him that he was alone in such a situation and Ayako felt that Fumiya also wanted to. So she didn’t have the courage to refuse them.



"I’d gladly get some food ready for you."



"...Thank you. Then we shall accompany you."



In the end, Ayako accepted his invitation as to not hurt their feelings.



◇ ◇ ◇



(The sun will be setting soon...)



Minoru was hiding in the shadows, while observing the Ninth Institute from a distance.



The area was now completely dark, because the sun was about to set.



And thick clouds covered the sky.



Indeed, this really made him look like a demon.



When a person meets a demon and gets defeated, the demon becomes stronger.



Minoru started to go over the operation and his objective.



There currently are only a few Ancient magicians with the ability to bind parasites to a body in Nara. Most of them were magicians who came here with the help of Zhou and his connections. Since he wasn’t around anymore, they decided to head back to the mainland.



Tatsuya and Katsuto have no way of completely binding a parasite. They may have some other means to subdue one of them, but in that case it would escape by using the method of igniting itself. This self-destruction does destroy the body, but the parasite itself will not be destroyed. This was also part of the reason why he wanted to get more parasites.



Minoru walked to the front gate of the Institute.



Normally the attack he was about to use was suicidal.



But even if he had used it, he wouldn’t die because his body would be able to heal him.

Using magical power beyond your own limit while also using this magic at point-blank range.



Instead of getting a wound that could kill him if left unattended, he demonstrated his power by breaking the gate with only one blow.



◇ ◇ ◇



Ayako and Fumiya who had just finished their meal looked towards the direction of the Ninth Institute.



Retsu did as well but it was only Fumiya that jumped up.



"Why isn't the proximity alarm working?"



In other words: ‘Why isn’t the alarm warning us that a suspicious person is approaching?’



"... Could it be related?"



When no one else said anything, he answered his own question.



There was a magic barrier that was supposed to be practically undetectable.



The field interferes with magical waves. It covers a vast area around the Institute and about half of the outside area. They realized how serious the situation was.



“It is a cover-up barrier which was setup by some of the best of Japan.”



"Your Excellency, I think Minoru has come."



It was Fumiya who reminded Retsu why the barrier could have been turned off.



“If it is Minoru, his aim must be the Parasite Dolls.”



“Do you mean the humanoid weapons that were tested at last year’s Steeplechase Event?”



“Did you know?”



“Yes, I had some involvement in it.”



Ayako turned it into a quick interrogation.



"Oh, then that would make this somewhat easier."



After answering Ayako’s first question, Retsu started monologuing about the past:



“Was Fumiya the one that stopped us that time...? Well, sorry, the parasite dolls are sealed in the warehouse on the north side, could you help me? I will come as soon as I have finished checking up on the situation on the inside of the institute.”



"We understand."



There was no real reason for the two of them to obey him.



However, Kudou Minoru is also an enemy of the Yotsuba Family.



If Minoru is going for the parasite dolls, then his aim must be to build up his own military strength by getting extra followers.



So it is the natural duty of the Yotsuba Family to prevent an enemy from obtaining more military strength.



"Let's go, sis!"



"Okay."



Ayako agreed to Fumiya’s plan of action.



◇ ◇ ◇



The security of the former Ninth Institute was not an opponent that Minoru could take lightly.

But ──



(This nothing compared to Mayumi-san and Juumonji-san.)



It only took a short while but Minoru arrived at the warehouse where the sealed parasite dolls were kept.



The other day, when he became a parasite, this kind of lock wasn’t here. He saw the electric lock and felt that he had been careless.



(── No, wait.)



Just to be sure, he decided to take a couple of steps from the gate that leads to his new helpers to make sure he couldn’t get hurt, and released ‘Golden Electron Silkworms’ that he had gotten from Zhou.



‘Golden Electron Silkworms’ got near the electric lock.



Immediately after that, a powerful electrical discharge could be seen near the lock.



(... That is dangerous)



It seems like the current voltage is strong enough to be able to kill someone.



Even Minoru, if he had accidentally touched it, he would have been incapacitated for a while.



(You wouldn’t be able to activate any protection magic fast enough if you were to be attacked by this… Is that the intended purpose?)



Perhaps it had been set up by his grandfather, Kudou Retsu.



As expected of the former ‘best in the world’.



Nevertheless, Minoru noticed that the electrical current had destroyed part of the console so he decided to use ‘Golden Electron Silkworms’ again, and again he created some distance. Being close to such a high electrical current still is very dangerous. However, the console had been damaged by the previous discharge, so his ‘Silkworms’ could enter now.



He once again used ‘Golden Electron Silkworms’.



The electronic circuit of the console that was used for the electric current had indeed been destroyed.



The silkworms were able to activate the signal to open the door, and they were Minoru’s invitation inside.



At the same time when he passed through the door, Minoru’s afterimage was attacked.



Unlike the other day, it seems like they had also placed guards inside of the warehouse.



Moreover, these weren’t one or two people. Instead, he felt the presence of 5 or 6 people, coming for his head.



(It’s great that they thought this far ahead, but this won’t be enough to stop me.)



In his mind, as someone from the Kudou Family, he felt that he couldn’t kill these people.



The battle was over in less than a minute.



The six magicians had all lost consciousness.



◇ ◇ ◇



Fumiya and Ayako did not go directly to the warehouse, like they said they would.



Instead they went to a nearby parking lot where their personal vehicle was that they used to get here.

Fumiya grabs his CAD that best brings out his ‘Direct Pain’.



"Young master."



“Kudou Minoru has shown up! Contact the Yotsuba Family head and my father, after that, wait here and make sure we can leave if necessary!”



"I understand."



Without further instructions, the black clothed young man turned away, having understood his purpose.



Fumiya took the black knuckle-duster from the glove compartment near the back seat.



He put it on his right hand.



Slightly changing, this specialized CAD fit perfectly inside of his hand.



"Sister, if you will!"



"I understand."



Ayako points to the north side of the site.



"That'll be enough."



From their current position to the warehouse.



"I will go by roof."



"Well, my older sister shouldn’t push herself too much."



"I will remain vigilant."



Fumiya have her an anxious smile, and then Ayako sent him away using ‘Mock Teleportation’.



Fumiya disappeared.



And he almost instantly appeared again on the roof which was 8 meters away.



◇ ◇ ◇



Minoru sensed powerful magic being used towards the warehouse.



(Mock Teleportation?)



It isn’t a magic used for direct attacks but more often used to send fighters to certain locations faster.



Someone was on the roof.



However, Minoru didn’t care about that and instead focused on the magic he was working on.



"──Done!"



Suddenly, he said this.



Immediately after that, a hole appeared in the ceiling of the warehouse.



The material, able to withstand explosives, was destroyed by his magic in mere seconds.



The magic he was using is called ‘Oxidation Decay’, this kind of magic is a specialty for him. It removes electrons from solids and deprives them of intermolecular bonding. Although it’s power wasn’t as great as when Minoru used it himself, with his new abilities through the parasite, the magic has become more practical to use.



“Kuroba Fumiya!”



Minoru watches as this figure jumped to the other side of the hole he just made. He recognized him from last year’s Rookie Monolith Code event.



Fumiya didn’t respond to Minoru and thrusted his fist out forward.



(A knuckle-duster?)



A black painted glove was attached to his fist, but he was more than ten meters away. Minoru was confused and didn’t know what Fumiya was doing.



Suddenly, Minoru was struck by immense pain.



(Was I struck in the stomach somehow?)



Minoru changed the controls of his body, more directly, the connection between the brain and the nervous system in order to cut off the pain.



(The pain won’t go away!)



However, his abdomen is still in pain.



(This is bad!)

Feeling threatened by this unknown attack, Minoru fired off a series of ionized air bullets called ‘Plasma Bullets’ at Fumiya.



However, Fumiya quickly shot down all of the ‘Plasma Bullets’, and once again thrust his right hand towards Minoru.



"Goodbye!"



Feeling an incredible amount of pain, Minoru put his right hand over his right eye.



He had a pain in his right eye that felt like it had been crushed, but this sensation didn’t line up with his findings that his eye was fine.



Minoru kneels down in pain.



(I lost?)



His head was filled with the feeling of defeat.



How could this happen?



Without any ‘hope’, and in order to achieve his goal, Minoru used a spell that was basically a self-destruction spell.



◇ ◇ ◇



Fumiya’s ‘Direct Pain’, which directly damages the mind, was very effective against parasites.



It was unexpected that he couldn’t defeat Minoru with one blow, but he was kneeling down with two shots. Even if someone was looking at this from the outside, it would have been clearly shown that Fumiya was one step away from victory.



However, when Fumiya was about to launch his third ‘Direct Pain’, he felt a strong sense of danger.



It wasn’t just his intuition, he could tell that a large area around the warehouse was caught up in Minoru’s magic.



(Really!? NOx Out!?)



Fumiya yelled this in his heart.



‘NOx Out’ is a magic that causes NOx, or nitrogen oxide, to appear around him.



Specifically, it is an absorption magic that forces oxygen and nitrogen in the air to combine.

The compounds produced nitrogen dioxide, which is extremely toxic, and is mainly used with magic to create nitrogen monoxide. However, nitrogen monoxide is also toxic. If you breathe it in, you lose consciousness in a few minutes. Because of this feature, it is called ‘NOx Out’ or ‘Knockout.



The effect of this magic on humans is not only a loss of consciousness due to nitric oxide. By consuming a large amount of oxygen in the air it also creates an oxygen-deficient condition. In enclosed spaces, this magic can cause a large amount of damage.



Minoru designated the whole warehouse in his range and released his magic. He didn’t need to specify any safe zones around him, which one would normally do.



(Are you trying to commit suicide!?)



Fumiya felt insulted, but he had yet to take in the fact that parasites could rely on their vitality and healing power when they used this ‘repulsive tactic’.



He went to the entrance and pressed the button to open the door. He was lucky that Minoru had only destroyed the external console, and that the system on the inside was fine.



The door’s logistics worked without a problem and it opened smoothly.



When Fumiya jumped out of the warehouse, he still moved away by about twenty meters just to be safe.



◇ ◇ ◇



Minoru’s body had stopped working after the nitrogen monoxide affected his central nervous system and he was exposed to oxygen deficiency. But the parasite within him did not lose its ability to recognize what was going on around him.



(You guys, go!)



Minoru ordered the sixteen parasites to start fighting.



Minoru has just released all their seals. They were only frozen in the first place, so once unfrozen they were ready for combat.



In the meantime Minoru returned the nitrogen oxide in the warehouse back to normal oxygen and nitrogen.



When the air became breathable, his healing ability started working automatically.



He collapsed face down and began to raise himself with his own hands.



“If I had been a human being, I would have been defeated.”



Minoru muttered this in a bitter and weak voice.





◇ ◇ ◇



It took Ayako only a minute to travel fifty meters.



Their true enemy was in a one on one battle.



But it seems like there were also other magicians here. These were Ancient magicians from the mainland.



Ayako’s ability is not suited for direct confrontations. Her ability to use wide-area magic is great, but this isn’t the right situation for it.



Nevertheless, she wasn’t about to hide or run away. She is capable enough to support the magicians fighting alongside her.



She cut off the enemies who were attacking one by one, and she took a breath. These fighters weren’t necessarily weak, but they were decently competent. Ayako thought that the minimum requirement needed to defeat her would be competence.



There were also some fighting alongside of her. There was one person, who was facing seven enemies. However, those seven people weren’t fighting at the same time, and they kept getting knocked down one by one. They had no cooperation at all.



In addition, the attack patterns of the enemies were all the same. Ancient magic is a type of magic that is an expert at controlling the opponent’s five sense, and beating them with a surprise attack that they couldn’t block. But this magic still loses to modern magic in terms of speed.



The leader of the enemies is probably using this. Nonetheless, Ayako was being attacked by a variety of things, such as fireballs, electrical shocks that emit light, and wind that can influence the air currents.



"I wonder if they are being controlled?"



Magic, which deprives the enemy of their own ego to turn them into a slave for battle, exists in the Yotsuba Family. The fact that their leader can control them to such an extent shows his aptitude.



She made herself remember that Kudou Minoru has the ability of hypnotic suggestion. She made a mental note and resumed her battle.



But before she could even take three steps, Fumiya was seen jumping out of the warehouse.



The parasite doll leading the attack on him was a female doll.



Ayako knew her.



It wasn’t a combat magician.



A parasite doll. A human-like existence that uses demonic magic.



A number of parasite dolls followed the female doll and attacked Fumiya.



Another group split off and faced Ayako.



◇ ◇ ◇



Fumiya shouldn’t be trying to defeat the parasite dolls. Minoru is the one who is in control of the group. These dolls are an autonomous weapon, so if you were to defeat Minoru, you can overwrite their previous orders with the help of the Ninth Institute.



However, even if Fumiya tried to slip past the parasite dolls in order to get to Minoru, the parasite dolls would not allow it.



As soon as he jumped in the air in order to escape, two parasite dolls followed after him at an even greater speed. Fumiya noticing the signs of magic, jumped to the side, but the parasite dolls took notice of his movements and mirrored his own actions.



These parasites specialize in specific magics. In respect to that, they are closer to being supernatural-power users than magicians. The mobility of one of these parasite dolls is specialized and clearly surpasses Fumiya’s skills.



(Can they feel pain?)



Fumiya launches ‘Direct Pain’ at the approaching parasite doll.



But there was no change in the behavior of the parasite doll.



(Did I miss?)



Fumiya was feeling frustrated.



In this interval, two parasites caught up with him.



One of the parasite dolls waved their left hand, and steel threads extend out from inside its wrist.



Fumiya reflexively cast a shield to deflect the attack.

The steel threads, hidden in the darkness, wound around Fumiya from above the shield.



The other parasite had a spear type weapon, but at the end it had two separate blades with a narrow space in between.



Light appeared between the two blades.



The parasite doll threw the short spear that was simultaneously releasing an electric discharge.



Fumiya headed straight towards the parasite doll that cast the steel threads.



The threads loosen as he gets closer, and by rotating himself counter-clockwise, he unwound the steel threads.



The other parasite doll is coming up from behind Fumiya, with their blades drawn.



Fumiya leans forward to avoid the blades, but in the next moment the parasite doll with the steel threads wrapped its arms around Fumiya.



The parasite doll falls to the ground with its arms still wrapped around Fumiya.



Fumiya tried to use ‘Direct Pain’ on the parasite that clung to him.



But──



Again, it had no effect.



(This won’t work on them!?)



Fumiya finally figured it out, his ‘Direct Pain’ is a magic that directly attacks the mind and makes the body feel pain. The parasite dolls cannot feel this pain, because it is housed inside a humanoid machine, with no pain receptors.



Before the impact Fumiya casted ‘Inertia Control’ but it was insufficient. He was only able to reduce the damage enough to avoid fracturing any bones.



“Fumiya!”



Ayako’s desperate scream stopped Fumiya from thinking about his current situation. When he looked in Ayako’s direction, she was completely surrounded by three parasite dolls.



Her ‘Mock Teleportation’ has no function that allows you to slip through physical obstacles, so she is unable to get away.



Ayako had called out to him because she was concerned about his fall, even though she herself was in danger.



“Get out of my way!”



Fumiya was boiling with anger.



So he yelled out to her.



Fumiya was able to shake off the parasite doll attached to him but using ‘Acceleration Magic’, the other parasite doll was struck in the face as Fumiya passed by it.



"That was a warning!"



He cut the face of the parasite with a knife he had in his hand. His CAD has two parts, the one is used for his actual CAD, the other part can be used to carry a weapon.



He didn’t chase the parasite that he had just stunned.



Instead, he activated self-acceleration magic.



He quickly reached one of the parasite dolls that was surrounding his sister.



Right before his fist made contact, a repulsion field was cast on that parasite doll. This ended up destroying it’s core.



With the source of its power turned off, the doll stopped working.



The parasite was shaking silently and then continued to fall down.



Fumiya, who had broken a part of their setup, pushed through using his knuckle-duster CAD, and stretched his hand towards Ayako.



"Ayako, we’re going to leave!"



Turning around, Ayako noticed that she was no longer being contained.



Ayako used this opening to cast ‘Mock Teleportation’, and they both disappear from the area.



And right before Fumiya left, he thought he heard Minoru scream.



◇ ◇ ◇



Minoru recovered from his paralysis with the healing powers of the parasite inside him. He now turns his attention to the outside of the warehouse.



The battle continues, and it’s clear that none of the parasite dolls have been destroyed yet. It seems that using the parasite dolls against Fumiya was the right call. Minoru’s goal today was to strengthen his fighting force, so he has no need to win the fight. He plans to make his escape while the parasite dolls keep his opponent occupied with ‘Ghost Walker’.



Minoru heads towards the entrance of the warehouse, and suddenly feels sluggish as if he was drunk.



(Is ‘NOx Out’ still in effect? No, that’s not it.)



Minoru doubted so, but this is without a doubt a symptom of nitric oxide, and it was magic used by someone other than himself.



‘NOx Out’ is normally a very small scale magic, so this would need to be in effect in the vicinity of Minoru’s head. He had perfected this intricate magic without it being taught to him by others.



Minoru generated a descending air current and blew the nitrogen oxide and oxygen deficiency that was occurring around him. And as he searched for the magician who attacked him, he senses someone near him.



“Grandfather!”



The man stood not more than two meters away from Minoru.



Minoru couldn’t believe that Retsu was able to appear so close to him without him realizing it.



“I didn’t expect that you would be able to notice me… it truly is regrettable.”



Retsu was behaving as if he wasn’t in front of an enemy.



“I didn’t really appreciate you, did I?”



Retsu was filled with remorse and sorrow.



“I don’t think you have realized your worth. You never really understood what you were looking for.”



“I loved you.”



“I felt sorry for you.”



“I thought, at least, that I must protect you.”



“But…..”



He turned and lifted his face, as if to look at the sky.



It seemed like he was trying to stop himself from tearing up.



"I must have been mistaken."



The words telling him the opposite couldn’t leave Minoru’s lips.



── That’s not it grandfather.



── You have done nothing wrong grandfather.



In the end, however, he couldn’t say this.



He felt that he is no longer able to talk to his grandfather like that when he is no longer human.



“I know you were the kind of person that wished to accomplish something in your life, rather than stay sick in bed. My affection for you must have felt like a burden to you.”



"............"



"But, Minoru..."



His tone suddenly changed.



"I can’t accept the way you are now!”



His regret has become his enemy, and his enemy can’t be left alone.



"I can’t call you a human anymore, and I will not overlook the existence of this demon that looks to take revenge on this world."



"Grandpa, I'm still me!"



He had no intention to harm the world. But as Retsu spoke, he was unable to keep quiet.



“The Ten Master Clans have decided to capture you without killing you, but if you are to be imprisoned, it likely that you will be treated like an experimental animal. It would be too much for me to bear.”



Minoru was shocked to hear all of this from his grandfather.



He also understood his grandfather’s intentions.



“It's a pity, but your grandfather will be your guide to the netherworld.”



Signs of magic could be sensed.



Minoru’s human heart tried to accept what was coming.



But his spirit as a parasite refused to perish.



Minoru suddenly regained consciousness. Or it might be better to say that he has regained his sense of reality.



It felt like he had been sleeping, while standing.



The fighting was still going on outside the warehouse.



The time spent listening to his grandfather didn’t seem like it lasted more than a few minutes.



He looked around his own body.



His clothes were covered with burns and tears, but his wounds were already healed, so even now the parasite’s healing power was doing its work.



He looked up.



In a direct line in front of him.



A lone figure was lying on the floor of the dark warehouse.



Who is that? Was the first thing to came to mind.



But he got a response quickly after that.



"Grandfather!￼"



He yelled and ran up to him.



Although he fell on his stomach, he quickly grabbed him with his hands.



But no matter how much he tried to move his shoulders and wake him up.



He knew.



My grandfather is dead.



I killed him.



"NOOO!"



A scream came out of his mouth.



Minoru’s heart was in anguish.



His heart felt as if it was breaking, because he recognized the horrible fruits of his labour.



Minoru, who attacked the Ninth Institute, left the institute with fifteen parasite dolls.



What was left behind, was a piece of Minoru’s heart and a former great magician ──



It was the corpse of Kudou Retsu.



◇ ◇ ◇



“His Excellency Kudou has died….”



Tatsuya learned about what happened at the Ninth Institute late that night when Fumiya called him.



"Yes… I couldn’t do anything...."



"That’s wrong, Fumiya."



Tatsuya wanted to try to calm Fumiya down.



Tatsuya’s words is what Fumiya needed.



To Tatsuya, it didn’t seem like he had done anything wrong.



"You did well, in addition to fighting Minoru, you also had to deal with a group of parasite dolls, so your retreat was inevitable."



"... Is that true?"



"Yes."



"... Thank you, Tatsuya-san."



“Don’t worry too much about His Excellency. This was originally an issue for the Kudou Family, and that there is no need for the Yotsuba Family to take responsibility for what happened at the former Institute.”



"Okay..."



Then Ayako, who also came on screen, also reacted to the words of consolation.



This call was taken in Tatsuya’s room, so Miyuki wasn’t here to hear the news.



It was already late in the evening so he decided to tell her tomorrow.

Tatsuya also wanted to analyze the information given to him while it was still fresh in his mind.



──Minoru stole fifteen parasite dolls.



Tatsuya is familiar with the parasite dolls’ fighting abilities. They can share a single will with their telepathic abilities, and become a stronger fighting force when they work together.



Moreover, it is the parasite Minoru, who has these same abilities and is leading the group. It isn’t too hard to imagine, but this will not be an easy opponent to deal with.



[Eight]



On Monday at First High, the entire school and possibly all Magical High Schools are mourning the death of Kudou Retsu, respected as an ‘Old Master’ whom was a symbolic existence to the Japanese Magic Community.



Earlier in the day, during lunch, Tatsuya was at a lunch table discussing about Kudou Retsu with his friends.



"I didn’t know that he was sick..."



After Mizuki said this, Honoka tried to change the topic.



"Did you know, Tatsuya-san?"



"No, I didn't and even when I was talking on the visi-phone with him I didn’t notice that he had a special condition."



The cause of death was announced to have been death from illness, as it would be a plausible reason, since it couldn't be said that he was killed by his grandchild because the child would be made out to be a monster by others.



"Is that so...?"



"Are you and Miyuki going to attend the funeral?"



To Erika's question, Miyuki opened her eyes.



"I haven’t heard anything about that… But why would we?"



"Since you are a member of the Ten Master Clans, and Tatsuya is your fiance, I don’t think it would be weird for you guys to be invited to the funeral."



"Oh, I see, I forgot about that."

Leo’s expression showed that he was convinced of Erika’s reasoning.



"If I am invited, I will attend, but it would be to pay my respect to him for helping me during the Nine Schools Competition two years ago."



Tatsuya was talking about the time he assaulted a member of the board who was trying to use ‘Golden Electron Silkworms’ on Miyuki’s CAD.



In fact, there was another big problem during last year’s Competition, but he hadn’t ever talked about it, so it was unnecessary to mention it now.



"Ah, that is important ..."



When this situation was mentioned, Shizuku remembered what had happened two years ago during the Nine Schools Competition.



She remembered how she was defeated by Miyuki.



But the topic of the Nine Schools Competition isn’t a happy one. This year’s Competition was canceled, and it can’t be said that Tatsuya was uninvolved in the matter.



“The Competition may have been canceled this year, but in a sense it also gives us the opportunity to mourn the Master.”



However, the girl that mentioned this wouldn’t really care about this ─ No, Erika may have been trying to say the opposite.



“Rather, it would be the opposite, because he liked the Nine Schools Competition.”



Thus, Tatsuya and Erika had the same line of thought.



Lunch break had ended and everyone was getting up from their chairs.



"Hey Miyuki, Tatsuya?"



Erika wanted to talk to Tatsuya and Miyuki about something.



"What is it?"



"Uhm"



Erika had a dry mouth when she wanted to respond to Miyuki’s question.



She immediately realized that it was difficult to ask them this in front of everyone.



“If you want to talk, use the headquarters of the Public Morals Committee. No one should be there currently.”



Mikihiko mentioned this.



He seemed to have an idea about what Erika was trying to ask.



"Let’s go, Miyuki."



"Okay Onii-sama, Erika, shall we go?”



Tatsuya got Miyuki, and Miyuki got Erika.



"Okay."



Naturally, Erika had no problem with this idea.



As Mikihiko said, the headquarters was empty.



Using the key belonging to the Student Council President that Miyuki has. She, Erika and Tatsuya entered the room.



Miyuki then created a sound insulation field that covers the entire room.



They sit down at the long table and it’s completely clean going of Mikihiko's personality to keep things tidy compared to the mess that existed when Tatsuya had first entered the room.



Then Erika started talking,



"I heard about what you’re doing tonight from Mikihiko."



Miyuki turned around and looked at Tatsuya’s face, who was sitting next to her. He didn’t look particularly surprised and just sat there.



"What will you be doing, Miyuki?"



She wanted to know what Miyuki will be doing tonight, because this was something Erika didn’t know and was interested in.



"I will accompany Minami-chan until Onii-sama returns."



"To watch out for Minoru?"



"Yes."



"Then I want to do that too."

Erika wanted to go. Not as a guide, but to fight.



"Can I come?"



She knew that she was asking a lot from them.



"To Minami?"



"Yes."



"Tonight?"



"Yes."



Erika continued to speak quickly after this.



"I know Leo will be near Mikihiko in order to protect him so he wouldn’t be defenseless."



Tatsuya hadn’t heard this part of the story from neither Leo nor Mikihiko. Perhaps they were going to mention this to him after school.



"Do you really understand what you would be doing?"



"Of course."



He knew that Erika can be both brave and reckless, so Tatsuya treats her like Leo.



"If you really understand what you’re getting yourself into, then I would like your help.”



Erika, who anticipated Tatsuya to be opposing her request, was somewhat surprised.



Erica looked from Tatsuya to Miyuki.



"How about you?"



“Erika: I'm not used to fighting, like Onii-sama, so I can’t protect everyone, even if you are in a tough spot, are you still fine with that?”



"No, on the contrary, I wasn’t going to be protecting you either."



"...So what do you think, Onii-sama?"



Miyuki left the decision to Tatsuya.



“What Erika does, doesn’t really bother me.”

Tatsuya looked at Erika.



"Are you prepared for what’s to come?"



"Of course."



To Tatsuya’s provocation, Erika responded with a fearless smile.



This was a bluff made by Tatsuya. He didn’t believe that Minoru would be making a move on the hospital anyways based off the events of the day before.



The ones at a higher risk will be Mikihiko and Leo.



◇ ◇ ◇



That night, near midnight, a starry sky was out.



The moon hasn’t come out yet. But it was supposed to come out at around midnight.



Tatsuya is at a parking lot, at a large park two roads across from Zama Base. It’s on the other side of the base where the base isn't visible from the parking lot.



"Leo, are you good?"



Tatsuya saw Mikihiko and Leo arrive together and he just asked this even though he wasn’t really worried.



"You don’t need to worry about Mikihiko, so don’t force yourself for my sake too much, okay?"



Leo, who was listening to Tatsuya, seemed displeased.



“Originally, I didn't want to involve you and Mikihiko.”



"But you need us?"



To this question from Mikihiko, Tatsuya reluctantly had to admit that he was right.



Mikihiko would have probably been a little more subtle and say something like,



"If I was alone, and if you were busy, I could still be attacked, but with Leo there, that risk would disappear."



Though Mikihiko uses distance magic, by use of a spell, if he were to get attacked in a counterattack it would be up to Leo to get involved.

"I didn’t have a choice."



He knew that complaining now was useless. He had already confirmed Leo’s resolve after school.



In addition, it could be troublesome if he needs to be concerned about Mikihiko while moving around the base, so having someone protect him is perfect ── And at the moment, Tatsuya finds Leo more reliable than the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.



“I will rely on you this time, Leo, so protect Mikihiko for me, okay.”



"Yeah, leave it to me."



"Oh, I will."



He got on his motorcycle. Both the ‘Freed Suit’ and the motorcycle ‘Wingless’ that Tatsuya is wearing and riding are developed by the Yotsuba Family. The strategy for this night is supposed to be unrelated to the 101 st Brigade. Though reinforcements have been deployed, they won't appear unless a real emergency appears, otherwise they are set-up in hidden positions.



"I’ll be back."



He closed the visor of his helmet and started his motorcycle.



A USNA military transport airplane had just arrived and it has slowly been moving down the runway. Fujibayashi had looked before at the arrival and departure records and found nothing and that no other military aircraft had landed in over a week and that this is the only one.



(It’s about time they came.)



A parasite was definitely on board of the plane. Like Minoru, they emit an unfamiliar wave pattern. But is it really the same?



(Four parasites in total, less than I expected but only one of them stands out because it posses a high level of magical power....)



Tatsuya, who was observing with Elemental Sight, did all of this while on his motorcycle along to road beside the base and chose to switch ‘Wingless’ to its flight function before the parasites got off the plane.



◇ ◇ ◇



Getting off of the transport aircraft that landed at Zama Base is Alexander Arcturus, the Captain of the STARS' Third Unit.



(Have we been spotted...?)



One of the people in the vehicle, Arcturus, started to monologue. He didn’t say this out loud, but in his heart.



He can feel that there's movement nearby, but can't make visual contact within his line of sight.



If he is being watched by a magician, this could explain it.



So he used the magic, ‘Multi-scope’, that allows the user to monitor the area without blind spots from various angles, and it’s made out to seem like a number of relay cameras in the air. It is the same as being monitored simultaneously by multiple magicians, though this doesn't mean that there is no particular direction.



Arcturus now felt something but he wasn’t able to discern what it was or where it came from.



However, he could still feel it.



It seemed as if he was staring at a God or Devil.....



This was probably the reason that he was distracted by this ‘gaze.’



"What is it?"



“Is that a motorcycle or….￼”



Arcturus was not aware of the approach of a strange flying object, until one of his co-passengers told him.



A small silhouette could be seen on a monitor in the plane.



When the alert system automatically used its automatic zoom and night vision function, they saw that an ‘object’ was approaching their vehicle.



A motorcycle was flying across the sky, with the shadow of a single person on it.



The person raised their arm that looked like it was holding a handgun.



Suddenly a hole appeared in their transport vehicle.



The person then jumped off the bike.



Jumping off its motorcycle onto their vehicle, and then into the cabin through the hole that he had created.



Moments later, the alarm system inside of the plane went off.



◇ ◇ ◇



Tatsuya who was flying towards the transport aircraft and pulled out his specialized-type handgun CAD from his suit holster.



His ‘Silver Horn Custom Trident’



He used his ‘favorite CAD’ to activate ‘Decomposition’.



He created a hole just large enough for him to jump through into the plane.



He switched his ‘Wingless’ to its autopilot mode, and jumped into the hole.



Landing on the floor of the plane in a slightly prone position. Immediately after this, the hole in the wall of the transport plane disappeared.



It was repaired with ‘Regrowth’.



He locked himself in the room of the plane so as not to let any Parasites out.



An American soldier in the cabin who was sitting there didn’t know what to do and neither did Tatsuya immediately.



But this soldier was a parasite.



Tatsuya rushed at the parasite who was closest to him.



He holstered both CADs.



He had a thin, short, needle-like knife that he held with his right hand with a fine patterns carved onto the narrow blade.



The parasite, who Tatsuya was going for, started to activate magic to try to fight back.

Then Tatsuya stuck out his left fist, and not the fist holding the knife.



But before impacting the parasite, the left fist that was clenched before, now opened.



At point blank range, the parasite was defeated with an ‘Armor-Piercing Psion Bullet’,



The parasite let out a scream.



And it was then pierced under its left clavicle that Tatsuya had held in his right hand.



◇ ◇ ◇





"It’s coming... !!"



In the parking lot, two roads across from the base, a seal that Mikihiko had prepared reacted.



This seal allows him to find out that a parasite was nearby.



The thin, short, needle-like knife Tatsuya had, was a tool that has a curse on its blade.



In Mikihiko's left hand is a fan, the item paired with the cursed knife.



He pulls out a charm that's reacting in his right hand and activates a sealing technique.



◇ ◇ ◇



The parasite that had been convulsing, stopped as if it were like a puppet whose strings had been cut.



The parasite collapsed on the floor still with the knife pierced under its clavicle.



The inside of the body had been disturbed by the Psions from the ‘Armor-Piercing Psion Bullet’, meanwhile the sealing technique was causing the spiritual and physical links to start trembling as it was flowing in.



Even if the knife were removed, the sealing technique couldn't be removed since it’s been engraved into the bone.



With the magic skills of Mikihiko, he was able to have the parasite remain asleep in a state of suspended motion.



Did we just hear our colleague scream?



All the American soldiers reached for their waist all at once immediately.



They all reached for their guns without any hesitation.

Tatsuya then decomposed more than 20 assault carbine and submachine guns at the same time.



Once they lost their guns, in their heart, the American soldiers drew a blank.



Tatsuya then went on to ‘process’ the second parasite during this time, and thus the repeated convulsions and weakness appeared when it was being sealed.



He then moved onto the only owner of the magical power that was alarming.



◇ ◇ ◇



Arcturus couldn't understand what was going on in front of him.



Suddenly a hole opened up inside of the transport vehicle and disappeared as if he was dreaming.



However, the attacker who jumped through the hole hadn’t disappeared.



A distance away, newly added colleagues, former Stardust members were sealed in a short time.



Those from Stardust with an experimental body are just awaiting death.



They were supposed to escaped from their inevitable deaths when they became parasites.



The friendly soldiers on-board aimed their guns at the intruder.



They weren't parasites, but to them it looked as if the intruder had killed one of their own even if he was just in a sealed state.



The number of muzzles pointed at the intruder was over 20. No one would be able to escape from them within such a narrow plane. Even if one were to be wearing a bulletproof vest, at this range, they wouldn't be okay when shot at.



Then, at that moment, a powerful magic was used throughout the cabin, it wasn't just powerful, it was accurate, with no waste, a truly pristine magic.



More than 20 assault carbine and submachine guns fell apart into pieces. The magazines spit out bullets and those rolled out over the floor. No bullets were fired from the guns.



Once again, the unexpected situation that Arcturus was seeing, was the killing of his friends by once again, a marvelous magic.



Then Arcturus took out his Tomahawk to slash at the intruder.



His forte is to fight at mid-range with ‘Dancing Blades’. Though he originally is well-known for his use of Spirit Magic to remotely control weapons to attack his enemies, for this, magic of the Mental-Interference System isn't great for direct attacks. Fighting in such a narrow space as a magician isn't good.



But he isn't a weak ‘magician’ that can only use magic. He was inexperienced in melee combat with a Tomahawk until he had joined STARS.



Wielding his Tomahawk, grasping it and swinging it down in intervals.



He thought that even though the intruder wouldn't be defeated with a single blow, they wouldn't be able to avoid the timing of the swings.



However, not only did the intruder not get hit, they disappeared from right in front of Arcturus.



He then turned to look at his back.



What Arcturus saw was a scene where he saw that his third friend was grabbed and a knife was stabbed under their left clavicle with the intruder’s right hand. He then saw that his friend’s body started to convulse.



── Thus, his last companion had also been sealed.



It wasn't the intruder in front of him that was using magic to seal them.



Even if he were to defeat the intruder in front of him, the sealing wouldn’t be stopped.



This thought flashed through Arcturus’ mind.



Arcturus threw the Tomahawk in his hand.



The Tomahawk broke through the wall of the transport vehicle and it flew into the sky.



◇ ◇ ◇



Tatsuya looked back at the signs of a strong magic.



The third seal had completed and there was nothing more to do beyond that and it was only natural for him to go after the final and strongest Parasite.



However, the magic from the fourth person wasn't directed at him.



Unbelievably, the Tomahawk broke through the wall of the plane and flew out into the night’s sky.



Wondering what the person was trying to do, Tatsuya used his Elemental Sight to trace the Tomahawk.



He then pulled out his knife to attack the person, his opponent being Alexander Arcturus, the Captain of the STARS' Third Unit.



When consciously releasing Elemental Sight, the information appears in Tatsuya's ‘eyes’.



Unlike with Lina and Minoru, he doesn't possess the ability to camouflage his information body.



He attacked Arcturus' knife that was coming at him.



His ‘Freed Suit’ includes a fully thought-operated CAD that was attached to his CAD holsters.



At point blank range, Tatsuya ‘decomposed’ Arcturus’ knife into sand.



An ordinary soldier, not a magician nor a parasite appeared behind Tatsuya.



Tatsuya turned his body and threw the solder at Arcturus from where he was standing.



Arcturus catches the soldier.



Tatsuya then releases a penetrating shock-wave from his first upon the back of the soldier.



In martial arts, Tatsuya’s technique is but an imitation of that of a master but his also incorporates magic.



Even if it was an imitation, this still made the power the same.



Arcturus’ bulky body, at 185 centimeters tall, was knocked back.



Tatsuya reaches out, pulling the soldier by the neck with his right hand and then, in reaction, thrust out his left hand at Arcturus.



An ‘Armor-Piercing Psion Bullet’ was in his hand.



Arcturus gasped.



Stretching out the fourth dagger with his right hand, Tatsuya tried to pierce Arcturus’ left clavicle.



But Arcturus’ left hand blocked it.



Though the ‘Armor-Piercing Psion Bullet’ is effective, it wasn't enough to make Arcturus lose his combat strength.



In fact, he started to collect plasma in his right hand.



This would result in Lightning strikes that are used in Ancient magic.



(So since you are still able to counterattack, does this mean you still have some kind of independency from the parasite?)



Before the electric shock was released from Arcturus’ right hand,



Tatsuya struck out his left hand at Arcturus’ solar plexus again.



Arcturus started to collapse.



The electricity that was once in his right hand, had disappeared.



Once again Tatsuya had repelled Arcturus, managing to allow for him to pierce under the left clavicle with the knife in his right hand.



Confirming the operation of the sealing technique.



Tatsuya then escapes from the transport through a hole in the floor, without confirming the results with the naked eye.



◇ ◇ ◇



"Something’s coming!"



While raining his voice, Mikihiko tensed up.



Leo fully focused his five sense while asking, “what?”



Then he caught the sound of something cutting through the wind.



An object was approaching at high-speed.



Even at this speed it wasn’t as fast as a bullet or missile, but it still exceeded 200 km/hr.



It was still moving quicker than a baseball that’s been hit or even slightly faster than a tennis ball that’s been served at high-speed.



Leo had decided to apply his experience in dealing with such speeds.



Leo's eyes grasp that a Tomahawk, the something that Mikihiko yelled about, was approaching.



It was a rotating Tomahawk.



In the corner of his eyes, he also caught the appearance of several soldiers that were hiding.



But Leo did not wait for them.



It was an instinctive behavior for him to stand out in front of the Tomahawk for Mikihiko.



This wasn’t his survival instinct.



But his fighting instinct.



"Siegfried!"



Leo hardened himself.



Extending both hands of his hands towards the object, his hand was able to grasp the Tomahawk, thus intercepting Arcturus’ ‘Dancing Blades’.



The product an Ancient Magician strengthened, Leo was able to catch this with his reinforced body when using Siegfried.



As a result, Leo's Convergent Reinforcement Magic was able to overcome the trump card of Alexander Arcturus, the Captain of STARS' Third Unit.



Leo confirmed that he had completely stopped Tomahawk; Leo then got down to the ground.



However, he did not release the Tomahawk that he was holding at the top of the blade and at the handle.



Mikihiko didn't notice that Leo had become his shield.



He concentrated on sealing the parasites. It must have been due to him being convinced that Leo would protect him.



Thus, Arcturus who tried to intrude through Zama Base was sealed along with three other parasites.





◇ ◇ ◇



An aircraft carrier made port at Yokosuka Base where the USNA’s Armed Forces are stationed.

They arrived at night due to departing for training in advance, which is what was reported to the Japanese side.



But they had not been notified of this.



The state-of-the-art multi-seat VTOL fighter was on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier.



The Japanese army did not know that this was a plane launched from a super-large sized submarine with a flight deck.



The Japanese military wasn't informed of this and didn't know that the aircraft that was supposed to have a radar interception officer and a weapons system officer, instead had several female officers aboard the multi-seat fighter aircraft.



These three women were,



Charlotte Vega

Zoe Spica

Leila Deneb



The female officers from STARS were turned into parasites after Lina left the USNA. They infiltrated the Yokosuka Base on Monday night of July 1 st , 2097.
