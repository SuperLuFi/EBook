Summary: The story follows Tatsuya Shiba, a bodyguard to his sister Miyuki Shiba who is also a candidate to succeed the master clan, Yotsuba. They enroll into First High School which segregates its students based on their magical abilities. Miyuki is enlisted as a first course student and is viewed as one of the best students, while Tatsuya is in the second course and considered to be magically inept. However, Tatsuya’s technical knowledge, combat abilities, and unique magic techniques causes people to view him as an irregular to the school’s standardized rankings.

Modern Magic




Hell of Fire and Water (Inferno): A magic which reverses the heat energy within a set area. Areas of bitter cold and scorching heat occur concurrently in adjacent regions.



Niflheim: A Wide Area Deceleration-Attribute Oscillation-System Magic. The specific heat of the material within the area, regardless of attribute (Phase) is cooled evenly. As a result, a large mass of cold air which contains a fog of liquid nitrogen, Diamond Dust (Ice Needles), and dry ice particles is formed.



Dry Blizzard: A magic which collects the carbon dioxide in the air to produce particles of dry ice. The dry ice flies at high speed by converting the thermal energy produced by the freezing process into kinetic energy.



Thunder Snake Path (Slithering Thunders): Like [Dry Blizzard], stones of dry ice are produced and water vapor is condensed. This combination magic utilizes Oscillation-System and Dispersion-System Magic to melt the ice, creating a fog of carbon dioxide which has a high electrical conductivity through which a static charge is run through.



Rupture: A Dissipation-System magic which evaporates all liquid within an object. In the case of living organisms, body fluids will evaporate and the body will explode. All fuel will vaporize in internal combustion engines or fuel cells. Since nearly all machines have a fluid of some kind, such as lubricants, coolants, hydraulic fluids, oils, or battery fluids, they will instantly be destroyed by [Explosion] or simply stop working.



Flight Magic: A magic to move through the air via gravity control. It was once thought to be impossible, using a very short duration (a default of 0.5 seconds) of magic invoked in rapid succession, the difficulty caused by an increasing Interference Strength was cleared. It is possible to continue flying so long as the operator’s Magic Power is in supply.



Vanishing Clouds, Fog Dispersal (Mist Dispersion): By interfering with the structural information, this magic decomposes substances into molecules such as ions and the basic elements. Direct interference into the structural information of an object is a form of magic of the highest difficulty.



Magic Dissolution (Gram Dispersion): This magic takes a Magic Ritual and decomposes it into a group of Psion particles without a meaningful structure. Due to the nature of a Magic Ritual acting on the information of an object accompanying a phenomenon, if the information has not been exposed, it is impossible to interfere with the magic. On the other hand, if the Magic Ritual is decomposed, the phenomenon will not occur. To analyze the magic before the magic is activated in the present age where invocation takes a fraction of a second requires the ability to [See] and analyze the magic structure. Since the user is typically required to understand the magic being used beforehand, it is thought utilization of this magic is impossible.



Magic Dismantling (Gram Demolition): A mass of compressed Psion particles are thrown directly at an object and explode. Any Activation Sequence or Magic Ritual recorded into the Psion Information Body is blown away. Though it is called magic, it is simply a cannonball of Psions that has neither structure nor a Magic Ritual to modify an event, so it is not affected by Zone Interference. Furthermore, the pressure of the cannonball also repels the effects of Cast Jamming. It has no physical effects and cannot be hindered by any obstacle.





Nine-Schools Competition




Official Name: [Nationwide Magic High School Athletics Competition]. As its name suggests, students from First to Ninth High School gather from all around the country. It is a team competition with fierce magic games.

Unique events include [Speed Shooting], [Crowd Ball], [Battle Board], [Ice Pillars Break], [Mirage Bat], [Monolith Code], six in total. [Monolith Code] is men’s only, [Mirage Bat] is women’s only.

The number of people participating in each event is three per school, and each player can participate in two events. The competition is held over a period of ten days. There is also a set of games in which only freshman play in, the [Rookie Division] (the Official Division has no grade restriction). The [Rookie Games] will be held from the fourth to the eighth day. Victory or defeat of the school is determined by the total points. First Place receives fifty points, Second Place receives thirty points, and Third Place receives twenty points. Speed Shooting, Battle Board, and Mirage Bat award ten points to Fourth Place. Accel Ball and Ice Pillars Break reward five points for each victory of any team who makes it to the third round. The primary game of the Nine-Schools Competition, Monolith Code, grants one-hundred points for First Place, sixty points for Second Place, and forty points for Third Place due to it being a team game, thus giving it the most weight (The Rookie Games are worth half the points and are added to the overall ranking).

Speed Shooting: Amongst the Players, this game is called [Quick Draw]. A clay target is shot into the designated space and destroyed by magic. One-hundred red and white targets are released and the Players compete by destroying their colored targets. In the Preliminaries, Players only compete to destroy as many targets as possible within a five minute time limit. Beginning at the Quarter-finals, the scoring system is put into place as contestants compete against each other.





Crowd Ball: Amongst the Players, this game is called [Crowd]. A 6 centimeter diameter foam ball is shot into the competition area using compressed air. Players compete by using a racket or magic to force the ball to hit the opponent’s court. 1 set lasts 3 minutes, and a ball is shot into the court, covered in a transparent box, every 20 seconds, leading to 9 balls being on the court simultaneously. Women have 3 sets per match while Men have 5 sets.





Battle Board: Amongst Players, this game is called [Surfing]. This game originated as a method for training the naval forces. Players receive a board similar to a surfing board and must complete three laps on an artificial channel three kilometers in length by making full use of magic to propel them forward. Players compete for victory. According to the rules, use of magic to interfere with other players is forbidden. The Preliminaries consists of six races, four players each. Two Semi-finals games are held with three contestants each. A playoff will be held to determine third place, while the top Players from each Semi-finals race will compete one-on-one in the Finals.





Ice Pillars Break: Amongst Players, this game is called [Pillars Break] Each Player stands on a tower four meters in height, defending twelve pillars contained in a twelve meter square area while attacking twelve pillars in the opposition’s field. Players compete to destroy the opponent’s pillars before their own are broken. There is no need to use the body, since Players compete remotely with magic, so Players may wear whatever they wish, with the only restriction being that [It Must Not Offend Public Order or Morals]. It is said the Women’s Pillars Break had become a Fashion Show in recent years.





Mirage Bat: Amongst Players, this game is called [Mirage]. It is a women’s only game. A holographic sphere is projected in the air, and Players must compete by using magic to rise into the air and hitting the orbs with their sticks. Though this competition has the fewest number of games of all in the Nine-Schools Competition, the play time is typically the longest. During the game, Players must continuously invoke magic to leap into the air. It is said the burden is similar to running a full marathon. The Nine-Schools Competition Mirage Bat is an event held only amongst women. With their elaborate costumes and how they fly around, they are often likened to fairies.





Monolith Code: Amongst Players, this game is called [Monolith]. It is a men’s only game. At the competition site, called a [Stage], magic is used to fight over the [Monolith], with each team having three players. The outcome is determined by splitting the monolith in the enemy encampment and transmitting a concealed code. Any attacks other than magic are forbidden. Breaking the monolith requires that it be struck with a special Non-Systemic Magic. Due to the nature of the event, this game is the most popular amongst the Nine-Schools Competition.





Chapter 8




It’s the fourth day of the tournament.

There’s a break before the finals, five days from now, and the fight between the 1st Years in the Newcomer’s Battle will take place in the meanwhile.

So far the results stand with First High being at number one with 320 points, Third High being at number two with 225 points, and the positions of third place and below being a wild free-for-all between the other schools. The difference between first and second place is a massive 95 points. However, the battle is such that even that point difference could potentially be reversed if Third High is able to win the Newcomer’s Battle by a large margin, which for them is not impossible. Conversely, even if First High doesn’t manage to win, yet they avoid a huge difference in points, final victory would still be theirs.

The aim for every school is overall victory, but in this case, as only half the points gained from the Newcomer’s Battle will be added to the overall ranking, to the competing 1st Years what they are fighting for in the Newcomer’s Battle is their own glory. The spirit in these matches is in no way inferior to the finals themselves.

The order is the same as the finals.

Today’s events are Speed Shooting (Qualifier, Finals) and Battle Board (Qualifier).

They differ from the finals in that the schedule for Speed Shooting includes the women’s event in the morning and men’s in the afternoon, with everything being finished in one stretch (the reason being that the Speed Shooting finals is carried out straight after the opening ceremony, and there’s no way to finish everything by the morning.)

Not just Speed Shooting, but CAD adjustment cannot be carried out in the middle of any event, so the major work of fine tuning whilst listening to the contestants’ specifications is done by the engineers in between matches.

That’s why engineers are basically always around the players they’re responsible for during the match. In order to ensure as much as possible that contestants from the same school in the same competition are not competing at the same time, the Convention Committee have made numerous adjustments to the timetable.

However, in events like Crowd Ball where many matches would occur in a day, overlaps can’t be helped, and engineers would often be paired as a duo of main and sub.

This can occur even in the same competition, and one engineer cannot be responsible for another match occurring at the same time.

Even if that match ostensibly occurs at an unrelated time.




“Honoka is in the last race huh……”

“Yes! It’s in the afternoon, so it doesn’t clash with the women’s Speed Shooting!”

Honoka, grinning earnestly while subtly emitting an overbearing pressure, made Tatsuya relive the heat of being popular.

Tatsuya was responsible for the women’s Speed Shooting, women’s Icicle Destruction, and Mirage Bat.

He didn’t get himself assigned to that host of women’s events because he was a womanizer, but because there was a strong backlash against him from the men’s 1st Year division.

Not only that, but he was in high demand amongst some of the women’s 1st Year contingent.

For example Miyuki, Honoka, Miyuki and Honoka, Miyuki and……in other words, those two had appealed rather earnestly.

But here lay a problem.

Miyuki’s sheer magic power was most suited for the competition Icicle Destruction.

Both her classmates and the council knew full well her proficiency in slowing down vibrations. When all is said and done, cooling magic is pretty much second nature to her.

Miyuki’s participation in Icicle Destruction was decided, as well as in Mirage Bat as the star athlete and ace of the women’s team — the problem was what Honoka would participate in.

In terms of First High’s practical results, in first place was Shiba Miyuki, second was Kitayama Shizuku, third was Morisaki Shun, and fourth was Mitsui Honoka. Therefore amongst the 1st Year female students Honoka ranked right alongside both Miyuki and Shizuku in practical excellence, but in truth her skills were not particularly suited for a sporting magic competition.

Her specialization in magical illusions involving manipulating light was impressive, but Shizuku’s ability in high output vibration and acceleration was more suitable for Icicle Destruction.

It was a given from the start that Tatsuya would be responsible for Miyuki. Not even the seniors were foolish enough to try and challenge that.

So in order to be looked after by Tatsuya, it’s most reliable to get into the same competitions as Miyuki, but for the number one, number two and number three top players to appear in the same competition is not a very sound strategy. ……or rather, it’s impossible.

Therefore it would fall to a competition which does not overlap, but unfortunately, Shizuku was also more suited for Speed Shooting. The competition had initially called for contestants to enter in their field of expertise, so you could say she had little hope of being considered from the start.

Following that train of thought, it was decided that Honoka would compete in Battle Board and Mirage Bat. (The organizers had at first floated the idea of Battle Board and Crowd Ball, but due to her own wishes and the vocal support of her friends, she was able to get into one event with Miyuki.) ……In a situation like this, with her line “the events won’t clash”, just what is Honoka really trying to say, Tatsuya wondered.

But even if the time was compatible, from a team perspective, changing the engineer responsible at this late stage was impossible.

And even if today was alright, on the sixth day — the third day in terms of the Newcomer’s Battle — no one could guarantee that there wouldn’t be an overlap between Icicle Destruction and Battle Board.

Honoka too should have been well aware of that, but……

It seemed that Miyuki was not about to come to his rescue today. Faced with Honoka on one side and his sister on the other, each with a different motive, Tatsuya sighed and came out with a bifurcated response.

“……I’d like to maintain your CAD in truth, but that’s not possible, so I’ll watch your race at the least.”

“Really? It’s a promise!”

Someone gave a small ominous laugh. Tatsuya knew more than well whose voice that was, but his consciousness chose to pretend he didn’t.

From an outsider’s perspective, maybe he really was a “womanizer”…… probably.




Although the parties involved would never think of it as “trivial”, from the perspective of the main story, this was just a side episode.

When the curtains rise, one must be absolutely focused.

With the final checks complete, Tatsuya handed over the dedicated Speed Shooting CAD shaped like an elongated rifle, and confirmed its condition with Shizuku.

The CAD absorbs psions from the magician, which the Psion Information Aide transmits into the Activation Sequence. If a problem occurs in this process, no matter how well the other parts are serviced, it’s pointless.

If the problem occurs with the hardware it has to be replaced with a spare device, and if the problem lies in the software it has to be reworked on the fly.

“Nn…… perfect. It feels better than my own.”

As both her face and voice were rather deadpan, after initially being paired with Shizuku, Tatsuya had sometimes been confused as to whether she was serious or not; but now he was pretty much used to it.

Basically, she doesn’t lie.

In the worst case, she would simply remain silent.

“Tatsuya-san, you won’t consider being hired?”

However, in cases like these, he still can’t get used to whether she’s serious or joking.

“If you’re in a position to joke like this right before the match, you’ll be just fine.”

“It wasn’t a joke.”

“……”

By the way, what she was saying had the meaning of “formally signing on a contract to perform CAD maintenance”.

Shizuku had asked him “won’t you be hired” more than 10 times already. Considering her personality, Tatsuya had thought it a long running gag, but now it seemed that wasn’t the case.

“It won’t be an exclusive contract so you don’t have to worry.”

In order to make references for CAD arrangements, Tatsuya had taken her CAD in hand and adjusted it.

Before that, the one who had maintained Shizuku’s CAD was a famous engineer who could be ranked amongst the top five in the country.

Or rather than Shizuku, it would be more accurate to say the Kitayama house.

When Tatsuya had first heard he was not surprised, but then again Shizuku’s family were “extremely rich” after all.

In the first place, the mages of the Kitayama house did not hold the same prestige as the Ten Master Houses or the 100 Families.

Shizuku’s mother, a magician, had fallen in love with her millionaire father at first sight, and after much strife they were finally married, at which, the paternal lineage turned up no mages — her young brother having some measure of practical ability but not enough for true magic.

Whether because of those circumstances, in contrast there was Shizuku — her raw magic potential being extraordinary.

Shizuku’s addiction to Monolith Code could be said to stem from her father’s financial prowess, being able to tour the country seeing magic competitions every year.

“……I think I’ve said this numerous times, but that would require me to have a license wouldn’t it?”

When Tatsuya did not respond, Shizuku had presented him with a down payment and contract fees which even considering his position as part of Taurus Silver and the considerable income that came with it, was an unprecedented sum.

If he had been just a normal student, that dazzling amount would have made his eyes water.

But although doing this as part of a school event meant he received no compensation, it would have been different if he took it as a real job with remuneration. It’s not illegal to work without a license, but in the eyes of the world, he would be seen as a “fake”.

“I understand.”

As always, Shizuku gave a dutiful nod.

But whether she truly understood was doubtful.

What it was for Shizuku only she herself knew, but for Tatsuya it was a conversation that significantly lowered tension in the moments before the match.

Well, whatever the effect, as long as nothing adverse happened it’d be nice.

They had gone through strategic meetings many times before.

For Shizuku, Tatsuya had devised a CAD and a secret plan to go along with it. (The début of the “plan” was meant to be in the finals of the tournament, but still.)

“You’re up, Shizuku.”

“Yeah.”

There was only one thing to say in this moment before her time.

“Alright, do your best!”

“Yeah, I will!”

It was simple, but that was also a strategy of last resort.




“Is this seat available?”

“Ah, Miyuki. It’s fine. Go right ahead.”

In truth that question had been asked to the sitting girls by various people for a while, but unlike the one asking now all had various ulterior motives (if you don’t mind sitting between Leo and Mikihiko!). In this rather menacing way, Erika had scared off countless lying chick cruisers and kept the seat vacant.

The order in which they sat was Mikihiko, Mizuki, Honoka, vacant, Erika, Leo. They had left Miyuki’s seat in the middle because if they were not on guard some unknown shady character might approach from either side. At first Erika had been reluctant to sit next to Leo, but at Mizuki’s subtle argument that Leo and Honoka were not only in different classes but hardly knew each other, she had been finally persuaded. That incident almost but not quite resembled the nowadays rare event called a catfight.

Before Miyuki had come, the four excluding Honoka had been looking over the schedule of the Newcomer’s Battle, and were holding a pamphlet intended for the audience (Honoka was a contestant so she had no need to recheck at this point).

After looking up to greet Miyuki, Mizuki returned to looking at the pamphlet, but not before noticing Honoka’s faint expression.

“……Honoka-san, are you prepared?”

“It’s fine. My race is in the afternoon.”

Honoka answered Mizuki with a slightly forced smile.

Miyuki replied to that in an incredulous tone.

“Ho-no-ka. If you’re this nervous before the match, you’ll be in big trouble later you know?”

“Uu, I know but……”

“You’ll be fine, Honoka. Onii-sama said so as well didn’t he?”

“Ye, yeah……”

“You came to see this to take your mind off your race didn’t you? For now, let’s cheer Shizuku on.”

“……yeah, you’re right.”

From her rather exaggerated nod, it was evident she wasn’t totally relaxed. That serious-to-a-fault way of thinking was a strong point of her personality, so you could almost say it was unavoidable tension.

“……um, did I say something unnecessary?”

At Mizuki’s follow-up, devoid of malice, Honoka simply lowered her face.




A bit away from those 1st Years, or rather their boisterous play, the 3rd Year trio Student Council and Public Morals Committee chiefs were gathered.

“Mari, is it alright for you not to sleep?”

“I’m not sick. As long as I don’t have to fight I’ll be fine. More than that, Mayumi, is it alright for you to be away from your duties?”

“It’s fine. It’s not like I’m kilometers away, and if anything comes up I can be informed instantly.”

Saying so, Mayumi brushed away the hair hanging over her cheek.

That act revealed the receiver in her ear for voice communications.

“Still, if it were just Mayumi it would be business as usual, but for Ichihara to be away as well makes me wonder.”

“No problem. It seems I’ve been forced off duty today.”

“……your jokes are hard to understand as ever, Ichihara.”

At that tongue in cheek answer, Mari was suspicious for a moment if there was any dissatisfaction at that supplanting of their staff role.

Of course, she knew full well that wasn’t the case.

Suzune bore overall responsibility for the operations staff (although there are only four people in that capacity), but individual strategic planning followed division of labor. The greatest responsibility was divided, with male staff going over strategies for the men’s matches and female staff going over strategies for the women’s matches.

Today’s competition was the women’s Speed Shooting contest, under the charge of Suzune.

—But, this was an event which didn’t allow for fine strategies in the first place, being largely dependent on technical ability. It wouldn’t be far off the mark to even say brute force. Any staff involvement would merely detail the selection of magic to match the characteristics of the competitor, and the setting of the CAD to suit, but…

…this was a region which overlapped the work of the technical staff.

Furthermore for the 1st Year women’s Speed Shooting, the CAD magic selection, settings and all, Tatsuya handled everything from planning to execution.

That being said, Suzune had been aware of the plan and approved it from the start.

She wasn’t the type to be put on the back foot by something of this level.

“Now then…… come to think of it, this will be the first time I see something he’s engineered used in a combat capacity.”

At Mari’s words brimming with curiosity, Mayumi also looked over at the arena with interest.

“That’s true. During my time, he was a great help. I’m looking forward to seeing how a CAD he’s adjusted from the start will perform.”

“Starting with Kitayama-san, it seems he’s become very popular with the team.”

Suzune’s words held no exaggeration.

Initially amongst First High’s 1st Year women’s team, with the exception of Miyuki, Honoka and Shizuku, Tatsuya being in the same year, and furthermore a Course 2 student, seemed to provoke an almost allergic reaction from the other members when it came to giving him their CAD for adjustment.

But after a few practices with the CADs he calibrated, any such negative feelings completely vanished.

Perhaps it’d be more suitable to call that change of heart “being blown away”.

“It seems that today there are also a few contestants who have brought their own CADs.”

At Suzune’s words, Mari made a sound of surprise.

“Hey hey…… wouldn’t that cause problems in the match?”

“That’s just another sign of Shiba-kun’s amazing control. It seems he’ll service them after the match is over.”

Service refers to the adjustment of the CAD.

The contestants using Tatsuya’s competition adjusted CADs were even bringing him their personal CADs to adjust. Furthermore, rather than just one or two, it was more like the entire female 1st Year team.

“His fans seem to be steadily increasing.”

“The good natures of people come out in the strangest of places.”

Both Mayumi and Mari, exchanging a glance, shared a small chuckle.




If Tatsuya himself had been faced with Mayumi’s remark “his fans are increasing”, he would have vehemently denied it.

In fact, during social events, he went out of his way to avoid women (or so he felt).

Needless to say however, he didn’t possess any such “divine ears”.

His attention was focused solely on the shooting range Shizuku now stood at.

He did not possess “eyes” like Mizuki.

He did however have the power to analyze data structures.

The data structures he himself had written and programmed into the CAD were all in his head.

If she put her hands even slightly together, while he could not perceive the “hand” he could predict the “result”.

Shizuku took her stance.

The lights on the start ramp began to light up.

(It seems this time it’s alright.)

There was no evidence of the tampering which had caused problems such as in Mari’s case, Tatsuya thought, yet he didn’t divert his “eye”.




The moment all the lights came on, a clay target flew into the air.

And the moment it entered the scoring area, it was blown apart.

The next target was shattered in the middle of the area.

Next, two were simultaneously destroyed at either end.

A sigh rose from the audience. If one looked closely, Miyuki and the others were also sighing in relief at this brilliantly smooth start, letting out the breath they had been holding.

Shizuku’s eyes didn’t deviate for a second.

She simply gazed straight ahead, almost as if not looking at the targets.

“Uwah, amazing!”

In contrast to Erika’s simple admiration,

“……is the Magic Activation Zone set for the entire area?”

Mizuki asked Miyuki and Honoka rather doubtfully.

“That’s correct. Shizuku is able to tag all solids that enter the area with magic vibratory waves, destroying the target. By generating compression waves inside the target, it undergoes repeated partial expansion and contraction. If this rapid heating and cooling is repeated, it’s only logical that even solid rock would weaken and collapse.”

“To be precise, she sets numerous epicenters within the scoring area, which generate the virtual waves that give rise to the vibratory waves within the targets. Rather than directly applying the waves to the targets with magic, she has set up an area which causes the phenomena of applying such waves to the targets. The moment the waves from the epicenter come into contact with such a target, the virtual waves become real waves within the target and affect it in reality.”

As Honoka and Miyuki carried out their polite commentary whilst their eyes remained fixed on the shooting range, Mizuki simply nodded.




“……is the mechanism involved.”

Whether by chance or necessity, the 3rd Year trio was also having the same conversation at the same time.

“As you know, the effective scoring area in Speed Shooting is a cube of 15 meter proportions set in the air. Shiba-kun’s Activation Sequence sets another cube within this which is 10 meters on each side, with the vertices and the center, nine points in total, being designated as epicenters.”

The one who had first made that explanation was Tatsuya. Suzune had been shown the plan.

“Each point is labeled with a number, and when that number is entered into the live Activation Sequence, virtual waves spread from that point.

The reach of the waves is six meters. In other words the moment the magic is activated, all targets within a six meter radius from the epicenter will be destroyed.”

“……it rather feels like it’s using unnecessary force…… is Kitayama alright with those settings?”

“Although it has to be said that Kitayama-san is better known for her power than her precision……”

At Mari’s pause, Suzune was wearing her typical cool poker face. But within her eyes, the shadow of a sympathetic laugh could be found.

“The aim of this magic is not to compensate for accuracy, but rather to increase speed at the expense of accuracy.”

“……In other words, you’re implying that a more pinpoint aiming solution is possible right? Please elaborate?”

“The feature of this magic is that it is coordinated by numbers.”

Returning her gaze to the 1st Year before them, Suzune began her explanation to Mayumi’s question. Her fluent reply was probably because she had gotten an answer after earlier asking the exact same thing.

“In Speed Shooting, the position of the contestants and the distance, direction and size of the scoring area is always the same. In other words the focal points necessary in this magic to set the virtual cube in relation to the distance, and viewing angle of the player, are constants.

Therefore there is no need to enter variable coordinates separately each time, but instead you can simply input into the Activation Sequence the number you desire and instantly invoke the magic. For this rough degree of aim, using the auxiliary aiming systems built into the CAD, it’s possible for the optimal point to be automatically picked out.

Furthermore, this magic doesn’t require changes in duration or power either. There isn’t any need. In truth, they’re treated as constants by the Activation Sequence. The contestant, just by selecting a point with the aid of the CAD without needing to think of any other variables, can simply pull the virtual trigger and end up destroying the target.”

The shoot was approaching the end.

Not a single target had been missed.

“Since there’s no need to physically interface with the controls, merely invoking the magic will fully realize the potential of effect. I do believe the continuous Activation utilizes Multicast as well.”

The shoot drew to a close.

Final result, perfect.

“The proper name of the magic is ‘Active Air Mine’. It seems to be a Shiba-kun original. Well, all the numerous elements jammed in make the final Activation Sequence quite a beast, but Kitayama-san’s formidable magic power makes up for it.”

“……it’s pretty much the exact opposite of Mayumi’s magic isn’t it?”

“……coming up with a sequence like this is quite something.”

Mayumi’s voice held not so much admiration as outright amazement.

“Still…… it’s rather intriguing.”

On the other hand, Mari’s voice was filled with interest.

“In battle the relative position between you and your opponents will by no means remain the same, so from the view of marksman magic it’s not quite combat worthy, but…… if instead of setting the cube in the air, you center it as a sphere around yourself, wouldn’t it serve very admirably in all directions as an active shield?”

“The problem is activation duration. If you set it too short the timing will be difficult, but too long and you risk yourself being caught in the area of effect.”

Despite these issues presented by Mayumi, Mari’s enthusiasm didn’t dampen in the slightest.

“That will be up to the operator’s skill. As you said, if you’re able to gauge the timing you can set the duration to be short no problem. ……alright, immediately after this I’m going to nab him and install it by tonight.”

“……try not to cause any problems for the competitors.”

Mayumi’s voice as she responded was now 100% amazement.




“Good work.”

As Shizuku returned from the shooting range, Tatsuya offered up words of praise along with a towel. The engineer isn’t the manager so there’s no need for him to have a towel handy, but he wasn’t one to fall for such petty pride.

“It was somewhat anticlimactic.”

She wasn’t blustering in any way — it seemed she really felt so.

Whilst wiping the sweat from her brow, Shizuku had a slightly dissatisfied look.

Still at the same time, her joy was plain to see (it wasn’t like she was trying to hide it or anything anyway.)

The qualifying score needed for the Newcomer’s Battle was around 80% each year.

Because it was impossible to score any higher than what she had gotten, regardless of the borderline she would obviously advance to the finals.

“I don’t think anything went through the blind spots, as expected; they didn’t try such obstinate unsporting things.”

The magic Shizuku had used did not cover the entire scoring area. The area around the outer edges could be considered blind spots.

However, as seen from the performance of the machine launching the clay targets, there were no last minute changes to the trajectory of the targets. If a target had not passed right through the scoring area, the entire shoot would have to be redone out of issues of fairness, a blunder on the part of the tournament committee. Due to the nature of the competition, that was a risk they didn’t need.

They had made a strategy covering even that eventuality so it wasn’t particularly a big concern, but not having to rely on that backup was something to be relieved about after all.

“Tatsuya-san, you worry too much. To try for that they’d have to deliberately probe for the blind spots, something too high level for the Newcomer’s Battle.”

Shizuku’s words were only right.

Tatsuya put such things out of his mind, and switched to Shizuku’s perspective.

“At first we’ll go according to plan. But from the quarterfinals on will be match format. I’ll service your CAD in the morning, so be sure to let me take a look.”

“Got it.”

The format between the qualifier and finals is different. The qualifier is to see how many of the 100 clay targets you can destroy in five minutes, a test of the speed and reliability of your magic. In the finals however, it’s a test to see which player can destroy the most targets being fired into the same area. The factors of speed and reliability are joined by raw power and the ability to overcome interference from your opponents. As per the nature of this competition, the magic you normally use will also change accordingly.

Depending on the type of magic to be used, it’s not uncommon to change the specialized CADs used for the competition themselves.

Tatsuya was now making preparations for the next contestants — for the next match that would follow, and the one after that.

Shizuku went alone to the storage tent to fetch the CADs used for the tournament finals.




“All three of them qualified huh……”

Back in the tent which served as the headquarters of First High, Mayumi went over the results of the Speed Shooting preliminaries.

Whilst looking, Mayumi gave a small soliloquy.

“Maybe the 1st Year girls this year are just of a special level?”

Eight names had qualified for the finals from a preliminary of twenty four.

Three of those eight names were from the same school, having made it through to the finals of the Newcomer’s Battle, an unprecedented number.

“Mari, won’t you give up your pretense?”

Mayumi’s remarks were normally followed by a tsukkomi by Mari, but this time she simply shrugged in silence.

Her pose seemed to suggest futility.

“I wonder how the Battle Board will turn out.”

At Mayumi’s question, Suzune deliberately took out her terminal and checked. (“Deliberately” in the sense that she knew in her head already.)

“The men’s team missed the cut even after the second race, while the women’s qualified after the first.”

“The men are down to one last guy huh. On the girls’ side, Mitsui-san’s in the last race and is certain to make it through the prelims…… it seems A-chan has been working hard.”

As Mayumi muttered to herself,

“We may want to devote a bit more time to technical skills on our side as well.”

Looking over the same report card from his own terminal, Katsuto responded in disgust.




The quarterfinals of Speed Shooting took place on four shooting ranges.

If the eight who had advanced to the tournament proper were all from different schools the semis could have been resolved in four simultaneous games, but at the presence of competitors from the same school, the games had to be adjusted so as to not overlap (there is no competition between entrants of the same school during the semis.)

That being said, compared to conducting the semis one by one on a single range, the interval between each game was rather short. As three of First High’s women’s team had advanced to the semis, the engineers were kept very busy.

“……Tatsuya-san, is everything alright?”

Being last in turn, Shizuku reflexively spoke up when Tatsuya rushed in as she sat in the waiting room (although since she was in a tent, it couldn’t strictly be called a “room”).

Maybe it was a trick of the mind, but it seemed to her that he was also slightly out of breath.

“It’s fine.”

With that short answer, Tatsuya began a final check of the CAD.

As Shizuku looked on — or rather stared — he rapidly scrolled through the monitor of the adjustment device ensuring there were no abnormalities, before finally meeting Shizuku’s eye.

“I think you already know, but this is a totally different model from the ones used in the preliminaries. There’s almost no time now, but if there’s even the slightest discomfort, I’ll re-adjust it as much as possible so please feel free to tell me anything.”

Taking the CAD from Tatsuya, Shizuku took a stance and after repeatedly pulling the trigger with her finger two, three times, she put the CAD down.

“There’s nothing of the sort. Rather, it fits so well it’s almost frightening.”

“I see.”





She didn’t thump her chest or anything, but at Tatsuya’s relieved look, Shizuku’s expression filled with fighting spirit.

“The other two won didn’t they?”

“Yeah.”

The other two, referred to her teammates who had already gone.

Those two, who had along with Shizuku advanced to the finals tournament, seemed to have clinched a win in the semi finals as well.

“It’s fine.”

Once again, Tatsuya used the same words, but with a different meaning.

“If Shizuku performs as usual, you’ll definitely win.”

“Of course.”

At that, Shizuku gave a brief yet far more vigorous than usual nod.

“Tatsuya-san has already made all the arrangements I need for victory, so all that’s left is for me to take it.”

“That’s the spirit.”

Without challenging her early declaration of success, Tatsuya saw her off with a smile.




“It’s finally Shizuku-san’s turn.”

“Hey hey, if even Mizuki is nervous how should I cope?”

“But aren’t you all excited as well Erika-chan? If Shizuku-san wins here, three of the final best four will be from our school!”

“Aren’t you a bit too nervous regardless? Shizuku is definitely going to win after all.”

At that confident affirmation, mingled with a teasing remark from Miyuki to “take a deep breath and calm down”, Mizuki obediently cleared her mind and inhaled.

“……I wonder if this also counts as a sort of promise.”

“……I guess even Mizuki-san can be playful at times.”

Rather than as a result of the deep breathing, but more from not wanting to cause Miyuki and Honoka any more worry, Mizuki finally regained her composure.

“I wonder what kind of twist we’ll see this time.”

Hearing Mikihiko’s voice bearing a hint of excitement, Erika made a “huh?” expression.

“Good point. What will jump out this time, I can’t even begin to guess.”

The one who actually responded aloud was Leo.

“His mind is almost like a jack-in-the-box.”

“You can talk.”

For Mikihiko to look forward to and show interest in magic was something Erika hadn’t seen for a long time.

Whether this change had been brought about simply by watching the competition with others, she couldn’t say. Perhaps without her knowing, something had happened between Tatsuya and Mikihiko…… without voicing anything aloud, Erika pondered such things.

“Eh? That’s……”

Breaking her out of her train of thought and back to reality was a querulous voice.

“What is it?”

“That CAD……?”

Mikihiko’s gaze was fixed on the CAD Shizuku held under her arm by a strap.

That rifle shaped CAD at first glance, with the exception of the strap, was no different from the CAD the other contestants were using. But the area of the gun where ammunition would normally be stored was thicker than the others.

Mikihiko’s school traditionally didn’t place much emphasis on CADs. They still mainly utilized magic activated by charms. But ever since the accident last year, Mikihiko had obsessively been studying up on modern magic technology.

To compensate for what he had lost.

The result of that had been evident in his test results.

Mikihiko had considerably more confidence in CADs than comparable modern mages.

If his eyes weren’t mistaken.

“Is that…… a general purpose CAD?”

“Eh, you’re kidding?”

“Yeah, well, it is.”

“I’ve never heard of a general CAD shaped like a rifle before. Firstly, isn’t combining auxiliary sighting systems into a general system technically impossible?”

It was only natural that Leo, Mizuki, and Erika would ask one question after another.

But Mikihiko simply shook his head with confidence.

“The arrangement of the body portion just above the trigger of the CAD is without a doubt FLT’s general purpose ‘Centaur’ series. The Centaur series is a type which doesn’t have any interfaces on the main body and can be used without any external input devices, but the connector has had a grip and auxiliary aim assist system attached.”

“You really know your stuff.”

Miyuki’s words as she turned around and grinned confirmed Mikihiko’s observations.

“Eh? Then, that is?”

“You’re right Erika. That’s specially handcrafted by Onii-sama. It was specifically made to incorporate auxiliary aiming systems into a general purpose CAD.”

At Miyuki’s proud words, the knowledge that the CAD was a special made-to-order model, Erika was rendered speechless at the amount of effort that must have taken.

“I don’t think I could feel any more surprised but…… just what is it all for?”

“Of course, for the match.”

Honoka’s brief answer was not near enough to satisfy Leo’s, and the other three’s questions.

But no subsequent explanation followed through.

As if by common consent, the six of them faced forwards. The signal for the start of the match began to light up.




Red and white clay targets danced in the sky.

Shizuku’s targets were the red ones.

The three red targets that twisted through the air and entered the scoring zone, flew together towards the center and shattered.

“Movement system…… no, that’s wrong. Convergence system?”

In the tent used by each school as a headquarters, large monitors covering every aspect of the competitions gave full view of the matches underway.

Both Suzune and Mayumi were watching Shizuku’s match on the monitor with their full attention.

“Correct.”

This time, all red targets which entered the scoring area were being drawn into the middle and destroyed.

“That’s the magic used in the qualifiers isn’t it?”

“Yes. It’s a continuous invocation of convergence magic and vibration magic.”

Two of the white targets collided and broke apart.

The opponent from Second High was using an orthodox tactic of targeting the clay itself using movement magic, and turning it into a bullet to hit other targets.

Although orthodox, its effectiveness had been amply demonstrated by past performances.

But from the outset, the majority of the targets being removed from around the outer area were white.

Since most of those had been hit around the outer edge, the problem lay not in the technical ability of the contestant but rather…

“I get that the area of effect is able to recognize the targets on a macro level and enhance the density of red targets in the center via convergence, whilst displacing the white targets from that center but……”

The basic form of Convergence Magic works by defining existing space via the Magic Ritual, then taking that defined “data” and selectively manipulating it via designated coordinates using that same Magic Ritual.

For example, Mayumi’s magic which utilizes dry ice to make bullets and send them flying, in order to create a sufficient number of bullets, initially also uses Convergence Magic to gather carbon dioxide.

In this case, carbon dioxide is collected in one place while other gases are pushed aside, but this does not mean a high density mass of carbon dioxide is made, as the CO2 rather flows through designated coordinates whilst other gases are drawn out.

In the same manner, Shizuku’s magic replaced carbon dioxide with red targets.

A special zone — in this case, the center of the scoring area — was set up as a “space where red targets are gathered” by that Systematic Convergence Magic.

More specifically a square space 20 meters per side, comfortably covering the entire scoring area and more, was magically altered to become a “space with a high density of red clay targets in the center.”

The volume of that area is huge, but as the total number of clay targets at any one time is small, there isn’t a large burden on the operator. What is modified isn’t the space itself, but rather the distribution of clay targets within that space.

The modification of data via the Magic Ritual results in red targets being drawn to the center of the area, while white targets are repelled. The targets the Second High contestant directly controlled weren’t affected by such minor interference, but the targets the Second High student tried to hit, due to not receiving any magic from her, had their trajectories changed by Shizuku’s magic and as a result, white targets began to be missed.

The rules of the Speed Shooting tournament finals state that as long as you do not directly attack your opponent, interference is allowed. But as the clay targets fly for only short irregular periods, it’s very hard to block your opponent and shoot your own targets at the same time. There were many cases when vacillating between sniping and interfering resulted in self destruction, but as Shizuku’s Systematic Convergence Magic flawlessly linked disturbing the opponent and destroying one’s own targets, it was a very skillful strategy.

While few, there are some examples of this strategy being used in the past, all of which shared one effect. As strong interference strength is needed, the strategy involves the selection of an appropriate contestant. Therefore while the window of opportunity is small, Mayumi had also firmly studied this tactic.

So what Mayumi was asking concerning this magic was not that in itself.

“But then, how is she able to turn on and off the Systematic Vibration Magic at the end?”

If multiple targets flew together, they would shatter as is.

If a red target was alone however, vibration magic was used to destroy it.

It had been configured as a single magic, so for her to be able to independently trigger the Systematic Vibration Magic to destroy targets was peculiar.

“I wonder if it’s been scheduled that multiple targets would fly together before the Vibration Magic has a chance to trigger?”

Mayumi’s tone as she reasoned to herself said that not even she believed it.

There’s no merit to applying such a time difference.

“Pres, I did say it was ‘continuous invocation of Systematic Convergence Magic and Systematic Vibration Magic’ didn’t I?”

With a sly smile, Suzune corrected Mayumi’s misunderstanding.

Mayumi immediately understood the meaning of those words.

And upon reflection, immediately cried a rebuttal.

“No way! The systems in a specialized CAD should only be able to store one single Activation Sequence!?”

“Your doubts are well founded, except that’s not a specialized CAD, but a general one.”

Suzune’s answer only brought Mayumi still more confusion.

“That’s impossible! The hardware, OS and architecture between specialized and general CADs are totally different.

And auxiliary aiming devices are subsystems which only fit within the architecture of a specialized CAD.

Connecting an auxiliary aiming device to the body of a general CAD is technically impossible isn’t it?”

Mayumi’s stressful speech gradually settled down, but from the blush of her cheeks it was still possible to glimpse her raw excitement.

Suzune’s smile, now calm and mature, turned into something to soothe her companion.

“I thought so too. But, I guess it really is possible. This isn’t something original to Shiba-kun, but was announced in Germany a year ago.”

“……one year ago, isn’t that pretty much state of the art?”

“It’s best if you’re not surprised simply by this much, Pres. He’s being real coy about it, but Shiba-kun has something even more cutting edge in store.”

“Hahh…… Well, if it’s confidential it can’t be helped. But for him to tell Rin-chan about it and not me is a bit of a shock.”

“The Pres is a contestant. I’m sure he simply didn’t want to upset you.”

“I guess…… if I had known about a technique like this in advance, I certainly might have become a bit agitated.”

As their eyes returned to the monitor, the scores of both players and the remaining time were displayed onscreen.

With the clock ticking down, victory had already been decided.




(30 seconds remaining)

Having been repeatedly training these past two weeks, practicing over and over, she was now able to measure exactly the flow of the 5 minutes of the competition.

The moment red clay flew into the blue sphere projected by her goggles, Shizuku triggered her CAD.

The target shattered.

The competition allows the use of the protective goggles to double as a sighting aid. In fact, the number of competitors who don’t do so are rare. (The case of players like Mayumi who have their own sights aside.) However, rather than aiming directly at the target, Shizuku’s functioned as a HMD (head mount display) in order to distinguish space. Or rather, it should be called Tatsuya’s.

As with all the unorthodox techniques Tatsuya had proposed, Shizuku had also been puzzled with this at first. However, possibly because she had no actual competition experience, she fortunately didn’t take any time to get used to it. Once she was comfortable, it matched her more perfectly than any other equipment or techniques than she would have believed.

Anyway, it was easy.

There was almost no stress associated with the normal use of magic.

Shizuku herself was aware that her weakness was fine control.

That was why she had requested her CAD engineers to add features that assist in the smoothing of detailed settings.

Even at the expense of speed, her aim was to ensure that her CAD would be able to output power at a reliable level.

She was confident her own ability could compensate for the speed of processing.

However Tatsuya’s Sequences made detailed settings unnecessary.

Rather than making up for her shortcomings, the concept was to maximize her advantages.

The intent capitalized on her processing power to continuously trigger a Sequence at high speeds, and her capacity to build large Magic Rituals.

The result was the CAD she now held in her hand.

She had been surprised at him being able to connect an auxiliary aiming system to a general type CAD, but she had been even more surprised at the Activation Sequence speed.

In terms of processing speed, general CADs lose out to specialized ones.

This was not so much common sense, but rather a matter of structure.

General and specialized CADs differ both in their hardware and software.

The difference between them, between a dedicated processor and general processor, is similar to the difference between a dedicated supercomputer and a general one.

Comparing CPU performance in terms of speed, a generic type will never be the equal of a specialized type. This difference in level can usually be felt clearly.

And yet — this CAD demonstrated speed no less to that of a specialized CAD.

(5 more seconds)

—A target came flying.

—She pulled the trigger.

—Magic activated.

—And the target shattered.

This processing speed, even when compared with the specialized CAD used during the preliminaries, showed almost no difference.

Tatsuya had said the trick was because “it was limited to only two Sequences”.

Since it had been designed exclusively for the competition, he was able to use a trick that would not be viable for daily use.

Shizuku could not understand the detailed theory.

She didn’t think it necessary.

Magic was a tool.

The CAD was also a tool.

A tool just needs to be usable.

Any more than that, could be left to the experts.

The last two targets weren’t shattered by the “Air Mine”, but by Loop Cast Convergence magic.

“Perfect.”

Confirming her performance aloud, Shizuku gave a smile of triumph.




Noon.

Inside First High School’s tent, a jubilant atmosphere filled the air.

“That was brilliant, Tatsuya-kun! What an amazing achievement!”

Having been patted and slapped on the back countless times, Tatsuya was growing tired. Just as Mayumi’s slender figure suggested there was no actual pain involved, but her persistence was certainly wearying.

“……Pres, please calm down a little.”

Making eye contact with Suzune in a plea for assistance, she immediately began to remonstrate with Mayumi.

Quite the dependable senpai — if not for the fact that she had gone along until being asked for help, making her feel rather more like a “partner in crime”.

“Ah, I’m sorry.”

Perhaps having too much fun and finally coming to her senses, Mayumi immediately stopped the slapping. ……but it didn’t seem like she intended to let him go anytime soon.

“Still, that was truly astounding! We took all first, second and third places!”

“……the winner, runner-up and third place are all contestants, not me.”

“Of course Kitayama-san, Akechi-san, and Takigawa-san were also amazing! Everyone did so well!”

At the Student Council President’s broad smile, the 1st Year women’s Speed Shooting team bowed in unison with a happy “thank you”.

“But at the same time, your own achievements are no less. They were without a doubt spectacular.”

Although without Mayumi’s sheer energy, Mari also joined in the praise with a good natured face.

“Uh, thank you very much.”

“It’s not like this is a contest. As the engineer who significantly contributed to our contestants’ monopoly of all the placings, you should have your share of the recognition.”

At Mari’s words, Shizuku and the others nodded deeply.

“I couldn’t believe it myself.”

“My magic suddenly became so good, it was like an illusion.”

Unlike Shizuku, the other two added their own comments.

Shizuku simply nodded as if everything was a matter of course.

“Especially concerning the magic Kitayama-san used, there has been an approach from the Universities to officially adopt it into the ‘Index’.”

However, at Suzune’s words Mayumi’s eyes widened, Mari was lost for words and Shizuku stiffened.

The official name of the Index is the “National Magic University Compiled・Magic Encyclopedia・Index of True Names”.

For a magic to have its proper name recorded in the encyclopedia the National Magic Universities are creating, in this context, means the magic would not be considered a subset of any existing magic, but officially recognized by the Universities as an entirely new branch of magic.

To researchers engaged in the development of magic in Japan, this was the one single honor they all strove for.

However—

“I see. Then, please submit Kitayama-san as the developer’s name.”

“What!? No way!”

At Tatsuya’s utter lack of interest, Shizuku drew close in a hurry.

“That was Tatsuya-san’s original magic!”

“……It’s normal for the developer name of a new magic to be registered as the name of the first user is it not?”

Distancing himself from Shizuku’s pleas, Tatsuya replied with no tension.

“Hm……excessive humility is also unpleasant you know?”

At Mari’s chiding, accompanied by a slightly chilling glance, Tatsuya simply shook his head reluctantly.

“It’s not humility.”

“Then what is it?”

“I just don’t want the shame of having my name registered as the developer of a magic I can’t even use.”

Certainly, if one is known as the developer of a new type of magic, they are often asked for demonstrations.

If one is “unable to use” a magic they developed themselves, suspicions would arise that maybe the magic was actually developed by others.

Tatsuya’s reason was not unjustifiable, but……

“……Just how then did you manage to confirm the operative readiness of a magic you can’t use?”

Building up a magic by theory alone is surpassingly non-standard but, even if it were possible, to let another use a magic that was not tested and verified as functional was the work of a mad scientist who ignored all the risks, and it was extremely immoral.

“It’s not like I can’t use it at all. It’s just that it would take me far too much time to set up, to the point it’s not really at the level you could say I can truly ‘use’ it.”

“Well well, Mari, Tatsuya-kun, let’s not quarrel over such a thing now.”

Seeing Mari preparing more ammunition to throw at Tatsuya’s comeback, Mayumi intervened between the two.

“We’re finally back to a good start. Tatsuya-kun, please help the other competitors just as much.”

As Mayumi tapped his shoulder with a smile, Tatsuya gave a modest bow.




The performance of First High School’s women’s Speed Shooting team had created a stir in the other schools.

There was an enthusiastic feeling of “we can win this year” throughout the Nine Schools Tournament, especially Third High School, who thought of the accident in the women’s Battle Board “we feel bad for them, but this is a chance!” — While such thoughts may seem excessive, they were shared amongst the others.

“So Masaki, First High’s performance, you don’t think it was due to the personal skill of those girls themselves?”

Of the twenty people gathered — all the 1st Years of the Third High School Newcomer’s Battle contestants —

“It has to be said, the magical power of the winner, that Kitayama girl, is astounding. I’m sure she would have won either way. But the other two, I don’t feel were anything special. If the results had been decided by magical power alone, I’m sure they wouldn’t have gone so far as to claim second and third place as well.”

“Not to mention that the advantage in Battle Board lies with us this year, seeing how I think First High only has one 1st Year in it with a particularly high level.”

The results of the Battle Board so far had seen the two guys from Third High School both qualify, and of the two girls they sent forth one had qualified. By contrast only one of the men from the three First High School sent qualified, and the one girl they sent qualified too.

“It’s as George says. We don’t lose out in terms of the quality of our contestants. If that’s so, there must be some other factor.”

“Ichijou-kun, Kichijouji-kun……what do you think it is?”

At the question from the girl who had lost to First High in the semifinals of the Speed Shooting, both Ichijou and Kichijouji made eye contact, confirming their suspicions.

“It’s probably, their engineer.”

Kichijouji responded out loud.

“The engineer for their women’s Speed Shooting team is probably quite the ace.”

“I concur. George, the device that winner girl used……did you notice?”

“Yeah……that was a general purpose wasn’t it.”

Kichijouji’s answer, aside from the two of them, made a considerable impact on the other Third High 1st Years.

“No way……I mean, it had auxiliary sights attached right?”

“That’s right! I’ve never heard of a general purpose device shaped like a rifle either!”

“That’s true. Whichever maker’s catalogue you look through, you’d never find anything like that would you?”

At the objections being raised, Ichijou remained somber.

“……certainly, something like that has never commercially appeared. However, examples of general devices with integrated sighting aids do indeed exist.”

“You gotta be kidding……”

At Ichijou’s words, stunned voices floated through the air.

In fact a strong air of disbelief permeated throughout, until Kichijouji came out with his own support.

“It’s new technology, only just announced in Dusseldorf last summer.”

“Just last summer!? That’s freakin’ state of the art!”

“Yeah, I didn’t know either until I looked into it for this thing.”

“Not even Ichijou knew, there’s no way we would……”

An uncomfortable silence followed. Surprise, anxiety, doubt……and awe.

“……Kichijouji-kun sure knows a lot though. As expected of our brain.”

The words of that female competitor were intended to loosen up the heavy atmosphere.

But Kichijouji remained unmoved.

“Sure……but, the prototype unveiled in Dusseldorf was not meant to be a practical model. The operation was sluggish, accuracy was low — from a technical standpoint it was simply an experiment that had been cast aside.”

Kichijouji knotted his brow as he replied, his voice bitter.

“The device the winner First High’s Kitayama-san used however fully combined the strengths of the speed and accuracy of a specialized type with the versatility of a general type. If that was all the work of one engineer……that’s not the level of a high school student anymore. It’s almost monstrous.”

“Masaki, for you to describe someone that far……”

“It’s physically impossible for a single engineer to be responsible for every competitor though……”

“Competitions that guy is responsible for in the future are likely to be beastly. It’s very likely our devices will be handicapped by at least two or three generations.”

At Kichijouji’s ominous speculation, silence reigned amongst the gathered teammates.




Tatsuya, who was at this moment receiving such unjust treatment from the athletes in their rival schools without any knowledge (obviously) after finishing a late lunch proceeded to the girls’ Battle Board course.

Planned for the afternoon were the fourth to sixth races.

Honoka would appear in the sixth. If he only needed to keep his appointment with her, there should be no need to come so early.

“Ah, Shiba-kun, what’s the matter?”

At the sight of him accompanied by Miyuki and Shizuku, Azusa tilted her head. Her posture was so similar to a squirrel holding a nut that despite his melancholic mood, he couldn’t help but twitch a smile.

At his careless chuckle he consciously tried to tighten his lips, but there wasn’t enough tension. In resignation, he relaxed.

“……You were making fun of me just now weren’t you?”

“Not at all. I was just impressed by Nakajou-senpai’s diligence.”

“……You really are making fun of me aren’t you?”

Being glared at with those half-lidded eyes so much like a child sulking forced Tatsuya to look away to hold back his laughter.

“……It’s fine, I don’t care.”

Azusa kept glaring at him for a while, then with a sigh, muttered to herself.

This was probably something she went through every day.

Somehow, her figure also exuded an air of melancholy.

Leaving her like that would make one feel terrible.

“—I really wasn’t making fun of you.”

“……Really?”

“Really.”

“Really really?”

“Really.”

Being looked at with suspicion — due to the height difference, straight up — by Azusa, Tatsuya showed a strong front.

Seeing that proud bearing, Azusa finally seemed to relent (was she fooled?) and smiled.

“Alright. Because I believe in Tatsuya-kun.”

Saying so as she laughed at him, she drifted over to his side.

Tatsuya knew without even looking.

The image of Miyuki’s eyebrows rising floated into his mind.

(Ooh boy……)

It seemed his sister would be in a pretty bad mood tonight as well, he sighed to himself — although he couldn’t resent her for it, it did pain him a little inside.

—That aside.

“So, what’s the matter? There’s still two more hours before Mitsui-san’s match.”

“I felt rather uncomfortable outside, so I came here for some shelter.”

As Azusa tilted her head again, next to Tatsuya, Miyuki laughed.

“……Onii-sama is too concerned.”

At those questioning eyes, Miyuki’s tone suggested “it can’t be helped”.

“They’ve become very motivated, so I’m sure the end result will be just fine.”

On his other side, Shizuku reassured him.

“Ah, ahhh, is that what it is……”

Guessing the circumstances immediately, Azusa was pretty sharp too.

The monopoly of Shizuku and the others had been the subject of praise even throughout lunch.

Not just the executives, but the seniors who had the day off and had been watching that day went to compliment the three, yet the number of people who also went on to mention Tatsuya’s achievements were not inconsiderable.

At that, the men’s Speed Shooting team had begun burning with an extraordinary rivalry.

That in itself, as Shizuku said, was not undesirable.

If they become fired up and increase their desire for victory, as long as they aren’t idle, it works as a plus.

However, being stared at with eyes that seemed to burn with vengeance for their dead father, made you want to tell them to get a life.

Of course, to say such a thing out loud would lead to a fight. In order to avoid unnecessary trouble, he had come to the competition venue as early as possible.

The location of the Nine Schools Tournament was the southeast area of the Fuji Armed Forces Training Grounds. While it’s called an area, the Fuji training grounds were huge to begin with, and simply moving between venues would end up being a considerable hike. Without that much land, it would be impossible to prepare for areas such as the Battle Board course and the Monolith Code battlefield.

The Battle Board course was a winding flume circuit of approximately three kilometers.

With two sets for the two genders, as well as the spectator stands meant that quite a bit of land was needed just to make this course.

When considering moving around the venue, the Battle Board course had been constructed right at the edge of the area provided for the Nine Schools Tournament in order to avoid having to bypass that large course on the way to other venues, and it can safely be said that there were no competitors from other events around such as those participating in the concurrent men’s Speed Shooting.

“I could also have gone back to the dorm, but I decided since I’ll be coming here anyway I might as well see if there’s anything I could help with.”

“Really!?”

It wasn’t just Azusa who raised a cry.

Perhaps overhearing from somewhere, Honoka suddenly came flying out from the competitor’s area.

“Then please, by all means! Have a look at my CAD!”

Recently, under the influence of Tatsuya, Honoka had also began calling her device not “Assistance” but “CAD”. At Honoka’s momentous leap Tatsuya had almost laughed out loud again. Tightening his face against the impulse, he scolded Honoka.

“Hey, come on Honoka. That way of speaking is kinda rude to Nakajou-senpai you know?”

Honoka’s attitude, and her words just now, couldn’t help but be taken as some level of dissatisfaction at Azusa’s work.

“Eh, ah, I’m very sorry!”

Honoka lowered her head in a hurry.

“Don’t worry about it. I know you didn’t mean it in that way.”

Azusa shook her head with a dry smile.

Her tone was almost sisterly.

Resisting his urge to laugh this time was a difficult task.



The average time for a Battle Board round was about 15 minutes.

However, the loading and unloading of the boards as well as the inspection of the waterway, as well as the repair of areas damaged by magic meant more time was needed to prepare for each race.

Allowing for that, as well as extra time to give leeway, meant the competition schedule for Battle Board had been organized into blocks of one hour.

The final race would begin at 3:30 in the afternoon. Already, players were moving to the starting positions. The too long wait time was not good for tense nerves, and there were many instances of competitors ending up being unable to utilize their full strength (every year, such examples would occur for both genders in both the “real” finals and the Newcomers division), but possibly because of the chatter Honoka had shared with Miyuki and Shizuku before the match, she seemed in great condition as she stood poised upon her board.

The sight of Honoka constantly sticking to Tatsuya had gradually stirred up Miyuki’s mood, but instead of separating them she had gone along and entered into their chat, the result of which seemed to have been a positive diversion for Honoka.

The heavy swim shoes and thick wet suit that covered the wrists and ankles were meant to protect the competitor’s body from the friction of impacts and falling. But the pressurized uniform stuck fast to the wearer, and sharply emphasized the curves of the body even more than usual.

Over the thigh, in large letters, was the logo “ICHIKO”. With her stimulating proportions unbefitting a 1st Year highlighted by her colorful wet suit, Honoka crouched with one knee upon the board awaiting the start.

The CAD over her forearm was thinner and wider than usual, increasing its area and allowing for larger buttons. As he had said earlier, Tatsuya did not tamper with Honoka’s CAD.

After looking over the system, he found nothing which absolutely needed work.

Being asked for advice by both Honoka and Azusa, he had just one thing to offer.

The dark goggles that Honoka now wore had been brought by him.

To be sure, the midsummer sunshine was inclining in from the west to the extent that facing that way directly would be uncomfortably dazzling.

Due to water splashing on the glass and blocking their view, however, few competitors opted to use goggles or sunglasses.

Azusa had felt that narrowing the field of view would only be a disadvantage, but Honoka had taken the goggles without hesitation.

“……come to think of it, why has Mitsui-san prepared so many optical Activation Sequences?”

It’s rare for an engineer to issue Activation Sequences.

With the exception of Tatsuya, who plans out the Activation Sequence lineup himself, normally engineers install Sequences based on the wish of the competitors.

Azusa had known too that Honoka was adept with illusionary magic of the light wave system from her profile, but due to the nature of the competition, Azusa had honestly believed there was no place for illusionary magic.

“The rules of Battle Board state that interfering with other players via magic is prohibited. However, interfering with the water and thus indirectly interfering with other players is not.”

“……what does that mean?”

Despite being asked repeatedly by Azusa, Tatsuya had only returned an evil smile.

The signal for the start of the sixth qualifying race of the Newcomer’s women’s Battle Board came on.

Immediately after.

The audience in near unison turned away from the waterway. As if lit up by a flash, the water surface poured out light.

One competitor fell overboard.

The others had their balance disrupted whilst in the midst of accelerating, and one lone figure dashed to the front.

As if expecting the situation — although it has to be said that she was the one who created the situation — wearing dark goggles, that lone figure was Honoka.

“Alright.”

Looking up at Tatsuya, who gave a voice of affirmation, Azusa’s face was full of amazement.

“……Was this Onii-sama’s strategy?”

Miyuki’s voice as she removed her sunglasses was also filled with wonder. (By the way the sunglasses the three of them wore had been issued beforehand. Miyuki and the others had been mystified as to their purpose, but put them on anyway.)

“To be sure, it’s not prohibited by the rules but……”

Shizuku’s voice had a hint of reproach in it.

One couldn’t help feeling that this was rather against the spirit of fair play.

However the yellow flag which would indicate any significant unfair play remained unwaved, and the match continued. The red flag that signaled a player’s disqualification for rules violations likewise remained unused.

It meant that the tournament committee deemed Honoka’s magic, and Tatsuya’s strategy, a legal move.

“……Performing optical magic on the water’s surface, I didn’t expect that at all.”

Her personality straightforward at all times, Azusa muttered in admiration.

“Interfering with the water surface, whether to generate waves or vortexes, affects the consciousness and orientation of other competitors yet it is allowed since it complies with the rule that ‘you may affect another competitor via magically targeting the water surface’. Doing something like freezing the water solid or boiling it would certainly be too dangerous, but I did find it strange that no one until now had used it to cause dizziness.”

If one is suddenly blinded without any warning, it takes a while to restore vision.

Meandering slowly along the course, unable to sprint due to their obscured vision, the difference between Honoka and the other players was already decisive.




“……It’s in the bag.”

“……Who thought of this strategy?”

Mayumi who was watching through the monitor did not experience any discomfort as the monitor automatically adjusted the amount of light displayed, yet now while she was calmly assessing the originality of that tactic she remembered her initial surprise (although calm surprise is a bit of an oxymoron).

Following behind Mari’s mutter and Mayumi’s question, Suzune answered.

“It was Shiba-kun.”

“Eh, but I thought Tatsuya-kun wasn’t involved in this match?”

Hearing that answer, Mayumi tilted her head as if going “huh?”

Suzune’s reply was possibly a bit too polite.

“The one who submitted the plan in the first place was Mitsui-san. But the one who decided the Activation Sequence lineup and brushed up the finer details of the strategy was Shiba-kun, or so I’m told.”

Suzune’s deliberate mention of him “deciding the Activation Sequence lineup” was because of the perception that doing so was the exception, not the rule.

“……it really is one thing after another with him, isn’t it.”

A touch of reproach could be heard in Mari’s voice.

“What’s the matter? You seem somewhat dissatisfied.”

Mari didn’t answer Mayumi’s question.

However, her silence itself spoke volumes on what was on her mind,

“……Planning is very important. As the masters say.”

From what Mayumi could tell, Mari was cranky at being shown a tactic she hadn’t thought of. For Mari who prided herself on being a strategist, it decidedly wasn’t very fun.

“It’s a tactic no one has thought of for nine years, so this is the point where you should be nice and impressed.”

“……I am impressed. That’s why I’m so annoyed.”

Being cut into by Suzune, reluctantly, Mari admitted her jealousy.

Mari was magnanimous enough to accept it, so Suzune let her off for now.

“Still, this is a one-off strategy isn’t it? I wonder what he’ll do for the finals?”

Mari didn’t come up with a follow through, so Mayumi responded instead.

“No worries. There’s no way that man hasn’t thought that far ahead.”

“That’s true. This is also just a strategic move for the next match.”

Seems like it was a needless anxiety.




“Yeah……seems like I’ve done something bad to Honoka.”

Watching Honoka take the lead from her earlier move, and maintain it all the way until the finish, Tatsuya muttered in a bitter voice. Next to him, Miyuki looked up at her brother’s clouded face.

“……What’s the matter?”

Their appearance was noticed by others, and Azusa spoke up to Tatsuya.

“Ah, nothing……”

His answer was evasive, or in other words an excuse.

Still, he didn’t become silent.

“She could have won this race easily based on her speed alone……there was no need for the confusion.”

“Well……even so, she did take the lead thanks to her initial dazzle, so couldn’t you still call it a successful strategy?”

Azusa, not knowing the nature of Tatsuya’s regret, tilted her head.

“When you stand out so much, it’s going to mean you’ll be marked by the other contestants……”

“The semis are a race between three people……it’s a possibility that in the next match, the other two will pair up.”

Miyuki complemented Tatsuya’s words.

Finally, Azusa understood what they were worried about.

“Oh, is that what it was.”

And laughed at their concerns.

“Something like that……I’m pretty sure it’d be a disadvantage right?”

At Miyuki’s countering hesitance, Azusa merely shook her head happily.

“That won’t happen, since we’ve been marked from the start.”

“Haahh……”

She had said it so cheerfully that for a moment Tatsuya wondered if she was actually proud of that.

—Well, just for a moment.

However insensitive he was, he wasn’t so far gone as to not realize she was just comforting them.




“I won! I won, Tatsuya-san!”

As soon as she rose from the waterway, Honoka immediately hurried over to where Tatsuya and the others were without even changing from her wetsuit, hopping all the way.

“Ah, yeah. We saw. Well done.”

Aware of the other staff who had come down to greet their teammates, Tatsuya hastily put both hands out in front of him while congratulating her in an attempt to calm her down.

But it had the opposite effect.

“Thank you so much!”

Perhaps misunderstanding, Honoka clasped the hands Tatsuya held out and stared up at his face, tears of joy threatening to spill out from her eyes. Even Miyuki didn’t expect her to show her emotions so straightforwardly.

While Tatsuya stood frozen from a lack of experience with such things, Honoka really did start to cry.

“Whenever it comes to competitions, I become so weak……I hardly ever win competitions in athletic meets or tournaments like these.”

It was the first time he heard of this. If that were true, then maybe using the strategy in the Newcomer’s division wasn’t such a miscalculation after all.

But as Tatsuya stood helplessly looking left and right, behind Honoka the figure of Shizuku waving her hands flew into view.

From her appearance, it seemed she was saying “that’s not the case, not at all.”

With his hands still firmly grasped by Honoka, and establishing line of sight with Shizuku, she began to mouth words to him. Her lip movements read “she’s・talking・about・during・primary・school”.

(A story from their primary school days, huh……)

Tatsuya sighed whilst looking towards heaven.

She probably didn’t intend to lie or anything……but her conviction was just a little too intense.

Despite the icicle glare Miyuki directed at him (that is to say icy cold, and very sharp), he still required some time to regain his composure.




Both in athletics and on the board, if one does not have the will then victory will be uncertain.

It’s the same with magic competitions.

Looking at the success of one’s teammates and thinking “now it’s my turn” is a system which raises the willpower of the team, and is like a magic bullet which boosts morale.

“Willpower” is linked with “fighting spirit”, but “fighting spirit” also easily links to “futility”.

Before the girls’ eyes, such an event was occurring.

“Morisaki-kun was the runner-up, but……”

Mayumi’s words were wrapped in disappointment.

“The other two missed the cut huh……”

Mari’s words continued the disappointed trend.

At the close of the first day of the Newcomer’s Division, in the meeting room, the 3rd Year executives stood before the results of the men’s Speed Shooting rankings and let out a collective sigh.

“The results of the men’s and women’s are reversed……”

“I wouldn’t say that. Third High took first and fourth place, so the girls still give us a positive balance.

You’re being just a little too pessimistic.”

Suzune’s sober analysis countered Mayumi’s gloomy remarks. It was all in an effort to dispel the stagnant mood.

“……Right. As Ichihara said, it’s not good to be too negative. In the first place, the results of those girls are far more than we could have expected. We must be positive about the lead they have given us today.

“But the slump with the guys isn’t just in ‘quickdraw’. In ‘surfing’ as well, only one guy qualified compared to two girls.”

At Mari’s remarks, in a tone as if reminding herself, Katsuto agreed with a grim look. (By the way “quickdraw” is a nickname for Speed Shooting, as “surfing” is for Battle Board.)

“If their poor performance continues like this, even if we do well this year it’s possible we’ll be disadvantaged in the years to come.”

“That losing would become a habit?”

“It is a possibility.”

At Katsuto’s point, both Mari and Mayumi bitterly fell silent.

Being leaders of a Magic High School, especially the executives of First High who prided themselves upon victory, they were unable to live with the easy thought “we did good enough this year”.

“The mens’ side may require some support.”

“Still Juumonji, even if you say support what can we do at this late hour?”

Mari’s rebuttal to Katsuto’s murmur was bitter.

It was certainly a “late hour”.

The Newcomer’s Division had already begun. It wasn’t possible to change the staff or competitors anymore.

Even when she glanced at him, Katsuto had no reply.

That atmosphere however, rather than being at a loss, gave the impression not of mere silence but that a plan was forming.




At last tomorrow, or rather “today” already, was Miyuki’s turn.

There had been no move from the organized crime related sabotage warned of by Kazama since the incident involving Mari, but Tatsuya couldn’t put it out of his mind.

If his hypotheses were correct, the “enemy” had tampered with the CADs just prior to the competition. It was a low possibility for more sabotage to be carried out overnight, but it never hurt to double check.

For the enemy’s actions to be immediately undetectable by him, they held very high skill.

Finishing the final adjustments, he systematically tightly locked the CAD, then further added a triple lock before finally stopping work.

There isn’t a trace of any other person.

Not just humans, but no other life signs could be detected at all.

In regards to the enemy, it would be expected that security here is much higher.

Kazama and his subordinates, the elites of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion were secretly helping behind the scenes, so even if there was an attempt, a direct attack was unlikely to succeed.

Without wandering around unnecessarily, he proceeded through the entrance of the hotel (of course, requiring bio-metric identification), and went straight to his room.

Before he entered, he noticed at the door.

His only roommates were non-breathing machines.

At this time of night, when he was confident the minute hand of the clock should be announcing a date change any time now, there shouldn’t be any sign of life aside from him in the hallway — but he turned the key and walked inside regardless.

“Hey now, just what time do you think it is?”

Unlike usual, his slightly stern voice seized the initiative.

Unlike usual, his posture suggested this wasn’t something that could be let off with a smile.

Unlike usual, the one on the receiving end of all this must have realized that as well.

Her shoulders trembling, Miyuki hastily got up off the bed she had been sitting on, and fearfully looked up at her brother.

“A lack of sleep will reduce your ability to concentrate. Even if it’s you, where careless mistakes may not necessarily lead to defeat, that won’t always be the case.”

“I’m very sorry!”

Being scolded by Tatsuya in earnest, Miyuki bowed deeply in a voice verging on tears. Hearing his sister like this, seeing her like this, Tatsuya was simply unable to keep up his tough stance for any longer.

“……It’s good you understand. Now come on, let’s go back to your room. I’ll escort you there.”

Perhaps his voice was a little too forceful, as when Miyuki timidly looked up, she refused to look at her brother’s face.

“Miyuki?”

“……Onii-sama, for a bit, just a bit, could I have a little of your time?”

“……Just a little.”

A competition in obstinacy would be a waste of time.

Tatsuya knew from prior experience that his sister was rather passively aggressive in this way.

“I heard from Shizuku. Onii-sama, you turned down the honor of having your name added to the ‘Index’.”

“Not formally at least.”

“Rather than formally or anything, you were prohibited weren’t you?”

“Yeah.”

At Tatsuya’s brief affirmation, Miyuki, as if struggling with something, stood whilst biting her lip a while.

“……Was that, upon the orders of our Aunt?”

“Yeah.”

Another brief affirmation.

Miyuki, once again teary eyed, looked down.

“The investigative powers of the Magic Universities are very high. The gossip sites masquerading as news sites of normal media organizations can’t even begin to come close. They’re almost comparable to military or intelligence agencies.

Developers of new magic in addition to being given access to the resources of the Universities are also granted various privileges, but their identity is also examined in detail. It’s in order to root out national spies and terrorists. It’s an investigation on a totally different level to high school admission. It’s not unlikely they’ll discover not only my identity as ‘Silver’, but ‘Shiba Tatsuya’s’ identity as a Yotsuba which the Yotsuba themselves have been blocking so carefully.”

Faced with his sister’s tears, Tatsuya explained in a slightly cool voice.

It was not only because he had to be uncompromising in the face of her tears, but because he had to convince himself.

“……”

For a while, her head bowed, Miyuki said nothing.

Tatsuya felt relief at not hearing her sob anymore.

“To be sure, just entering the Nine Schools Competition carried some risk of my identity coming under scrutiny. However, leaving my name in the Magic Encyclopedia is far different from being in a high school competition. The ‘Guardian’ of the Yotsuba exists as a shadow. Do you think for such an outcast to be in the limelight would be acceptable to our Aunt?”

Miyuki kept silent. She didn’t even mouth any words of comfort.

That was her answer to his question.

“For now, I still don’t have enough power. In a head on situation, there is a possibility I could defeat the ‘Queen of Night’ Yotsuba Maya. My ‘Decomposition’ has good compatibility as a counter to her ‘Night’ after all.

But the me as of now, even if I could beat our Aunt, I can’t do anything about the Yotsuba. Force of arms alone, the threat of violence alone is not enough. If I displace our Aunt, another worse manipulator would simply show up in her place. At this moment, I can only follow.”

Those words weren’t so much to convince his sister, as for himself.

As he tried to satisfy himself that way,





Miyuki, moving from the front,

embraced him.

Her face shining with tears buried itself into his chest.

Such an appearance might be better described as “clinging”, yet that was somehow inappropriate.

“……I’m on your side.”

“Miyuki……”

“I will always no matter what, come what may, be on your side.

That time will definitely come. Without a doubt, it will come.

Until then, and forever after, I will always be on Onii-sama’s side.”

“……”

The hands of the clock accused them of far exceeding the realms of “just a little”.

But let’s go along with her “just a little more”…… Tatsuya thought as he gently wrapped his arms around Miyuki’s back.





Chapter 9




It was the fifth day of the Nine Schools Competition and the second morning of the Newcomers Division.

Tatsuya arrived in front of the arena that was busy preparing for the Newcomers Division’s Icicle Destruction.

Several large cranes were unloading 1 meter x 1 meter x 2 meter icicles from large battlefield vehicles specially modified for this purpose. Seeing this would naturally cause people to believe that the days where super robot anime became reality were not too far off.

“……If we could completely ignore energy efficiency, that is.”

“Onii-sama? What are you talking about?”

As if to reject this outrageous line of thinking, Tatsuya involuntarily started muttering to himself.

“No, it’s nothing.”

She did not pursue this vague answer.

“Let’s go quickly.”

“Yes.”

Originally, this was only a stopping point along their route to the competition location.

Tatsuya urged Miyuki onward towards the resting area located on the top floor of the Arrow Tower.




There was still 30 minutes until the start of the first round in the morning.

When Tatsuya entered the arena, there was still plenty of spare time.

“Good morning!”

……Still, the players for the first round were already there.

“Good morning…… Sorry for making you wait so long.”

“Oh please, I was the one who came too early.”

The player for the first round of Icicle Destruction, Akechi Eimi, smiled as she shook her head and swept a lock of her ruby red hair back from her face.

“Good morning, Eimi. How early did you get up?”

“Good morning, Miyuki. For some reason, I woke up before the alarm went off. It’s like I haven’t recovered from yesterday’s excitement.”

Her other name was Emilia Goldie. Her full name was Akechi Emilia Goldie Eimi. Eimi was a quarter British stock. Her nickname “Emmy”, rather than originating from her Japanese name “Eimi”, probably came from her British name “Emilia”.

A Magician’s ability was heavily influenced by genetics.

Due to the connection between magic and national power, each country jealously guarded its magic bloodlines and either officially or unofficially forbade international marriages between Magicians. (This country that superficially allowed freedom of marriage belonged in the “unofficial” category.)

Yet, in the generation of Tatsuya’s grandparents, allied countries actively encouraged international marriages between Magicians. The goal was to “cross” “excellent stock” to “develop” superior Magicians.

The ensuing result was that over half of the current students at magic high schools boasted bloodlines from Western Europe or India.

Leo was one of them, and the female student known as Akechi Eimi was another.

As could be inferred from her words, she also appeared in yesterday’s Speed Shooting competition. This was the second day in a row she was working alongside Tatsuya. Besides Miyuki and the two others, Eimi was the first one on the Women’s Team to jell with Tatsuya. For Tatsuya, she was also the most relaxed young lady on the team.

After the two of them exchanged greetings, they delved into girl talk as Tatsuya smoothly removed the CAD from the case he was carrying, performed a cursory examination, and handed it to Eimi.

This was a clumsy looking, shotgun-shaped Specialized CAD that measured 50 cm in length and completely dwarfed a young lady’s hand.

The weapon looked quite heavy, but because recoil wasn’t an issue, the weight was significantly lower than a normal firearm thanks to its lightweight materials. Yet Eimi’s movements were like something straight out of a Western as she swung the gun around and took aim out the window.

“……Eimi, you’re not British, but American, aren’t you?”

“How many times do I have to say this, no. Now even Miyuki is saying this too? My grandmother’s family was knighted by the Tudors themselves.”

Contrary to the content of her words, her tone remained unperturbed.

She maintained her current posture and started to supply the CAD with psions. Somewhere along the way, the safety was removed. Just like Morisaki’s Quick Draw, this was an entirely different type of pristine CAD drawing.

“How is it?”

“Hm…… Now I know how Shizuku feels.”

Everyone in the 1st Year Women’s Team knew about the fact that the Ojou-sama from the wealthy Kitayama Family wanted to “reserve” Tatsuya.

“Are there any problems?”

“Yep, it’s perfect!”

Eimi relaxed her posture and smiled in delight.

Apart from her ruby hair and moss green pupils, her outward appearance was thoroughly Japanese. Even among her peers, she was the one who had the most childish impression. Rather than calling her earlier smile “delightful”, a more innocent “teehee” was probably closer to the mark.

“I have no idea what you’re talking about……”

Eimi tilted her head at Tatsuya’s muttering, but her smile didn’t fade in the slightest. One of the chief reasons was likely because she had no idea what he was talking about.

“At least let me run a few calibrations. Can you put on the ear set?”

“Eh? Why?”

“Eimi…… In truth, you didn’t get up early, but didn’t sleep at all, right?”

At being asked this sudden question, Eimi’s smile grew a tad forced.

“……How could you tell?”

Seeing Eimi’s widened eyes, Tatsuya silently nodded and, in response, took the CAD from her hands and restarted the calibration process.

“……You’re sharper than my parents.”

Eimi obediently put on the headphones used for measurement while nagging with an “I can’t believe you” and placing her hands on the measuring pads.

Seeing the numbers scrolling down the screen, Tatsuya’s expression darkened.

With Tatsuya’s minute facial changes, Eimi’s body also started to curl up. This scene didn’t escape Miyuki’s eyes.

“Well, Onii-sama?”

There was no reprimand hidden in her words, but when Tatsuya heard her words, he raised his head in realization and smiled as he rubbed the space between his brows with two fingers.

“Unless Eimi also forgoes Sound Sleep?”

“Also? You mean Shiba-kun does that too?”

Eimi’s reaction prompted Tatsuya’s expression to soften somewhat as he nodded.

“Wow, I discovered a comrade. How should I put this, doesn’t that give you an uncomfortable feeling? Especially those weird sound waves.”

“There’s no actual health risk…… But I do agree that it is quite uncomfortable. I do make an exception for sleepless nights though. Especially if I have a competition the next day.”

“OK~.”

Eimi’s response was perfect for a child that had just been scolded by a parent. Tatsuya could only smile wryly at this.

“Then, I’ll raise the feedback loop a little higher…… This might be a little irritating, so bear with it for a little bit. Certainly you wouldn’t want to be accused of ‘losing the contest owing to lack of sleep’, right?”

“I’ll bear with it, please! If that really happened, they’ll never let me live this down.”

There was nothing worthy of note in her tone. Eimi blushed as she pressed her hands against several interesting points on her pants. Tatsuya paused and was frozen for a solid second.

“I really didn’t want to bring this up, but, Miyuki…… What do you people do in your rooms?”

“N, nothing, Onii-sama, Miyuki hasn’t done anything shameful!”





“Oh, really~? Miyuki’s room is a complete safe house.”

“Eimi! Do not speak of such strange nonsense in front of Onii-sama!”

An awkward silence covered the resting area. To break this stalemate, an abrupt change in the conversation was inevitable. He wasn’t entirely sure who this excuse was directed to, Tatsuya thought to himself.

“……Fortunately, the first round is in the early morning so you can take a nap before the second round begins. Sorry, Miyuki, but could I trouble you to prepare the ‘Sleeping Dock’ for immediate use?”

“I understand. I will be right back.”

After Miyuki departed to setup the sensory inhibitory dock (soundproof, shockproof, light-shielded, sealed single bed), Tatsuya started CAD calibration.




Although the first round got a little tense at one point, victory was finally achieved with three icicles still left in allied territory.

Speaking of which, the ending result was that Eimi was currently deep in dream land without any opportunity to complain that “It’s too dark~” or “It’s too cramped~”.

This was the fifth event, which was the second event for the female students from First High. They were currently in the resting area before the match began.

(I seem to recall saying something very similar recently.)

Tatsuya thought of this, but was still forced to say it aloud.

“Shizuku…… Are you really wearing that uniform during the competition?”

“Yeah?”

When Shizuku replied with an “Is something wrong?” expression on her face, Tatsuya really wanted to cover his head and was completely at a loss.

Icicle Destruction involved the players standing on four meter tall platforms and defending the 12 icicles in their own territory that measured 12 square meters while simultaneously knocking down or destroying all their opponent’s 12 icicles.

The players were strictly using long range magic, so there was no need to move their physical bodies.

In other words, the player’s wardrobe played no role in this event. (Besides the uniforms that hinder the grip on their CADs.)

The only criterion for wardrobe was that it “must be decent”.

And the ensuing result was that — while unintentional — at some point Women’s Icicle Destruction became a fashion show.

In addition, when Kanon appeared for the Official Division on the second and third days, she was wearing a fairly normal sports uniform. She wore tights, a mini jacket, an adequate shirt, as well as long socks and tennis shoes.

On the other hand, Eimi was dressed like a jockey, complete with a white collared shirt, red riding jacket on the upper body, tight women’s pants and black riding boots below, along with a black duck-billed hat.

Still, those still fell within normal boundaries and didn’t qualify as anything particularly gaudy.

Then, there was Shizuku……

“Uh, Shizuku……”

“Yes?”

“Wouldn’t the tamoto…… Get in the way?”

Yes.

No need to flog the dead horse, but that was a “tamoto” from a kimono.

“There’s no problem. The sleeves are short enough, and I also have the obi.”

Speaking of which, Shizuku deftly tied the obi in front of Tatsuya.

Such a fluid motion clearly showed that she had plentiful experience in a kimono.

Yet—

(If you needed to use the obi to keep the tamoto in check, wouldn’t you be better off forgoing the kimono in the first place?)

Tatsuya thought of this, but managed to hold his retort in.

There wasn’t much time before the next round, so Tatsuya quickly gave up on persuading her otherwise — after all, this was the “official garb” for boosting one’s spirits. In that case, he’ll just have to turn a blind eye.

Shizuku chose — correction, the CAD that Tatsuya chose for her was a Generalized CAD.

This implied that the event demanded a careful energy allocation that possessed a balanced strategy.

It wasn’t like Tatsuya could keep pulling rabbits out of a hat. To be precise, Tatsuya himself had no interest in creating devious tactics.

For him, it was all about providing the players with the most appropriate tools and the strategy that could bring about their maximum potential, and nothing more. In light of this, if direct assault was the most effective strategy, he would ruthlessly adopt that as his course of action.

Just like this match.

The moment Shizuku appeared on the platform, the audience raised a clamor likely due to her outfit.

However, the person in question was steady even if a light breeze had grazed her face as she lifted her left arm before her chest, the tamoto held firmly in place by the obi.

Shizuku’s CAD was just like the one she normally used, with the command console facing the inside of her arm.

In the recent age, most female Magicians used CADs with command consoles facing towards the outside. Despite the height of fashion, Shizuku still preferred to use the feminine inward facing console, which befitted her status as an Ojou-sama. Still, given her usual taciturn and emotionless nature as well as the occasional merciless snarking, this honestly gave people an incompatible feeling.

If voiced aloud in front of aforementioned young lady, this would undoubtedly end with a beating. Tatsuya adjusted the focal point on the monitoring device and set these thoughts aside.

In the following time period,

Shizuku’s mission was to focus entirely on this match.

Tatsuya’s mission was to gather his attention entirely on her.




“Miyuki…… Aren’t you going where Tatsuya-kun is?”

Honoka piped up from beside her. At this time, Miyuki was sitting in a different section of the stands reserved for players and auxiliaries that was not part of the normal audience stands and was patiently waiting for the match to begin.

Just as she did during Eimi’s match in the first round, the moment Tatsuya entered the monitoring room, Miyuki split apart from him.

It was perfectly natural for players from the same school to cheer on their teammates from the monitoring room, but—

“Icicle Destruction is a solo performance. Sooner or later, Shizuku and I will meet on the field, so wouldn’t it be unfair for me to sneak a peek at her trump card?”

In terms of trump cards, there were certainly opportunities during practice to see them. Even First High wasn’t extravagant enough to prepare several large scale practice facilities for the Nine Schools Competition.

So, what Miyuki was actually referring to was something else.

They were fated to be opponents. Miyuki didn’t want to see Tatsuya, who was serving as their mutual technician, worry needlessly about such trivialities. This was probably Miyuki’s real concern.

At the same time, she didn’t want Shizuku to be distracted by her presence.

Honoka and Shizuku were close friends and rivals since elementary school. Until middle school, Honoka saw Shizuku as her strongest opponent and conversely, Shizuku also saw Honoka as her most formidable opponent.

In their cohort and circle of friends, no one could match them in terms of magical talent.

Upon entering high school and receiving official magic training, both Honoka and Shizuku yearned to meet someone — other than each other — who could push them to their limits. Yet, somewhere in the depths of their hearts, a stubborn belief that could not be eradicated told them that they would never meet someone who mirrored their talents.

In the same school, in the same tutoring class, there were no children from the Ten Master Clans, but several children from the “Numbers System”. Still, none of them was worthy of being a new rival.

However, upon entering the high school entrance examination, their “conceit” was thoroughly annihilated.

By this divinely crafted young lady sitting next to her.

Based on their grades on the standardized magic tests, Honoka was fourth place behind Miyuki, Shizuku, and Morisaki. In Honoka’s opinion, even if Shizuku didn’t count, she didn’t feel that she was any weaker than Morisaki.

The first subject in the high school standardized exam was a simple technique involving ten processes. (Only someone of Honoka’s caliber would be able to call “ten processes” as simple.)

There was no real stress from the technique and Morisaki only seized the advantage because of his superior speed. If this was a more complex technique with additional processes, Honoka was adamant that she would have outperformed him.

Yet Miyuki was an “exception”.

She possessed the overwhelming ability and strength that made jealousy itself ludicrous.

Even if someone claimed she was from the Ten Master Clans, Honoka would undoubtedly hold that to be true.

But that was only natural.

—That was what Honoka thought when she first beheld Miyuki’s magic in the entrance examination area.

Honoka was completely unaware how close she was to the truth, proving beyond doubt how utterly Miyuki’s magic astounded and overwhelmed her.

This impression followed her for the next four months in school and, rather than being diluted, only intensified even more.

Honoka felt that even the solitary Shizuku would not be able to calmly manipulate her magic normally if Miyuki stood before her.

When she learned that Miyuki was being switched to Mirage Bat for the Official Division, and thus avoided meeting her on the field, Honoka let out a huge sigh of relief.

As she thought back to the time of the entrance exam, Honoka was naturally reminded of the first time she saw “him”.

In reality, Honoka’s first encounter with Tatsuya was not the incident that occurred shortly after the day of enrollment. It was not the time when Erika and company were arrayed against them, with Honoka casting magics against school rules that would have landed her in a world of trouble with the Public Morals Committee Chief had Tatsuya not intervened. Honoka had encountered Tatsuya long before this incident.

Coincidentally on the day of the entrance examination, not just Miyuki, but Tatsuya was also in the same testing group as Honoka.

This pair of siblings was not outwardly similar.

Honoka didn’t possess the excess mental finesse to remember everyone’s names.

The reason Tatsuya left a lasting impression on Honoka wasn’t because he was Miyuki’s older brother.

His technical scores were only so-so.

Regardless of speed, strength, scale, every subject was thoroughly mundane and unappealing, to the point that they could be labeled as below average.

However, his magic was so beautiful it was breathtaking!

Honoka was incapable of analyzing Magic Sequences like Tatsuya.

Neither was she like Mizuki in her sensitivity towards psions and pushions.

When compared to normal Magicians, Honoka, who specialized in light wave oscillation magic, was only acutely sensitive towards the magical side effects that created light wave background noise.

An overabundance of interference or remnants of Magic Sequences would all form into surplus psion surges and oscillate in the empty air. When photons interact with these responses, the ensuing result is light wave noise.

But this cacophony was wholly undetectable in his magic.

In other words, there were no excess materials in his Magic Sequence. His Magic Power was expanded to its limit and entirely devoted towards phenomenon rewriting, making for a magic that was calculated down to the last detail.

Honoka thought that it was a work of pure art.

Hitherto, she had never seen such a beautiful piece of magic.

Afterwards, even though she bore witness to Miyuki’s dominating magic, she still couldn’t forget that magic.

That’s why Honoka felt deeply betrayed when she saw the lack of the eight petal flower on Tatsuya’s breast during the student orientation.

This was the reason why Honoka nursed an overly antagonistic attitude towards Tatsuya’s group that day.

—Why are you on that side (Course 2)!?

—Why aren’t you on this one (Course 1)!?

Honoka’s eyes were blurred by this illogical fury.

True, in terms of speed, strength and scale, every category clearly set him far from the standards (of a Course 1 student).

Yet, the fact that “he” who could weave such wondrous magic had to be satisfied with being a mere “substitute (Weed)”, Honoka felt that this was utterly unforgivable.

“……Honoka, what’s wrong?”

Shocked, Honoka turned to her side to find Miyuki watching her in confusion.

She must have noticed that Honoka had fallen into an odd state of silence in the middle of their conversation.

“S-Sorry, it’s nothing.”

Even she would suspect herself if something of that sort had happened. When she considered her actions as well as her misdirected “anger displacement” and the reason why she consciously noticed “him”, Honoka blushed to the roots of her hair and drooped her head.




“It’s finally Kitayama’s match.”

“Looks like she’s carrying a Generalized CAD.”

Two ladies from the Women’s Team brass were hunched shoulder to shoulder in front of a screen at the pavilion. Suzune, who was overloaded with work from the unending stream of results, sighed as she beheld this sight.

Yet, the two of them blatantly ignored this obvious sign of displeasure.

“I wonder what trick he’s got up his sleeve this time.”

“Hard to say. Maybe he’s intentionally playing mind games with us and will launch a full frontal assault precisely because we’re thinking that way.”

Mayumi and Mari were congregated in front of the widescreen monitor just like two young children sharing their favorite television show.

Suzune had long since given up. Sighing once more, she accepted the inevitability of working alone.

Neither Mayumi nor Mari batted an eyelid at Shizuku’s choice of wardrobe.

For three time Nine Schools Competition veterans like them, this didn’t qualify as anything outlandish.

In fact, they may be thinking “Huh, there are actually less of them this year!”

Also owing to this reason, Shizuku was someone who came to watch the Nine Schools Competition every year, so she wasn’t embarrassed by her dress either.

“Ho, we’re starting.”

The two of them edged closer to the screen.




The lights next to the flanks of the arena flashed red.

The lights advanced to yellow, and the moment when the lights turned green—

Shizuku’s ring started dancing along the command console.

Toward her own 12 icicles.

She set all of them as targets and fired the Magic Sequence.

Immediately afterward, her opponent’s magic came rushing towards Shizuku’s field.

This was a popular tactic involving Move-Type Magic to blitzkrieg the opponent’s field.

Except Shizuku’s icicles stood rock solid against her opponent’s magic and didn’t shift at all.




“Ho, Data Fortification.”

Every HQ was equipped with a widescreen monitor that could analyze the magic being used as well as the type of magic used and its strength. Much like a heat display, the various displays were expressed through various shades of color.

Using this function, it was a simple matter to determine the offensive and defensive positions.

Data Fortification.

Eidos was a record of the current status of an information body. Through this information body, parts of the information or even the entire whole could be replicated and projected back into the target to protect the Eidos from being altered any further. This was known as Data Fortification within the Counter Magic field. The copied portions from Data Fortification possess the ability to prevent magic from affecting the target.

Shizuku used Data Fortification to emphasize the target’s location “right there”. As the screen plainly displayed, her opponent’s Move-Type Magic was nullified by Shizuku’s magic.

“Quite the direct confrontation.”

“Wasn’t this precisely how Mari predicted?”

Suzune, who overheard the conversation, couldn’t help but think: “Not really, I hardly think that this strategy was created solely to play with your heads……” Of course, this thought couldn’t be passed to the mesmerized observers.

“Still, I think that for Magicians with high interference strength like Kitayama-san, rather than using Data Fortification, she should use wide area interference as a ‘frontal assault’.”

“Based on yesterday’s results, Kitayama also has high magic capacity that is hard to find. She shouldn’t feel any stress from copying the Eidos. Also, for Interference-Type Magic, Data Fortification is more efficient compared to wide area interference.”

On the screen, her opponent once again tried to use Move-Type Magic to attack, but was nullified just as before.

Simultaneously, just as the attacking magic faded away—

Three of the icicles in the opponent’s field shattered.

“……What just happened right now? Mayumi, did you catch that?”

Mari asked in confusion, but Mayumi turned around without any confidence in her expression.

“I can only guess based on the data from the screen……”

Obviously, observing the analysis was vastly different from feeling the magic from the front lines.

“I think, that may have been the application of ‘Resonance’.”

The monitor was unable to keep up with the effects of indirect magic on the target, so the only way to narrow down what magic was used was through the surrounding environment.

“She shifted the irregular frequency from the Oscillation Magic into her opponent’s field and locked the frequency just as it started to resonate with the icicles and raised the output at the same time, thus creating resonance. I think that’s how it was.”

“So that’s how she did it…… To avoid Counter Magic, she didn’t directly attack the icicles using magic attacks, but used the ground as a medium. While they both used the ground as a medium, when compared to Kanon’s ‘Mine Genesis’ that relied purely on physical power, this is a much higher level technique. Sometimes I really can’t tell who the upperclassman is.”

“Precisely because finding the resonance point takes some time, she used Data Fortification to buy time. She looks very adept with manipulating the oscillation frequency.”

“Indeed.”

Mayumi and Mari were both thinking about the Non-Systematic Magic Tatsuya used to crush Hattori. It also utilized precisely manipulated psion surges to create overlapping oscillations.

What was being displayed on the monitor wasn’t just Shizuku’s artistic ability, but the hand of Tatsuya working from behind the scenes. On that point, neither of them disagreed.




(As expected of Shizuku, she’s doing admirably……)

Tatsuya quietly nodded as he surveyed the players from the opposite side of the screen.

Four icicles had already fallen in the opposing field.

All 12 icicles were still standing in the allied field.

The biological displays on the screen revealed only minor exhaustion, so there was no impact on the ability to maintain magic invocation.

There was no trace of any symptoms that could exhaust a player like the ones Eimi displayed. And regardless of whether it was “Data Fortification” or “Resonance”, her performance was just as expected. Nay, her performance surpassed what she could do in training.

Half of Mayumi and Mari’s hypothesis was spot on, but the other half was incorrect. Shizuku’s mother was the one who specialized in “Resonance”. Before teaming up with Tatsuya, Shizuku was already well versed in that technique (by a high school student’s standards).

By using magic that raised the oscillation frequency at irregular levels and directly projecting that on the target while synchronizing the frequencies, this destroyed the target using precise oscillation frequencies at the exact moment when resistance was the weakest. Originally, “Resonance” was this type of two-stage process. When applying oscillation-type magic onto the target object, a Magician can feel out the resonance point based on the Eidos’ resistance to the interfering Magic Sequence; if using regular intervals, then an alternate method would have to be used to identify the target’s resonance.

This was not reliant on monitoring devices, but done while compiling Activation Sequences into Magic Sequences. That was the part that Tatsuya was responsible for.

This technique was created by adding a new process into the “Resonance” magic that Shizuku was familiar with. Yet, Shizuku was able to wield this at will. Obviously, this level of skill was not obtained by just training in school, but honed through long hours of practice outside of class.

As another icicle collapsed in the enemy’s field, one of the allied icicles collapsed as well.

However, this was only her opponent’s “last gasp”. Tatsuya could tell with a glance.

The opposing player threw everything she had into that last attack. She most likely knew the writing on the wall, but desperately wanted to avoid being defeated without knocking down a single icicle.

Tatsuya watched Shizuku’s back with his own eyes and not through the monitor.

The psions she was releasing were not ruffled in the slightest.

No sense of wavering, no hint of pride. At the same time that she vigorously defended her own territory, she retaliated against her opponent’s field.

Probably because she wasn’t fixated on her opponent for some bizarre reason. She was fighting in a manner that put anyone watching her at ease.

Her opponent, who had expended all her energy, did not put up any futile resistance.

The three icicles in the enemy’s territory shattered apart like a sand castle standing against the incoming tide.




Miyuki’s match was the last one in the first round.

This was a long wait from early morning, but since lunch time was also figured into the time, this didn’t feel that long for her.

Speaking of Tatsuya, he was also up since morning and this was his third match, so he was hardly “waiting”.

Miyuki and Tatsuya were the only ones in the resting area for players.

Honoka and Shizuku were nowhere in sight.

They had mentioned during lunch that they would be cheering her on during the match. Now, they probably already met up with Erika’s crew.

In recompense, which was hardly the issue at hand, Isori and Kanon as well as Mayumi and Mari came to support her.

(It’s a huge cheerleading party……)

Tatsuya wore a helpless look on his face as he murmured in the privacy of his mind. Of course, he actually said something else.

“I’m glad that you all came to cheer on Miyuki, but…… Chief, shouldn’t you be in bed?”

“What, even you’re treating me like an invalid? It’s not like I have to hop around and dance, so there’s no problem.”

Yet, it was still a serious injury. Tatsuya swallowed those words and directed the conversation towards Mayumi.

“Oh…… Then shouldn’t the President be at the pavilion? I thought the Men’s Team is still in the middle of their event.”

“No problem. I left that to Hanzou-kun. I’m also stepping down two months from now, so it’s not a good idea to rely on me for everything.”

This was a valid argument, but smacked of someone feigning silliness.

Still, their presence wasn’t going to negatively affect the match, so continuing this conversation would do more harm than good.

“Miyuki, we have so many reliable senpais here to cheer you on, make sure you’re not more anxious than usual.”

Pfft, someone was snickering in the back, but Tatsuya chose to ignore that.

Apparently, he was doting on Miyuki too much. But for Tatsuya, his sister was always (logically) going to be his sister.

“Please do not concern yourself. Because Onii-sama is by my side.”

Following that, Miyuki raised her head and gazed at her brother whom she had complete faith in. In her ears, all other sounds became inaudible.




Miyuki’s appearance on the platform threw the crowd into pandemonium.

“That, incredibly, that is……”

“But suits her quite well. What do you think, Kanon?”

“I say, that’s simply gorgeous.”

Tatsuya tuned out Kanon and Isori’s conversation like it was a BGM and focused on preparations to monitor Miyuki’s status. In the blink of an eye, the preparations were complete. Tatsuya peered towards Miyuki and suddenly realized: “Right, that’s what everyone is staring at.”

Miyuki was dressed in a fine white hakui paired with a crimson hakama. Her hair was held back by a white strap.

True, the hairstyle was slightly different and if in place of a CAD she held bells or a sakai, she would be even more stunning. It was that kind of garb.

Originally, she was already gorgeous and now paired with this wardrobe, she gave off an almost divine aura.

No, perhaps she had already surpassed divine possession and was now approaching the realms of the gods themselves.

“Ouch, her opponent seems to have been submerged.”

“Nothing they can do about that. Even I must admit that I can’t hold a candle to that. ……Ah, unless that was the goal all along?”

Mayumi and Mari’s voices from behind him were plainly directed towards himself. Tatsuya turned around and replied.

“By goal, you mean what? There’s nothing particularly astounding about using that attire for magic ceremonies.”

Still, his answer was literally the answer to a literal question, but there was clearly a mismatch in what both sides wanted to communicate.

“……Tatsuya-kun’s family follows the Shinto system?”

This time the question was even more off the mark. After Mayumi’s unrelenting pursuit, Tatsuya didn’t hesitate as he shook his head.

“Hardly, it’s simply because we’re Japanese.”

“……Really, maybe, fine.”

Mayumi reluctantly nodded. Tatsuya left with a “Let’s end the conversation here” and turned back towards the monitors.

Tatsuya’s words themselves were hard to deny and were fairly logical.

Yet, if someone witnessed the entire process, they would immediately be able to tell that he wasn’t being uniform the entire time.

They were both kimonos, but Tatsuya had a conflicted view of Shizuku’s tamotos yet didn’t question his own sister’s miko getup. Tatsuya’s sensibilities on this — objectively speaking — were indeed suspicious.




Miyuki was wholly unaware of the drama unfolding on the back stage — well, that was only to be expected — as she calmly waited for the start signal.

“False starts” were a major violation of the rules.

Being overly enthusiastic could subconsciously activate magic, which was your own fault. Well aware of this fallacy, Miyuki wasn’t fired up during the waiting period like all the other players, but was concentrating on restraining herself.

……In the eyes of others, this was a “posture of silence”.

The signal lights on both ends of the arena flashed red.

Miyuki opened her faintly closed eyes and gazed directly at the enemy field.

A sigh arose from the audience.

And not just in one area either, but from nearly the entire arena.

Surprisingly, it wasn’t the young men, but the young women who were mesmerized by that fiery gaze.

This was no longer the atmosphere expected from mere spectating.

With apologies to the other player, the entire audience was fixated on Miyuki’s every move.

The signal light flashed yellow, and just as it turned green—

An intense psion light flooded the entire area without heed to allied or enemy territories.

Yet, the arena — had turned into two different seasons.

An absolute chill enshrouded Miyuki’s field.

A burning heat wave flooded her opponent’s field.

The icicles in her opponent’s field started to melt.

Her opponent was desperately trying to apply cooling magic with no apparent effect whatsoever.

Her own position had turned into a frozen hell that surpassed the winds of winter.

Her opponent’s field transformed into a scorched purgatory that rivaled summer’s might.

Still, all of this lasted only the briefest of moments.

Swiftly,

Her field was completely enveloped in chilling mist.

While her opponent’s field was devoured by the rising steam.





“That can’t be……”

“Inferno……?”

Behind him, Tatsuya could hear Mari and Mayumi’s murmurs and groans.

They were certainly spot on, Tatsuya thought, yet he didn’t turn around.

Tatsuya’s gaze was still locked on the display of Miyuki’s back from the monitoring device.

Medium-Scale Oscillation-Type Magic “Inferno”.

By dividing the target area into two sections and decreasing the kinetic and rotational energy of all objects within one section, this surplus energy could be released into the other section in the form of heat. This way, conservation of energy was still maintained while applying the principle of reverse entropy from thermodynamics.

Occasionally, this magic served as the test for A-Rank Magicians. Many testers shed bitter tears at their inability to wield this highly difficult magic, but for Miyuki, this was merely a triviality that she could manipulate at will.

Since this was originally an area-of-effect magic, there was no need to worry needlessly about magic leaking outside and breaking the rules. Still, the very definition of magic forced Magicians to be extremely careful even with the simplest of techniques. If an incident were to occur, she would immediately be disqualified from the match, which would prompt him to intervene by any means necessary. This was what was running across Tatsuya’s mind as he watched Miyuki.

However, he appeared to be agitated over nothing.

The temperature in the enemy’s field rocketed past 200 degrees Celsius.

Flash freeze icicles that were formed in a hurry were nothing more than rough ice cubes with countless pockets of air within. These pockets would rapidly expand when heated, causing the icicle itself to crack despite the icicle becoming more fluid under the heat.

Suddenly, the temperature stopped rising.

Immediately afterwards, a shock wave burst spread across the enemy field.

Miyuki had switched magics.

She was compressing and releasing the air.

Every frail icicle within the enemy field shattered as one.




There were a total of 360 contestants and 72 technicians. While some schools waived their right to tactical advisors, the number of total participants in the Nine Schools Competition still exceeded 450 students. If there was a ball (or even banquet), this number of people could still be managed, but that was practically impossible to achieve on a daily basis during the main event.

Breakfast was done buffet style on a first come, first serve basis. Lunch consisted of bentos being delivered to each school’s pavilion or engineering vehicles, though some people chose to take them back to their rooms. Dinner was served in the three dining halls over three separate sessions, with each school getting one hour to dine. (The schools dined separately to avoid their tactics leaking to other schools.)

Actually, dinner was the only opportunity for the entire school team to congregate in the dining hall.

This one hour of dinner was an invaluable time for sharing the day’s triumphs and regrets.

Tonight, at the First High tables, a clear line was drawn between light and darkness.

Darkness covered the corner where the 1st Year male players were gathered.

Light enshrouded the corner where the 1st Year female players were gathered.

And among the dense jungle of female players, the small dash of red (or maybe green is more appropriate in the jungle?) was, of course, Tatsuya.



“Miyuki, that was totally awesome.”

“So that’s ‘Inferno’? The senpais were completely shocked. It’s said that even A-Rank Magicians have problems with that ability.”

“Eimi, nicely done! Your first match was a little tight though.”

“Cavalier gear with carbine stance, nice!”

“Shizuku was great too! Your kimono with tamoto was simply beautiful, then you forced your opponent steadily into a corner. Cool~!”

While the Newcomers Division Crowd Ball only clinched one Second Place and one Sixth Place, yielding a “so-so” result, the dominating performance from the Icicle Destruction players allowed all three to advance to the third round, continuing the triumphant performance from the Speed Shooting event. This caused the female players to bask in a festive mood.

The format of the Icicle Destruction event had 24 players in total, with 12 matches in the first round and 6 matches in the second round. With three people advancing to the third round, First High laid claim to fully half of the players still in the field.

The three victors from the third round would then engage in a round robin to decide the ultimate victor, though based on the current situation, there was a strong possibility that all three of those positions may be claimed by players from First High. If so, that would truly be an astounding feat. The very fact that this remained a distinct possibility made it “impossible” for them not to be beside themselves with joy.

The upperclassmen all wore smiles that said “What are we going to do with you guys” as the underclassmen danced around in joy.

“Shiba-kun, Shizuku’s ability was a ‘Resonance’ variant, right?”

The 1st Year female student who came over was not one of the players Tatsuya was responsible for. He was aware of who she was, but was not overly familiar. Wholly ill at ease (Miyuki vetoed his request to sit elsewhere) as he dined, Tatsuya was suddenly the center of attention and finally managed a somewhat ordinary reply.

“That is correct.”

Quite the detached reply but even so, his voice was slightly gentler than usual. While they were peers in the same cohort, the other person was a Course 1 female student that he rarely interacted with normally. Tatsuya was taking precautions not to frighten her off by accident.

Unfortunately, this caution brought about a crescendo in response.

“So the Activation Sequence was really designed by Shiba-kun?”

“I heard that Shiba-kun developed the technique Shizuku used during Speed Shooting, right?”

“Shiba-kun also devised the strategy for Inferno too.”

“Rumor has it that Shiba-kun was also the mastermind behind Honoka’s flashbang strategy.”

The continuous stream of questions gave him no room to maneuver and continuously drained his mental facilities, not that there was anything Tatsuya could do about it. Still, they were currently in a stimulated state which likely used the current festive mood as stress relief for the continuous anxiety from the competition. From another perspective, this exaggerated praise may even be seen as flaunting in order to raise their self-confidence to combat that feeling of unease that couldn’t be easily dispelled. Tatsuya could understand that feeling, so he intentionally avoided dampening their enthusiasm and patiently continued to listen.

“That’s great…… If Shiba-kun was my support, I could probably win too.”

However, this phrase was still taking things too far and couldn’t be ignored.

Despite this, he probably shouldn’t be the one who pointed this out. Tatsuya glanced subtly at Miyuki, who was sitting beside him.

“Nanabi, I think there’s something wrong with that sentiment.”

Upon being gently reprimanded, this female student immediately realized that her words could be easily mistaken for her dissatisfaction with her supporting technician.

Her attitude did a complete 180 as she frantically rose to her feet, babbling the entire time, and searched the upperclassmen for the engineer responsible for her. Upon discovering the engineer smiling and waving at her, she finally let out a deep sigh of relief, bowed deeply in apology, then returned to her seat.

“I-I spoke poorly.”

“Nana, you can’t place your own inadequacies all on the CAD.”

“Teehee…… Reflecting.”

The volume level for the young ladies’ conversation had dropped considerably, but didn’t nearly qualify as whispering.

“But there is no doubt that thanks to Shiba-kun, I’m performing much better than usual.”

This time it was Takigawa, a female student that took Third Place in Speed Shooting, who spoke up. Eimi nodded excessively at this.

“On some level, CAD calibration is the same thing as telling your darkest secrets, isn’t it? And towards a male engineer to boot…… While I did think like that in the beginning, but to have Shiba-kun be my engineer is simply incredible! Here’s to the boys who were willing to yield Shiba-kun to us!”

Tatsuya could only smile wryly at the massive misunderstanding hidden behind that innocent smile.

However, there were also people who couldn’t muster even a wry smile.

“Ah, hey!”

With a violent “bang”, one of the boys stood up.

Heedless of anyone trying to stop him, Morisaki picked up his silverware and headed towards the catering area before leaving the dining hall altogether.




Coincidentally at the same time.

Though it wasn’t a sumptuous feast, there was an entire array of high class Chinese cuisine — far more lavish than any high school banquet — spread across the table that was surrounded by a crowd of dismal expressions. There was a colossal difference between the luxurious gold and red decorations and the dour faces of the men present.

“……Wasn’t Third High supposed to be favored for the Newcomers Division?”

They were conversing in English.

“We finally managed to force Watanabe to bow out, but…… If this continues, wouldn’t First High triumph again?”

However, the people present showed clear signs of mixed European and East Asian heritage.

“If the favored candidate wins, the house will be hemorrhaging money!”

“There are a lot of VIPs in the casinos this time. Even if we do pay out, this isn’t a small sum for us. We’ll probably be facing a gaping deficient in the beginning of the business quarter. If that’s the case……”

The men peered at one another with grave expressions.

“……Everyone here will be purged by headquarters. Based on the size of our loss, the head may do the honors himself!”

One of the men murmured softly as he peered at the snaking dragon embroidered with gold thread in the middle of the hanging axle.

A heavy silence fell over all the men.

“Dying might be the best thing that could happen to us……”

Someone muttered.

In a voice quaking with terror.




Unlike magic related sports events, gender differences didn’t really impact magic competitions.

Even so, when taking into account that physical abilities still hold the decisive edge in events like Battle Board or Crowd Ball, the Newcomers Division separated the genders from this year forth.

In other words, this was the first year that the men and women competed separately in the Newcomers Division.

Until last year, there was no separation by gender, so men usually competed in events like Battle Board or Crowd Ball, while women chose to participate in events such as Icicle Destruction or Speed Shooting that were less taxing on the physical body. Thanks to this (the ratio favored male participants due to school differences), the audience was generally split between watching two different types of events.

So which was more popular, the Men’s competition or the Women’s competition?

Based on the Official Division from previous years, the average spectator usually observed the Women’s events, while the military, police, firefighters, and university related personnel paid closer attention to the Men’s competition.

—Then again, speaking of this year’s Newcomers Division.

“There are a lot of people here……”

“There were plainly more open seats during the Men’s competition.”

Two young ladies were sitting in the empty reserved observation area and cast pitying gazes across the spectator stands that were filled to capacity.

They were Mayumi and Mari.

“Somehow, I feel that there are a lot of people from the universities.”

Mayumi said this as she directed her gaze towards the VIP stands.

“After seeing that yesterday, they wouldn’t be satisfied with just a recording, would they?”

Mari completely agreed.

“Exactly. Aren’t we here to watch as well?”

To preserve all fairness, the order of the matches was reversed from yesterday.

It was the sixth day of the Nine Schools Competition and third day of the Newcomers Division.

The first match of the third round in Icicle Destruction was about to take place.

Mayumi glanced at the time and waited for Miyuki to take the stage.




Turn back the clock for a few moments.

As Tatsuya and Miyuki were headed towards the resting area for Icicle Destruction, two students from Third High appeared before them.

Both of them were male students.

One of them matched Tatsuya’s physique in terms of height and shoulder width, to the point that it was extremely difficult to tell the difference. However, that student had a much more stunning appearance.

The other student was significantly shorter. Thanks in part to the school’s reputation for emphasizing martial abilities, this did not give off a weak impression.

They appeared to have noticed Tatsuya at the same time and directly walked towards him.

“I am Ichijou Masaki, Third High, 1st Year.”

The taller one spoke first.

For people that have just met for the first time, his tone was slightly overbearing, but amazingly, Tatsuya didn’t seem to mind.

While both of them were 1st Year students, Ichijou Masaki naturally fit into a leadership role and seemed to exude the charismatic aura of a true leader.

Both his eyes were focused on Tatsuya.

“Likewise, Kichijouji Shinkurou, also from Third High’s 1st Year.”

The shorter youth spoke politely and identified himself with a more traditional air, though his eyes teemed with a challenging glint.

“First High, 1st Year, Shiba Tatsuya. So, the ‘Crimson Prince’ and ‘Cardinal George’ in the flesh, what may I do for you?”

No sense of malice.

Slightly different from sheer enmity.

Still, there was no question that this was not a friendly attitude.

Strictly speaking, it was a naked fighting spirit.

Just like Masaki, Tatsuya also responded in a tone that would be considered overly rude for first acquaintances in his usual manner.

Tatsuya felt that putting on a mask of false friendship would be insulting to these two.

“Ho…… So you know of George’s reputation as well as mine? Well that makes this simple.”

“Shiba Tatsuya…… A hitherto unknown name, but I shall never forget this name. You are probably the most ingenious technician since the advent of the Nine Schools Competition. I’m afraid we are lacking in manners here, but all we wished for was to meet you once.”

“I am honored to be called a ‘genius’ by the prodigy that discovered the Cardinal Code at age 13…… But you are right in that this is against the norm.”

As for his own manner of speaking, he replied back in a frank and straightforward fashion.

Yet, neither of them appeared irritated. They came with absolute determination and maintained a posture one usually reserves for a serious opponent.

“Miyuki, go ahead and prepare.”

Tatsuya did not lift his eyes from these two as he gave his instructions to Miyuki. Tatsuya estimated that they would be here for a while.

“I understand.”

Miyuki bowed towards Tatsuya and departed for the resting area without sparing Masaki a single glance, as if the pair did not exist within her dimension. There wasn’t even a hint that she was intentionally avoiding them — that was how perfectly she rendered them to non-existence.

For an instant, Masaki’s eyes followed Miyuki, but swiftly reverted back to Tatsuya.





“……‘Prince’, isn’t your side about to begin?”

The split second of wavering and reluctance did not escape Tatsuya’s eyes. Inwardly, he let out a small breath.

Unwavering, Tatsuya’s eyes forced Masaki to reply.

“……We will appear in tomorrow’s Monolith Code.”

Yet, the one who replied for him was Kichijouji.

Kichijouji was the champion for the Newcomers Division Speed Shooting event, while Masaki was favored to clinch the crown for the Newcomers Division Icicle Destruction event. Naturally, it was expected that each school would commit their aces to the Monolith Code event.

“What are your plans?”

Although he wanted to ask what he was referring to, there wasn’t enough time left.

“I’m not responsible for that.”

That being said, he had no obligation to reveal any details, so he went with the abstract answer.

“Is that so…… That’s unfortunate. One day, I wish to line up against the players you’re responsible for. Of course, we will triumph.”

Kichijouji’s words caused Tatsuya to feel “Are you throwing down now?”. But he quickly thought otherwise, since these guys originally came to challenge him in the first place.

“Sorry for taking your time. We look forward to meeting on the field of battle.”

Before Tatsuya could respond to Kichijouji, Masaki made this declaration and walked past Tatsuya with Kichijouji.

—So they’re still a rude bunch in the end. Tatsuya thought as he headed towards the resting area where Miyuki was waiting for him without turning his head in the slightest.



“What were they up to?”

The first thing Miyuki asked when she came out of the changing room was about the earlier scene.

“Scouting, I think? Still felt pointless though.”

Tatsuya tilted his head and chose to reply in neutral terms and handed Miyuki the CAD he had prepared for her while she was changing.

If there were any extraneous distractions before the match, this would only negatively impact the match itself, so Tatsuya moved to curtail the conversation with haste. Yet, after Miyuki heard Tatsuya’s reply, she burst into laughter as if finding some profound meaning in his words.

“I think that’s their declaration of war, Onii-sama.”

He wasn’t ignorant of what his sister was referring to. He himself felt those two came to specifically challenge him.

But in Tatsuya’s eyes, this was a pointless gesture.

“……You don’t believe me?”

Even though Miyuki rolled her eyes upward and pouted sulkily, this wasn’t something he was going to let slide so easily.

“No, well…… I’m not a contestant, right? I don’t believe these two renowned individuals who have extended their reputations beyond the scope of magic high school students would view a nameless person like myself a rival.”

“Rival” was based on the assumption that they acknowledged that both sides were equal.

Objectively speaking, from outward appearances, he wasn’t even in the same strata as those two. Superficially, comparing themselves with him was a ridiculous notion. Furthermore, they didn’t appear to have discovered his secrets either.

Ordinarily, it was frankly impossible for the “Crimson Prince” or “Cardinal George” to see him as an opponent — Tatsuya thought.

Upon seeing her older brother actually thinking this way and not out of humility, the sister sighed deeply.

“……Onii-sama, underestimating your own abilities would be fatal in battle. Exactly how highly you are valued, how greatly you are watched, even how much other schools view Onii-sama — how fiercely their antagonism burns because of Onii-sama’s skills and strategies — I think Onii-sama should consider all of this objectively once more.”

For Miyuki, this was an exceedingly rare, and blunt, counsel.

This was a completely unexpected boldness and unimaginable reproach. Tatsuya could only stand there and watch her blankly.

This was the third time Miyuki used her mysterious beauty to captivate the hearts of the audience at the same time that she wielded her terrible might to vanquish the enemy.




On the waves where Battle Board would be decided, the first round of the Women’s semifinals was about to begin.

The players were already at their starting positions.

Honoka’s figure was among them.

“Hm~”

“…………”

“That’s a little……”

“…………”

“OK, that, uh……”

“…………”

“What the heck are you two doing?”

All three players were side by side at the starting line. In the stands, Erika was humming in frustration while Mizuki was utterly silent by her side. Finally caving, Leo asked reluctantly.

“Isn’t that just~, a little strange? All the players are wearing sunglasses.”

“Erika-chan, those are called ‘goggles’……”

Indeed, just as Erika and Miyuki said, not just Honoka, but the other two were wearing dark protective goggles as well.

“Isn’t that obvious? This is the most reliable countermeasure to Honoka-san’s light magic.”

Mikihiko’s analysis was grounded in common sense, causing Erika to adopt a “How boring~” expression as she laughed mirthlessly.

“……What’s wrong with that?”

“But~, doesn’t that mean they fell for Tatsuya-kun’s strategy? Battle Board players don’t use goggles because the water droplets may interfere with their sight. This is a key reason. Yet they quickly adopted goggles after being flashed once…… There should be other ways to counter light magic……”

“Is Honoka-san planning on using the water to obscure their vision?”

Erika nodded in disinterest.

However.

“That’s hard to say…… I doubt that Tatsuya will rely on such a mundane tactic.”

“……Possibly.”

Mikihiko’s words seemed to rouse some of Erika’s interest.



This time, no flash occurred immediately after the start.

“She’s slow out the gate!?”

“No, she’s right behind!”

As they navigated the snaking tunnel in front of the observation deck, Honoka was in second place entering the first sharp curve.

“Eh?”

At this location, the player in first place took an odd route.

Not only did she massively reduce speed, she even drew close to the middle of the route.

Honoka also decelerated, but took a steeper angle that just barely cleared the bend and snatched first place from the player who took the roundabout route.

“What, just happened?”

Normally, players either reduced speed drastically and hugged the inside route, or took a wider angle but controlled their deceleration.

The route taken by the other player could be described as amateurish. Not only did she drastically reduce speed, she also left a huge passing lane.

“……There seem to be shadows floating in the waterways.”

Following Leo’s observation, Erika squinted and shouted out.

“Ah, there it is again!”

This time it was a wide arc way.

The player that Honoka passed once again left a huge gap between her and the wall and slowed down more than necessary to pass the angle. The ensuing result left her farther and farther behind Honoka.

“……No wonder, so that’s how it is.”

“Eh, what?”

Erika asked Mikihiko, who was nodding in appreciation.

“Tatsuya’s intent was to have the other players don goggles that are shaded against light. This point coincided with Erika’s guess.”

Mikihiko spoke with animation, as if completely abandoning his usual irrational stubbornness.

“However, this isn’t for using the water spray to occlude their sight, but to make the dark areas harder to perceive.”

“So that’s why! Illusions can also be used like this……!”

“Indeed. By turning the lit areas darker, you are able to manipulate your opponent’s moves. Ultimately, magic depends on application……”

“……Would the two of you care to enlighten me as well instead of amusing yourselves.”

At Leo’s displeased voice, Mikihiko finally stirred from his daydream.

“Sorry, sorry. In other words, Tatsuya’s strategy is……”




“Shiba-kun’s strategy is very simple.

He used light wave oscillation magic to control the light along the water route.

The protective goggles already restricted vision considerably. This is now compounded by the darkened route, causing people to misjudge the distance to the edge, hereby forcing the opposing players away from the darkness…… In summation, he narrowed the area the players dared to navigate through.”

Hattori, with Kirihara in tow, was holding the fort in place of Katsuto, who had gone to observe the Men’s Icicle Destruction event. They were currently listening to every word of Suzune’s explanation.

“Even if the mind says otherwise and claims that the water’s surface shoulder is wider, it remains a difficult task to override physical perception. At the same time, regardless of who the player is, anyone would have a harder time raising their speed along a narrow corridor. Thus, this strategy is grounded in denying the other players from bringing out their full potential.”

“……But, wouldn’t Honoka-san be affected herself?”

“That’s why she has repeatedly trained under similar conditions.”

Hattori’s question prompted a simplistic answer.

“……Generally, the user remains unaffected by the magic itself, so no worries.”

“Don’t relax just yet. Shiba-kun said that ‘the width of the water way is fixed, so use your body rather than your eyes to memorize it’.”

Hearing Suzune’s reply, Kirihara muttered.

“……So rather than being a clever strategy, it turned out to be a full frontal assault anyway…… This could only come from someone with one hell of a mean streak.”

Kirihara’s impression caused Suzune to burst into laughter.




After the morning matches, the pavilion reserved for First High turned into an ocean of festivities.

All three participants in the Newcomers Division Women’s Icicle Destruction third round won.

In the round robin portion of the event during the afternoon, every player came from First High.

Honoka also advanced to the finals for Battle Board. This was a result that could only be described as “dominating”.

The only people who couldn’t join in the fun were the ten players from the 1st Year Men’s team.

If they competed normally, the male members would surely achieve similarly impressive results. That being said, their blind animosity led to repeated mental errors that only increased as their numbers dwindled and their frustration mounted, throwing them into a vicious cycle of self-destruction.

Among them, the three players from Icicle Destruction — Miyuki, Shizuku, and Eimi, as well as Tatsuya, the technician responsible, were not present because they were summoned to one of the hotel’s conference rooms.

“We’re pressed for time, so I’ll keep this short.”

Mayumi was the one who called them here. She was the only one waiting for them.

“Until now, no school has ever monopolized the round robin portion of this event. Shiba-san, Kitayama-san, Akechi-san, your performances have been exemplary.”

Politely, calmly, and frantically, the three of them displayed three different attitudes as they bowed in thanks to Mayumi’s praise.

“In recognition of this feat, the board has a proposal. They say that regardless of what the standings for the round robin are, our school will receive all the points anyway, so there’s no need to play this out. All three of you will share First Place collectively.”

The three of them looked at one another, with Tatsuya smiling sardonically in the back.

No matter how they tried to disguise this, the board was obviously trying to lighten his workload.

“It is up to all of you whether to accept the board’s proposal. The only criterion is that you don’t have much time to consider this. Please make a decision here and now.”

Upon hearing Mayumi’s words, Eimi started fidgeting as her eyes roamed around.

With her skill level, she was well aware that she had no chance against either Miyuki or Shizuku.

Up until this point, she was satisfied with Third Place, but it was simply human nature for people to desire First Place. It was too much of a stretch for her not to want this to happen.

Miyuki glanced at Tatsuya.

Shizuku also looked towards Tatsuya.

“Tatsuya-kun, what is your opinion? If all three were to fight it out, you would have a hard time managing all three.”

So, Mayumi wished for the three of them to share First Place together, Tatsuya thought.

In truth, this was the most desirable outcome from the leadership’s perspective.

“To be honest, based on Akechi-san’s current condition, she would be better off avoiding the next round. The third round was too heated and it’s hard to imagine that she can recover in one or two hours.”

From Tatsuya’s perspective, he didn’t feel that he has to worry on this account. He was just speaking candidly.

“Is that so…… Akechi-san, do you agree with what Tatsuya-kun said?”

“Well, that…… Before I heard what you said, I was already ready to give up anyway. It is true that I’m not in optimal condition, so I was planning on bowing out after talking it over with Shiba-kun anyway…… Because Shiba-kun knows me better than I know myself.”

Her tone was diffident, likely because she felt that she was shirking her responsibilities by accepting the board’s proposal.

“Really.”

Mayumi smiled to console her and nodded before turning to Miyuki and Shizuku.

“I……”

Shizuku spoke up first.

“Want to compete.”

Her eyes burned with fiery determination as she looked Mayumi in the eye.

“After this, how many opportunities will I have to go all out against Miyuki…… I don’t want to miss this chance.”

“How unfortunate……”

Mayumi dropped her gaze to the ground and sighed.

“What does Miyuki-chan think?”

“If Kitayama-san wishes to compete against me, I have no reason to refuse.”

Mayumi knew very well that Miyuki was made of sterner stuff that belied her appearance, so she was completely unsurprised by this response.

“I understand…… Then, I will report to the board that Akechi-san has withdrawn whereas Shiba-san and Kitayama-san will engage in a duel to decide the final round. The match should be the first one of the afternoon, so you had best take this opportunity to prepare.”

After Mayumi finished speaking, the first one to bow was Tatsuya.

As he left the conference room, Miyuki and Shizuku immediately bowed to Mayumi and left right behind him. Eimi frantically bowed as well and said: “I’ll take my leave.”




The stands were overflowing with spectators.

The changes in the Newcomers Division Women’s Icicle Destruction event were quickly announced and intentionally set as the first match of the afternoon to avoid conflicting with other events.

Not just the normal stands, but even the reserved seating area for members was quickly filled.

There, Tatsuya could be seen sandwiched between Mayumi and Mari.

After finishing the calibrations for both their CADs, Tatsuya didn’t accompany either Miyuki or Shizuku, but sat in the last row of the reserved seating area.

Before leaving, he left the two of them with these words.

The words, “Do your best”.

“But in reality, you wanted to stay by Miyuki’s side, didn’t you?”

Alas, the rare “well meaning words” took on a different connotation when delivered from her lips as Mayumi revealed an evil smirk. For some reason, whenever she was with Tatsuya, her fiendish side seemed to rise dramatically.

“Yeah.”

Undoubtedly because she was annoyed by Tatsuya’s wooden reaction.

“……You sure admitted that easily.”

Although she gave pretense to being mean, Mari’s real nature was — perhaps — much kinder than Mayumi as she interjected with her almost signature retort.

“Do you know what Sister Complex means?”

“I don’t think I follow. How does cheering on your own kin constitute being a sis-con?”

His direct rebuttal while feigning ignorance had long since become customary.

Except Mayumi and Mari had wised up to his tactics.

“Wow, did you hear that Mari? This child is actually confident in his own cause!”

“Looks seriously ill to me. Is it hopeless?”

Isn’t it pointless to loudly gossip about the person stuck between them? Tatsuya thought. He was thoroughly helpless against this special way of “bullying the underclassman”.



This short skit was nothing more than the appetizer before the curtains were drawn.

As if to prove this, when both players took the stage, the entire audience fell into complete silence.

In the arena, two young women stood facing one another.

On one side, her white hakui and crimson hakama filled the eyes.

On the other side, tamotos the color of water flooded the vision.

Miyuki didn’t bind her hair; Shizuku didn’t bring an obi.

The long, wavy hair and silk tamotos fluttered in the slight winds of summer.

The two young women were suffused with a suffocating silence.

This was the chilling “fighting spirit” that shared the name of this purely magical contest and was far removed from its burning counterpart.

The preparation signal light lit up.

The colors changed, and at the moment the beacon responsible for starting the match went off—

Magic flooded outward at the same moment.

A heat wave rushed towards Shizuku’s field.

Yet, the icicles stubbornly resisted the incursion.

The wide area heat wave from “Inferno” was denied by the “Data Fortification” magic that stopped the changes in the icicles’ temperature.

The earth groaned as magic rushed towards Miyuki’s field.

But the oscillations were stamped out the moment they tried to resonate.

Wide area magic prevented oscillations and movement within her own field and extended across the earth’s surface and below it as well.



The two of them went back and forth, taking turns using phenomenon rewriting on the other’s icicles. This was a perfect stalemate, worthy of the praise from all the pundits and experts — on the outside.

But the combatants involved didn’t think so.

(I can’t get in……! As expected of Miyuki!)

Shizuku’s “Resonance” was completely rejected by the enemy field.

In comparison, Miyuki’s heat wave was enveloping Shizuku’s field.

“Data Fortification” is a counter magic used to prevent magic from passing through and altering the Eidos.

It was unable to prevent the physical effects from magic.

Even if the magic couldn’t directly influence the icicles’ temperature, the heated air would cause the icicles to melt. It was only a matter of time.

(In that case!)

Shizuku stuck her left wrist with the CAD attached into her right sleeve.

She pulled out a pistol-shaped Specialized CAD in her hand.

This was the final trump card that Tatsuya had prepared for Shizuku.

Shizuku pointed the muzzle towards the front row of icicles in Miyuki’s field and pulled the CAD’s trigger.



(Dual-wielding CADs!? Shizuku, you managed to accomplish that?)

Seeing Shizuku’s left hand also holding a pistol-shaped CAD, Miyuki inwardly wavered.

Wielding multiple CADs simultaneously was her brother’s trademark ability. It was an extremely difficult technique that was almost “unique”.

Miyuki believed that, for someone who could so easily lose control of magic like herself, it was far too soon for her to challenge that ability that demanded absolute control of her psions. At the same time, she was terrified of infringing upon her brother’s favored technique.

However, at the current moment, Shizuku was wielding a second CAD before her very eyes.

Without arousing interference from the psion signal waves, the second CAD completed its Activation Sequence.

Instantly, Miyuki’s magic stopped.

The sustained magic was curtailed in mid translation.

Now, Shizuku’s new magic stormed forward.



“Phonon Maser!?”

Hearing Mayumi’s gasp, Tatsuya privately applauded as if this new magic had nothing to do with him: “She certainly is well versed in magic!”

The front row of icicles in Miyuki’s field started to give off white steam.

For three rounds, Miyuki’s icicles were untouched — at the magical level — by her opponents, and were now damaged for the first time by enemy attack.

Oscillation-Systematic Magic “Phonon Maser” — a high level magic that raises the number of supersonic oscillations to form a quantum heat ray.

Even if this was the tactic that Tatsuya gave Shizuku to defeat Miyuki…… His expression remained oddly dark.

Not because Miyuki was in danger of being defeated.

But because he knew better than anyone else that relying on this level of strength to surpass that sister of his was nothing more than a pipe dream.



She faltered for all of one second.

Acting in concert with Shizuku’s newly sustainable magic, Miyuki also switched magics.

The rising steam from the icicles — the sublimation of ice halted.

Not because she blocked the heat ray formed by the shooting supersonic waves, but because an absolute chill that surpassed the heat of “Phonon Maser” had materialized itself.

Miyuki’s field was instantly enshrouded in a sublime, white mist.

The mist gradually drifted towards Shizuku’s field.

Miyuki knew that Shizuku would raise the inference strength on “Data Fortification”.

Despite this. Regardless.

(……Alas, you are too naive, Shizuku!)

The flowing mist was “cold air”. Temperature change — magic that prevented melting had no effect on this magic.

“……‘Niflheim’ ……That’s impossible, right? What magical dimension are we in here……”

Mari said in amazement.

Tatsuya shared that sentiment, but remained silent on the issue.

Wide Area Freezing Magic “Niflheim”.

At the basic level, this technique ignored heat and appearance, using magic to uniformly cool down all the objects within a set area. Even so, in terms of practicality, this magic could be used to create Diamond Dust, Dry Ice Particles, or even large clouds of nitrogen gas in a pinch that could be advanced towards the target.

Likewise, its strength was building towards the strongest level.

The nitrogen mist passed through Shizuku’s field and vanished near the other end of the arena.

On one side of Shizuku’s icicles — the side facing Miyuki that is, nitrogen was coated on its surface, creating “dynamite” on the icicles.

Miyuki disabled “Niflheim” and once again activated “Inferno”.

Shizuku’s “Data Fortification” could only affect objects that originally existed within the area and thus had no impact on newly applied materials.

Lowering the temperature of nitrogen gas produced a cooling effect. Likewise, rapidly heating nitrogen liquid at temperatures far exceeding normal room temperature would instantly evaporate the nitrogen.

Expanding it to 700 times its size.

With a huge roar, Shizuku’s icicles collapsed as one. It was unknown whether the roar came from the icicles hitting the earth or the roar itself caused the icicles to fall, or even if it was caused by the gas explosion.

The very fact that the icicles were shattered into tiny pieces testified to the ferocity of the explosion.

The judges were probably stunned by this scene unfolding before their eyes.

Hence they hesitated briefly before announcing the end of the match.




“Congratulations on your victory, Honoka.”

Shizuku, who had returned to their room first, congratulated Honoka, who was fresh from her post-event medical examination.

“Thank you…… It was a nice try, Shizuku.”

“Yeah…… But I can’t accept it.”

Her soft words would likely prompt some people to suspect: “Is that true?” But Honoka was her close friend from childhood, and there was no way she could misinterpret Shizuku’s meaning.

“Shizuku……”

Honoka wrapped her arms around the slightly shorter Shizuku and pulled her into a hug.

Arms dangling, Shizuku dove into Honoka’s embrace.

“Even though I never thought I had a chance from the beginning.”

“Really……”

“But, there was nothing I could do.”

“…………”

“I still can’t let it go, Honoka……”

“……You gave it your all.”

This persisted for some time.

“……Thanks. I’m OK now.”

Shizuku said as she separated from Honoka.

There were no tear tracks on her face.

“Is that so……? Shizuku, want to grab some tea? I’m a little hungry.”

“……OK.”

“Give me a second to change, alright?”

Shizuku smiled in embarrassment and nodded as she watched Honoka’s sunny attitude.



The moment Honoka stepped into the cafeteria, she was immediately caught between a rock and a hard place and struck immobile.

She locked gazes with Miyuki, who had arrived beforehand.

They couldn’t just retreat like this, but even so, it’s not like they could just nonchalantly sit down next to her. This terrible situation almost caused Honoka to burst into tears.

“Congratulations on your victory, Honoka.”

While Miyuki’s warm smile was no less brilliant than usual, there was still a little stiffness in her upper lip. They were unable to “act normally” and, while there were some degrees of difference, Miyuki was no exception to this either.

“Honoka, congratulations.”

If Honoka hesitated now or put on a stilted smile, this would only worsen the mood. In order to deny her that opportunity, Tatsuya immediately addressed her in his usual tone and simultaneously dispelled the awkward atmosphere around them. However, by doing so he also cut off Honoka’s path of egress.

“Ah, err, thank you very much……”

“Tatsuya-kun, may we sit with you?”

Shizuku broke the ice here.

“Of course, please do.”

Tatsuya said as he rose and stepped behind an empty chair. Miyuki picked up the teacups and moved the tray before sitting down in an adjacent seat from her previous position opposite Tatsuya.

“Please.”

“Thank you.”

Shizuku didn’t hesitate and sat down in the chair Tatsuya pulled out for her — directly across from Miyuki.

Honoka blushed as Tatsuya did the same for her and sat down.

After Honoka and Shizuku ordered a cake set from the waitress that just happened to pass by, Tatsuya once again looked over the two of them.

“This one’s on me. Let’s call this the celebration for taking First and Second Place.”

“Eh, really?”

“……Then, I’ll do just that.”

While Honoka hesitated briefly, Shizuku merely nodded in acceptance. She seemed to comprehend that Tatsuya’s real intention was to console her, so there was no reason to refuse.

Seeing her friend rebound faster than she expected, Honoka breathed a sigh of relief and finally focused her attention on her own situation.

“Um, well……”

“Hm?”

“Well, I was able to win all thanks to Tatsuya-kun! Thank you so much!”

After all the attention was drawn back to herself, Honoka faltered even more than earlier when she realized that she hadn’t thanked Tatsuya for everything yet. She was finally able to deftly do so after great personal difficulty.

Seeing her like this, Tatsuya smiled and nodded his head.

“Just a little.”

He wasn’t being humble nor was he denying her words, he just didn’t want to blow it out of proportion. Honoka didn’t take issue with the words “just a little” probably because she understood the meaning behind his smile.

After verifying this, Tatsuya wiped away his smile and turned his gaze on Shizuku.

“However, I do need to apologize to Shizuku.”

“Eh?”

Shizuku stared at Tatsuya with a “I have no idea what you’re talking about” expression.

“Disregarding the final outcome, this could have turned into a more even contest…… My estimation was too naive. It was too strenuous a demand for you to completely master ‘Phonon Maser’ in two short weeks.”

“Ah, that…… No, that’s not Tatsuya-kun’s fault at all. Also, without that, I would have had no chance to retaliate at all.”

Fully comprehending why Tatsuya was apologizing, Shizuku vigorously shook her head.

“It was my fault I couldn’t control it. I should be the one apologizing. If I could wield it at will, that would have made for a much better match. As an inept opponent, I also extend my apologies to Miyuki as well.”

“Please don’t be like that. At the time, I was very surprised. You were able to use such an advanced magic ability while dual-wielding CADs at the same time.”

Miyuki smiled and shook her head. Afterwards, she teasingly glared at Tatsuya.

“Onii-sama, were you really trying to make me lose?”

At this fairly complex to answer question, Tatsuya immediately responded.

“……I just wanted the both of you to bring out your maximum potential.”

And the result was this dignified but brilliant rejoinder.

Pompous, but it was no lie.

Miyuki knew this very well, but understanding this was one thing, being satisfied with this answer was another thing altogether.

“Seriously…… Does this person not care about his own sister?”

“I do believe you would be truly indignant if I went easy on you.”

Anyone could encounter their friend teasing an older sibling, but this was an extremely rare occurrence for Miyuki. Her words not only brought about Tatsuya’s rebuttal, they also caused Honoka and Shizuku to burst into laughter.




It was the seventh day of the Nine Schools Competition and the fourth day of the Newcomers Division.

Today was the preliminaries of the Newcomers Division Monolith Code event, which was widely regarded as the most important event within the Nine Schools Competition. Yet, the audience’s attention was completely concentrated on Mirage Bat.

Since this was an event that only young ladies participated in, their uniforms consisted of colorful spandex that was covered by flowing miniskirts and sleeveless vests or jackets. When compared to the fashion show (cosplay contest?) that Women’s Icicle Destruction presented, this was another feast for the eyes of a different caliber.

Rather, the young women in these uniforms were dancing through the skies.

In terms of sheer beauty, this event was undoubtedly first among all magic competitions.

Thus, it was perfectly natural to receive massive attention (and scrutiny) from the male fans.

That being said — if this wasn’t Tatsuya’s mental reaction, he felt that he was also the subject of many a curious gaze.

This was no lustful gaze that he was fighting against, but the collective (prickly) hostile gazes filled with enmity.

“……You’re certainly dimwitted when it comes to your own affairs.”

The player that completed her preparations for the first match spoke to Tatsuya in a teasing manner.

“While I don’t deny that I’m a little slow in some regards…… You have some idea, Satomi?”

“Of course!”

She was Satomi Subaru from First High 1st Year Class D, and, of course, a Course 1 student. Satomi was actually her surname, as the two of them were not close enough for Tatsuya to call her by her actual name.

“Everyone came to see Shiba-kun.”

She was a young lady that was somewhat similar to Mari. To be precise, they were both more popular among their own gender than with those of the opposite gender.

However, at the end of the day, they were only “somewhat” similar. Also, if the two of them stood side by side, they would still give off different impressions to others.

Let’s assume both were dressed in swallowtail suits.

Mari would give off a “beautiful lady dressed in men’s clothes” vibe.

While Subaru would definitely categorize as a “beautiful young man from the troupers”.

Regretfully, that was probably their defining difference.

It remained a mystery as to whether Subaru was conscious of this point, but it was true that her tone and mannerisms had a masculine tinge to them.

Even so, this was hardly a “rude” impression, but as her previous words implied, she was an extremely perceptive young lady.

“In both Speed Shooting and the subsequent Icicle Destruction, we seized all three of the top spots. I think anyone watching could see that highly efficient CAD software played an integral part in that. That’s why everyone wants to know who the technician responsible is.”

“……But, anyone can find out who the technician on duty is without much research.”

“That’s true. Shiba-kun, the other schools are now very wary of you.”

If what Subaru said was true — and there was no reason to think otherwise — then things were rapidly progressing in the direction that Tatsuya wanted to see the least.

Generally, people are forced to act in conditions where they are not fully prepared. That’s just “how life works”.

Despite that, he was woefully unprepared for this situation.

According to the plan, “Shiba Tatsuya” was only supposed to be revealed post graduation.

“Then…… It’s my turn to take this by storm. Honestly, with this CAD in hand, there’s no reason I can be defeated in the preliminaries.”

As she paced continuously towards the entrance, Subaru raised her right arm with a “bracelet” that seemed to flash in the sunlight. Over one shoulder, she revealed a daring smile.

Tatsuya gave her a thumbs up and watched her depart.

As she said herself, Subaru was practically guaranteed to triumph in the preliminaries.

Using the CAD he calibrated.

While he didn’t want to be in the public eye so much, he couldn’t exactly just mail it in either.

As a Course 2 student — as a Weed in the system, nobody save for one person placed high expectations on him, but now he was out of options.

Now, he had Mayumi and Mari who nominated him for the Nine Schools Competition, Katsuto who supported this decision, Hattori who backed him despite his own personal feelings and Kirihara who was willing to be a guinea pig despite the danger. Then there were Honoka, Shizuku, and all the other female players who were depending on him as well as — and Miyuki, who unconditionally believed and supported him.

Once entwined, these social links could not be so easily “dissolved”, even by him.




Mirage Bat involved four people at a time in the preliminary round, with the six victors from each round advancing to the next round.

Even though this was the event in the Nine Schools Competition with the least amount of matches, this did not imply that this was an easier task for the players.

Taking into consideration that there were three rounds, each lasting 15 minutes at a time, this was the longest event in the Nine Schools Competition. Including the five minute breaks spaced between, the event could last approximately one hour. Compared to Icicle Destruction and Monolith Code that had no time restrictions, this was an especially long duration.

Also, during the match itself, the players had to use sustainable magic and continuously leap into the air. The stress placed on the players themselves easily rivaled that of a marathon.

And to top it all off, there were two matches in one day alone.

In terms of physical stamina, this was a more punishing event than Crowd Ball or Monolith Code.

With the players’ exhaustion in mind, there was a large interval for resting between the preliminary and elimination rounds, which could be said to be a unique feature of this event.

The first match was set at 8 AM. With two arenas going at the same time, the preliminaries would be finished around noon.

The elimination round would start at 7 PM. This was the only night time event in the entire Nine Schools Competition.

Some may question why the Nine Schools Competition forced the preliminary and elimination rounds into one day rather than splitting them across two days. There was, of course, a method to the madness.

Mirage Bat was an event that involved swinging a bat towards the orb-shaped holograms (Strictly speaking, they were three dimensional orb images. Modern imaging techniques technically possessed fundamental differences with holograms). In other words, the player had to identify the illusion floating ten meters off the ground while still grounded, otherwise there was no way to complete the event. This event was not suited to be conducted under the burning sun. Hence an airship was deployed during the third match to avoid letting the sun interfere with the event.

Mirage Bat was designed to be conducted during night time.

In order to avoid letting the players’ bodies cover the projecting lights, the 3D projector was set atop the cylindrical light towers that surrounded the arena. From this alone, one could fully understand this was intended to be a night event.




After the end of the second match — as expected, both Honoka and Subaru advanced — Tatsuya was headed back to his room to take a quick nap.

The two players had already returned to their rooms and were sound asleep.

In this event, restoring lost stamina was absolutely critical.

As the technician, Tatsuya didn’t need to rest physically, but this was a good opportunity to relax his nerves. He toyed with the idea of using the Sleeping Docks, but elected to yield that to the players first and returned to his room, pulled the curtains, and lay on the bed.

Right now, the third match of Mirage Bat was progressing. He was very fortunate to be assigned the first and second matches. Even though it was only one more hour, this hour had a huge impact on refreshing himself mentally and physically.

He also wished that Miyuki’s Official Division preliminary was early as well, but that was out of his hands. Tatsuya abandoned that thought after taking into account how meaningless that consideration was.

His physical body wasn’t tired, so he didn’t have to force himself to sleep, but allowed his mind to wander.

As he lay on the bed with his eyes closed, Tatsuya thought back to the scene from yesterday morning.

Ichijou Masaki and Kichijouji Shinkurou — while they were of the same age as he was, they were both prodigies that were renowned in the world of magic.

Ichijou Masaki — Three years ago, when the Great Asian Alliance invaded Okinawa, the New Soviet Union also took military action on Sado, where the young man of a mere 13 years volunteered for the front lines and, alongside the current head of the Ichijou Family, Ichijou Tsuyoshi, used “Rupture” to annihilate many enemy soldiers. He was a Magician who possessed live combat experience.

While the scale of the battle was quite small (to this day, the New Soviet Union denies their connection with the militants that invaded Sado), he was awarded the title “the Crimson Prince of the Ichijou Family” for his exploits. (Here, “Crimson” praised him for the fact that “he was bathed in blood and fought to the last” rather than being a derogatory “bloodthirsty” label.)

Kichijouji Shinkurou — A genius Magician that identified the “Cardinal Code”, which had only existed in theory, at age 13. Based on his surname Kichijouji and the “Cardinal Code” he discovered, he was given the title “Cardinal George” and was held to be one of the rising stars behind theoretical Magic Sequences who were known throughout the field.

The fact that both of them registered at the same school in the same cohort was a coincidence that bordered on criminal.

For the two of them to team up during Monolith Code was already an invincible combination, at least for the Newcomers Division.

Morisaki and company deserved to be pitied. Tatsuya viewed things that were not connected to him more mercifully.

If only there was some way to close the gap.

(“Rupture” is a magic that possesses A-Rank destructive power…… Maybe.)

The Ichijou Family’s far-famed ability “Rupture” was a Dispersal-Systematic Magic that vaporized all fluids within the target’s body.

Once the fluids from a biological target were vaporized, the body would tear apart.

For internal combustible machines, once the fuel evaporated, the car would immediately explode. This was also the case for battery liquid. Even if there were no flammable liquids on board, there was still engine oil, lubricants, coolant. There was practically no machine that didn’t use some sort of fluid. Thus, as long as “Rupture” was activated, the Ichijous could destroy any machine at will.

This was the perfect magic for both anti-personnel and anti-armor combat. “Rupture” was designed solely for military use, so naturally it infringed upon the rules for Monolith Code.

(That being said, he is still the next head of house for one of the Ten Master Clans and possesses the proud title “Crimson Prince”, so he wouldn’t just rely on “Rupture” as his trump card…… Speaking of which…)

He shifted his thoughts from two people who signed up for Monolith Code and declared war in front of him to the Monolith Code event itself.

He didn’t have to devote all his energy into creating countermeasures for Third High yet.

Right now, First High’s second match was about to start.

(They already took the first match and the second match is against the lowly Fourth High. Even they can’t screw this up that bad……)

Tatsuya’s eyes remained closed as he surrendered to his drowsiness and drifted off to sleep.




Tatsuya woke up shortly after noon and headed for the competition area, only to find the area covered by a rattled atmosphere.

Scratch that, it was a complete state of panic that enveloped the pavilions.

First High’s pavilion was the center of it all.

“Onii-sama!”

The moment he stepped into the pavilion, Miyuki ran over to him as if this was a predetermined event. Shizuku was right alongside her.

“Miyuki…… Shizuku too, weren’t you two with Erika’s group?”

According to the plan, before Honoka got up — she had to prepare for the finals around 5 PM — Miyuki and Shizuku should have been watching Monolith Code with Erika and the others.

Yet, the two of them were here, which implied that……

“What’s going on? Did something happen during Monolith Code?”

Without waiting for an answer, Tatsuya immediately followed up with another question.

There was no reason to ask if something had occurred, the very mood testified that an incident occurred.

Tatsuya had an inkling that this was likely worse than he had feared.

“Yes, there was an accident, but……”

“Miyuki, that was no accident!”

As Miyuki hesitated to speak, Shizuku forcefully overrode her words as she interrupted.

“That was intentionally overkill. It was blatantly against the rules.”

Although she kept a tight rein on her tone, Shizuku’s eyes betrayed her fury.

“Shizuku…… This is not the best time to make wild accusations. We don’t have proof that Fourth High intentionally did this.”

“Indeed, Kitayama-san.”

Behind them, Mayumi interjected into the conversation.

“It is hard to imagine that this was purely an accident…… Even so, we cannot jump to the conclusion that this was premeditated. If we hurtle suspicions around blindly, some people who do not know any better may assume that’s the truth.”

This may be a little impolite, but that was certainly a worthy argument from the upperclassman leadership.

As he saw Shizuku reflect upon that gentle reprimand, Tatsuya also thought, “The President does have a few tricks up her sleeve”. ……Unfortunately, Mayumi immediately squinted at him from the side.

“……Is there a problem?”

“……You were just thinking something impolite, weren’t you?”

(H-how sharp……!)

Tatsuya faltered slightly at how adeptly she saw through him.

Still, when he stood there, his life experiences belied his actual physical appearance.

“No, I was just thinking, as expected of the Student Council President……”

He wore a mask of honesty and feigned that he was being unjustly suspected in order to carefully gauge her reaction.

“……Is that so?”

While her eyes remained suspicious, Mayumi reined herself in at least. Not only was she unable to find any chinks in Tatsuya’s acting, she also felt this wasn’t the right time to pursue this issue.

“Then, what’s our injury situation?”

“So you realized from the conversation alone that Morisaki-kun and the others are injured……”

Mayumi sighed, her expression had “what a troublesome issue” written all over her face.

“……They are seriously injured. The event was held in an urban setting and they were crushed beneath the rubble from a ruined building that crumbled when the attacks from ‘Battering Ram’ struck.”

“……If used against people in closed environments, the magic ‘Battering Ram’ rates as A-rank in destructive power. This is on a completely different level than the danger encountered during Battle Board and is a blatant violation of the rules.”

The “Battering Ram” that the two were speaking of was also known as “Point Burst”, which was a magic developed through PK research. This magic functions by rewriting the Eidos of the target object and applying a massive Weight-Type Magic on a single point. When used against buildings, the target requirement was usually a wall or the ceiling, or at least a “single surface” that was separated from any pillars and also required a colossal magic capacity as well as high interference strength.

If simply destroying a building was the goal, it was more efficient to use Move-Type Magic and sling a hammer around. In comparison, “Battering Ram” was a highly demanding magic that, besides BS Magicians, was not something that could be casually treated like a toy.

“Agreed…… Even if they were wearing military-use protective equipment, that’s not going to help against tons of rocks and dirt falling on top of you. Thanks to the protective helmets and the observers casting Light Weight Magic in time, disaster was averted…… The three of them have undergone magic healing, but even then this will take two weeks. They are confined to bed for the next three days.”

Still, Mayumi avoided making a judgment on whether the accident was truly intentional and subtly altered the direction of the conversation.

“……It’s more serious than I imagined.”

Tatsuya could sympathize with Mayumi’s stance on not voicing an opinion and thus avoiding the need to pursue the issue.

“Indeed. This may be a little rash, but once I saw the magic healers going, that was a horrible sight.”

Just as she said, this was a somewhat harsh opinion regarding the injured members.

At any rate, the fact that Mayumi faltered so badly was also a clear indication that she was probably not on guard against Tatsuya.

“Wait, I’m still unclear on this point. Were all three in the same building?”

This may not have been a matter Tatsuya needed to worry about, but in Monolith Code, the typical strategy called for either one person on the attack and two on the defense or vice versa. Tatsuya had a hard time figuring out what situation would call for all three members of the team to be struck down by the same attack.

“They immediately suffered a surprise attack once the match was under way. It wasn’t that they couldn’t find anyone before the start signal, but it was that they didn’t have a chance to. Setting aside ‘Battering Ram’ for now, there’s no question that jumping the gun is a clear violation of the rules.”

The one who answered was the fuming Shizuku.

“I see…… In that case, then the board will be busy too.”

“Because they weren’t able to prevent it…… Right?”

Seeing Tatsuya grin evilly, Miyuki tilted her head as she asked in confusion.

Miyuki was too sincere and honest to comprehend Tatsuya’s twisted line of logic.

“This isn’t anything too important. Rather, setting an easily destructible ruin as the starting location was one of the key causes of this accident — we’ll call it an accident for now. The board may elect to scrap Monolith Code from the Newcomers Division altogether.”

“……That’s also true.”

Miyuki nodded in profound agreement to Tatsuya’s reasoning. At this time, Mayumi jumped back in.

“There are indeed calls for a halt to this. However, the ending result is that the preliminaries are still going on for all the schools besides us and Fourth High. The worst case scenario is that our school will be treated as withdrawn from the second round of the preliminaries.”

Hearing Mayumi’s words, it was Tatsuya’s turn to turn his head.

“What do you mean worst case scenario? The players are unable to compete any longer, so aside from withdrawing, I don’t see any other options……”

“On this point, Juumonji-kun is currently negotiating with the board.”

“Really……”

After the commencement of the Nine Schools Competition, changing players was forbidden. In other words, since the other side violated the rules, they were going to request an exception?

Even so, the Monolith Code team members consisted of the 1st Year male students with the top three magic technical scores. Even if they found replacements, victory remained elusive. Rather than looking for replacements, a better option would be an unorthodox request to remove the scores from Monolith Code from the aggregate score. Behind these vague responses, Tatsuya made this consideration.

Naturally, Mayumi had no idea what dark plots were running through Tatsuya’s mind.

“—Tatsuya-kun, I wish to speak with you.”

Mayumi’s voice contained coquettish overtones. She must be thoroughly unnerved by this chain of accidents and was subconsciously looking for something or someone to rely on.

At practically the same time, his sister fixed a burning gaze on Tatsuya. He really wanted to dig a hole and hide as he thought “I didn’t do it, don’t glare at me, why aren’t you glaring at Mayumi?”. But there was no way he would be caught dead saying that.

“Can you come with me for a moment?”

Does this mean she was worried about other people overhearing their private conversation?

The burning gaze doubled in intensity, but Tatsuya feigned ignorance as he followed right behind Mayumi.




Although they were inside the pavilion with a wall separating them from the outside, it was only made of cloth after all. From this perspective, this served as a poor sound barrier.

Yet, this was the realm of magic that reversed the laws of reality. Mayumi slowly built up a magical barrier that prevented their voices from traveling outside.

“Quite the perfect sound barrier.”

“Really……? Hm hm, thank you.”

Mayumi sat down with a slightly embarrassed expression while Tatsuya also pulled up a chair and sat.

“Then, let’s cut to the chase……”

“Very well.”

“…………”

Even though Mayumi claimed time was of the essence, she refrained from speaking. Since the two of them alone would arouse all sorts of problems, Tatsuya finally opened up.

“You suspect that this accident is also related to the previous sabotage incident?”

“……Yes. On that topic, I would like to hear Tatsuya-kun’s opinion. Tatsuya-kun mentioned before that Mari’s incident had a high probability of the CAD being tampered with, right?”

Mayumi finally worked up the courage to ask, to which Tatsuya nodded and replied: “Yes.”

“If they were using the same tactic this time, that would fully explain Fourth High’s actions…… How do you think we should go about proving this?”

“Our only option is to catch them red handed, all other options are not viable.”

“Can’t we…… Borrow Fourth High’s CADs and look them over?”

“This would be fine if traces of the rewritten Activation Sequence remained…… But given the ominous silence from the already disqualified Seventh High, this seems unlikely.”

“Really……”

Mayumi’s gaze dropped down to her ten interlaced fingers on the table top.

Tatsuya watched her pose and considered that he caused her some disappointment here. Mayumi didn’t raise her eyes and continued asking.

“……If this played out according to Tatsuya-kun’s assumptions and our school is the subject of sabotage…… What do you think the motive is? Vengeance? Revenge for the incident in spring?”

So that’s the real item that Mayumi was concerned about, Tatsuya thought.

Tatsuya possessed the intelligence in his hands to dispel this concern. He knew that this situation was not caused by remnants of “Blanche”, the terrorist organization that they shattered, or any related organizations. If he revealed everything that he knew, he would be able to alleviate Mayumi’s anxiety.

Yet, whether revealing everything was truly the best choice, he hesitated briefly over this decision.

“……This is unrelated to the incident in spring.”

Finally, Tatsuya elected to play one card from his hand.

“Eh? What makes you say that?”

Mayumi quickly raised her head and asked back, her voice betraying her hopes and prayers that he had some basis for saying so.

Tatsuya possessed the power to realize that hope. At the same time, he was denied the option of laying everything out on the table.

“The day before commencement…… No, the date had already changed. At any rate, the night before the opening ceremony, several miscreants sought to infiltrate the dorms. There were a total of three, each equipped with firearms.”

“……That’s the first I’ve heard of this!”

“That’s because a gag order has been issued. By pure coincidence, I was on station when this occurred and may have supplied some assistance…… I also have some passing familiarity with their background. The ones who struck at this year’s Nine Schools Competition appear to be a criminal organization out of Hong Kong.”

The classified portions were filled in with a few white lies.

Mayumi didn’t suspect his words at all.

“This time may have been coincidental…… But please refrain from such dangerous behavior in the future.”

“If pressed for an answer, I feel that I’m always getting dragged into things.”

Mayumi gazed suspiciously at Tatsuya shrugging his shoulders. But, as she quickly realized, this wasn’t the time for that.

“OK…… Haven’t you been asked to keep this under wraps? Thank you for telling me.”

“In return, please don’t let this spread.”

“I know. I promise.”

Mayumi raised her right hand as if she were solemnly swearing a vow.

At this perfectly natural yet mischievous action, Tatsuya almost burst into laughter.

“……Even though I know I shouldn’t say this but I still want to say, I feel a lot more relaxed.”

“……Indeed, those words cannot be heard anywhere else.”

“No worries. I only say that in front of Tatsuya.”

Keh, how should he interpret that? Tatsuya agonized over that point.

Don’t tell me that she was linking this back to the “trustworthy little brother” line from several days ago?

As usual, Mayumi’s thought pattern remained a complete mystery to Tatsuya.




“What’s the situation?”

“Just as planned. First High will have to withdraw from Monolith Code.”

Yokohama, China Street, the highest floor in some hotel. Five men were seated around a round table with tea sets in a large room chiefly decorated in red and gold.

On the wall, there were images of a dragon in flight sewn with gold thread.

“Monolith Code is the single most valuable event. Even though the Newcomers Division is only worth half the points from the Official Division, this is still a major blow.”

The men nodded with smiles plastered on their faces. However, their pallor was terrible and every one of their smiles was forced.




Afterwards, Mayumi requested: “In order to avoid panic from spreading throughout the 1st Year female students, I’m counting on your support.” Tatsuya remained in the pavilion…… Except he had no clue how to accomplish this.

He felt that it was the duty of the female upperclassmen to care for the mental status of their female underclassmen.

He deeply regretted his lackadaisical acceptance of this charge, so while he wore an expression that claimed “nothing had happened”, he devoted himself thoroughly to CAD calibration for the upcoming events.

That was all he did, but for some reason, he became surrounded by the 1st Year female players.

This may simply be because Miyuki, who was one of the leaders of the 1st Year female players, stuck to him like glue. Initially, Tatsuya thought this was the case but unfortunately, he was not dull enough to believe this without question.

Their eyes were actually focused entirely on him.

These were not flirtatious looks. He was not narcissistic enough to misinterpret that, nor was he wilted enough to be able to not notice them.

At the same time, he was slightly bemused as to the exact meaning behind them — that was the only area where he was slow in.

Completely besieged by these silent gazes, this was an irritating condition to work under, but it’s not like he could shoo them away either.

He refrained from engaging in conversation not because he was hindered by them. Lacking any other options, he elected to ignore them and adopt his usual procedure of silently continuing his work.

An eternally unchanging appearance.

An eternally enduring object.

He had no idea what value this possessed.

For someone who had always labored under restrictive conditions and was well aware of the intermittent nature of the world like Tatsuya, few things were truly eternal.

Even so, the young ladies quieted down gradually as they watched him work as if nothing had happened. All of this Miyuki beheld with her own eyes as she nodded in place of her brother and revealed a satisfied smile.

The greatest beneficiary from his normalcy — or even feigned normalcy — and its ensuing effect, was actually Honoka.

Initially, after hearing the “incident” surrounding Morisaki and the others, her face had turned completely pale. Yet, after watching Tatsuya plug away and attend the tactical meeting as if nothing had occurred, she gradually settled down as well.

The change was so complete that now Tatsuya was the uneasy one.

“There are no strategic adjustments from the preliminary round. In the end, Mirage Bat is a test of stamina.”

Still, even if he felt uneasy, there was nothing he could do at this point.

The match was about to begin. He was pressed for time at the moment, so he could only table his unease and focus his concentration on the battle ahead.

“Avoid getting into a battle of attrition. The only thing you need to do is calmly make any necessary adjustments.”

Under Tatsuya’s watching gaze, Subaru nodded in an exaggerated fashion.

“Honoka, don’t expend energy on excess techniques. Just as we practiced, there are fakes created from illusion magic that serve to waste your stamina.”

Forewarned, it was Honoka’s turn to nod.

“The only thing the two of you should be thinking is how to release your specialties to the fullest. Don’t worry, know that we already own First and Second place right here.”

At Tatsuya’s daring proclamation of victory, both of them nodded in delight.




While it was the height of summer, the longest days had already passed.

By 7 PM, the sun had long since set and the blue sky had been replaced by the hanging stars.

The surface of the lake reflected the overhanging starlight, causing the entire scene to flash brilliantly.

Among the stars, six young ladies stood on several raised pillars.

The thin uniforms that traced their figures did not include any amazing accessories or designs, but over the shimmering waves, they gave off an almost fey like aura. —That’s why there were a lot of male fans flooding the stands.

Mirage Bat used special bats to strike away at the projections that floated 10 meters above the ground, with the highest total determining the victor.

While they said strike, in reality there was no sense of impact nor did the orbs shatter into pieces.

The reason behind this was because the bats in the players’ hands would interact with the CAD and release a signal at the same location as the projections. Once they overlapped, the orb projections would automatically terminate upon registering the impacting signal and add the score to the striking player’s column.

Winning this event required two skills.

The ability to swiftly leap to the same height as the floating projections.

And the ability to even more hastily locate each and every orb’s location.

Of the two, it was the second that could be easily and unexpectedly overlooked. Since nothing was faster than light, immediately taking off after verifying the projection location was usually the swiftest choice. But — there were a few exceptions.

There were a few milliseconds of delay before the projection materialized in the air. If someone could detect the oscillations of the light waves even an instant earlier, they would be able to move towards the location of the light waves before the orb had even formed.

Honoka was extremely adept at reading light waves – strictly speaking, the subtle changes in the Eidos of the light waves. This gave her a tremendous advantage during the elimination round.

The instant before the red orb materialized, Honoka had already activated her magic.

The other players could only watch helplessly as she seized the initiative.

The next orb materialized.

The color was blue. That color was lit for the longest time, so they were the easiest points to score.

Five players started their Activation Sequences.

The first into the air was Subaru.

Everyone started their Activation Sequence at the same time, but the first two to finish them were the players from First High.

Compared to the players in the event, it was the technicians on the outer perimeter that were furious at this outcome.

Since the difference was so splendidly displayed before their eyes, they were forced to admit the cause was the differences in CAD performance.

Since every school had an upper ceiling in terms of machinery, there was no significant difference in hardware capability.

Thus, the only difference lay in software performance.

In other words, the strength of the technician.

“Damn it! How can he fit such a complicated action into such a tiny Activation Sequence!”

Someone choked out in the back. They were probably using a Kirlian filter (a filter that could bring the psion density and activity into the visible spectrum) to take pictures of Honoka and Subaru activating and processing (from the start of the Activation Sequence to the beginning of the processing phase).

They leaped straight into the air — completely ignoring the effects of gravitational deceleration — towards the projections, stopped at the orbs, then immediately returned along the same axis after scoring the point and landed after expending all inertia.

Throughout this chain of movements, regardless of whether it was Honoka or Subaru, they never manipulated the CAD once. In other words, everything from the player leaping into the sky thanks to the Activation Sequence onward was completely written into the CAD.

The smaller the Activation Sequence, the faster the processing speed.

Likewise, the less Activation Sequences that needed to be processed, the less strain was placed on the player as well.

They were using the minimal Magic Power to accomplish phenomenon rewriting at the fastest possible speed.

“It’s as if we’re up against Taurus Silver himself out here!”

No one knew who made that comment in the ensuing ruckus.



“A-chan, what’s wrong……?”

Azusa turned around to find Mayumi studying her strangely. Studying the wide-eyed, petrified her.

“No…… It’s nothing.”

Seeing Azusa curl into a ball, Mayumi replied with an “Is that so?”, and turned back to observing the contest.

Azusa’s reaction was well within the normal boundaries of her behavior, so there probably wasn’t anything to it.

However, what was different was that something other than her usual embarrassment currently captured her heart.

(……As if, we’re up against “Taurus Silver”?)

Somewhere, someone made that complaint.

Mixed into the middle of all the shrieks of delight and dismay, for some reason these particular words wormed their way into Azusa’s ears.

(That fully manual Activation Sequence adjustment…… Connecting the main systems from the Generalized model to the subsystems of the Specialized model is the current cutting edge research…… The ability to use Loop Cast on Generalized CADs…… “Inferno”…… “Phonon Maser”…… “Niflheim”…… Every one of these are high class magics that have never had their Activation Sequences published……)

For someone who was also aiming to become a Magic Artificer, Azusa started thinking back on each “tour de force” that shocked the crowd time and time again.

(As if? We’re up against Taurus Silver?

No, that…… If it wasn’t Taurus Silver himself, this is simply impossible……)



— I wonder how shocking it would be if he turned out to be a Japanese teenager like us —

Suddenly, his voice rang out through Azusa’s memories.

“……What’s the matter? If you’re not feeling well, go take a break!”
