	Vladivostok, Academy of Sciences of the New Soviet Union, Far Eastern headquarters. In one corner of the building without windows, from a cabin in the shape of a cube with a side of about 3 meters, stood a chair resembling a throne of modern palaces.

	 In this chair sat the official Strategic Class Magician of the New Soviet Union, Igor Andreivitch Bezobrazzoff.

	 Slowly removing the helmet from the top of his face, he shook his head and stood up.

	"The magic, is this" decay "...? Muttered Bezobrazzoff in a room where, beside him, there was no one, and he looked around. In this research building there were no windows. Everything in this building had a high degree of secrecy.

	 For example, the cubic cabin behind Bezobrazzoff was a supercomputer that helped in calculating the magic of the magician placed inside. Roughly speaking, it was a device that, when compared with conventional CAD, helped in the activation of large scale magics. The magician can activate magic of a scale that cannot be reached by them without conscious assistance in the form of calculating all factors and obtaining the optimal activation sequence.

	 Where you can not look, you will see only the walls. But Bezobrazzoff, as if ignoring thick walls, stared east-north-east.

	 To the place where the retreat began after the failed invasion of Japan.

	 If Bezobrazzoff continued his support, there would still be something to change. However, this operation was not really intended to invade Japan. It was necessary for ordinary soldiers to release steam.

	 The recently concluded major conflict with the Grand Asian Alliance of Japan does not have the resources to retaliate. On this, in fact, this strategy is calculated.

	"Well, this premonition did not fail us ..."

	 Although it was not yet determined, but as far as he could see, in the pursuit of the Japanese army there was no desire to continue the pursuit to Karafuto.

	 What he did not expect was the existence of a magician capable of annihilating his magic.

	"Who the hell is ...? Maybe the same one, transforming the mass into energy, the Strategic Class Magician who destroyed the fleet of the Great Asian Alliance ...?"

	 Mentally muttered Bezobrazzoff, talking to himself. The first guess he came very close to the truth.





	CHAPTER FIVE





	Sunday, April 14th. Today is the day of the meeting of the young representatives of 28 houses organized by Katsuto, but Tatsuya, as usual, went first to training in the Yakumo temple. The meeting of the Ten Master Clans was not for Tatsuya something that would make the daily routine change.

	 However, if we say that today it was not different from the usual, it is also not true. Yesterday's confrontation with the supposedly Strategic Class Magician, Bezobrazzoff, left Tatsuya very concerned.

	 Tatsuya could not interrupt the magic supposedly being a Tuman Bomba with the help of Gram Dispersion.

	 Yesterday he himself canceled his Gram Dispersion, but without a doubt, if the confrontation is serious, canceling that magic will be a difficult task.

	 It was a first of a kind experience for Tatsuya. He cannot use such powerful defensive magic as Katsuto or Minami. If you need to protect someone but yourself, then destroy the enemy magic. This is his style.

	 How to resist this magic, in which the magic sequence automatically self-replicated, spreading in different directions? What can he do?

	 These were his unconscious thoughts, in which he now plunged.

	 It was very unusual for Tatsuya to get distracted from what he had before his eyes.

	 As expected, during the sparring with Yakumo, he did not have time to distract himself. But, returning home, he completely relaxed.

	 Even taking a shower to wash away sweat, even wiping the body, his mind was completely occupied with the question "How to resist yesterday's magic." To the extent that before him there was no noise and signs of the presence of other people, which he usually notices even without consciousness.

	"If it was a single sequence of magic, then no matter what scale it had, Gram Dispersion could cope with it."

	"If the content was the same, it does not matter how many hundreds, how many thousands of magic sequences, they could be treated as one object."

	"But yesterday's magic was a collection of magic sequences that differed from each other by small shifts in the values of the variables."

	"Regardless of the fact that only the values of coordinates / positions change, it is impossible to process the information as the same, because of the shift in activation time."

	"Magic that spreads through a chain, thanks to this self-replicating ... Hmm, should I call it the" Chain call "? At the moment I do not even know what to do when the Chain call is completely over."

	"Destroy the starting sequence of magic before the spread begins, it's most effective, but ..."

	"... This will not be so easy, the enemy must also have countermeasures for such a case."

	"Each of those magic sequences in itself was not very strong, although the area of damage can be very large, but there were no places that could be called an epicenter with increased temperature or pressure. like a gas bomb. "

	"Then barrier magic with a large output power, undoubtedly, will be able to resist this."

	"So, from the very beginning, is the problem that I cannot use barrier magic at the right level?"

	 "To program Ancient barrier magic? No ... Ancient analysis already has progress, but it's not enough to be used in real combat."

	 "Can Pixie learn barrier magic?"

	 "It's impossible to keep Minami nearby ..."

	These are just about thoughts now intertwined in his mind.

	Suddenly, the bathroom door opened. As expected, no matter how much he was absorbed in his thoughts, he noticed this sound. When Tatsuya's wiping head turned, he saw through the opening in the towel that Minami was standing behind the open door, staring in a stupor and with wide eyes.

	Tatsuya was also surprised. However, he immediately recovered from the shock. After he finished taking a shower, in unconscious action, which could be called good manners, he wrapped the towel around the lower part of the body, hiding some important parts. So now only the upper part of the body was exposed.

	- Minami.

	He spoke as calmly as he could without meeting Minami's eyes.

	But there was no answer. It was impossible to say that Tatsuya could not see her. Because Minami's face was now boiling bright red.



	 "Minami, close the door."

	 This time he spoke in a more harsh tone.

	 - ......!

	 With a delay of a few seconds,

	 - I-, and-, I'm sorry-e!

	 Minami screamed loudly and slammed the door to the bathroom. After that, there was a loud sound, it seems, Minami fell in the corridor. With a bad premonition, Tatsuya quickly put on his clothes.

	 Cooked breakfast was waiting in the dining room on the table. And on the floor, in a formal pose on her knees and in a deep bow to the floor, trembling, sat Minami.

	 Tatsuya glanced at the already occupied Miyuki. Miyuki shook her head with a face saying "I do not understand anything." Minami's Dogeza it seems, was not caused by Miyuki's anger.

	 - Minami. Do not worry about it.

	 - This is not the case! To see the body of Tatsuya-sama, to someone other than Miyuki-sama ... this is unworthy for a maid's rudeness!

	 "Except ... What ...?" - Maimi's muttering did not reach Minami's ears.

	 - Anything, but give me a punishment!

	 "No ... I did not lock the door, so you do not have to blame yourself."

	 - No! It's 100 percent my fault that I did not notice that Tatsuya-sama is in the bathroom! So this useless maid should receive the appropriate punishment!

	 - Punishment, then.

	 It seems that a switch has worked in Minami's mind. Puzzled, Tatsuya looked at Miyuki with a look of prayer for help.

	 - Minami-chan, it's all so similar to a love story with a story about modern Europe ...

	 With a bitter smile, Miyuki gave Tatsuya advice (?).

	 Indeed, this was advice. Thanks to him, Tatsuya's former doubts have disappeared. But, unfortunately, the issue was not solved yet.

	 "Nothing can be done," Tatsuya thought. Do not blame Minami, this can be a problem for future plans. Tatsuya decided to briefly turn into a demon, discarding pity.

	 "... Minami, I must go to an important meeting soon." You know this.

	 - ... Yes. - Minami answered loudly, without raising her forehead from the floor.

	 - After the meeting, we must go to the main house. Naturally, you will have to go with us, as Miyuki's guard.

	 - I know about it.

	 - So, today is full of cases. We do not have time for your punishment. Do you understand what I mean?

	 - ... Yes.

	 "Then, get up." First, finish breakfast, and then do your usual business. I think if you get any punishment, then you cannot do your job.

	 - ... I am obeying.

	 With a confused face, Minami sat down at the table. Recalling his own mistakes, Tatsuya was seized with a strong sense of guilt.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	 This morning's incident dealt a strong blow to Tatsuya's morale, but at the same time allowed him to distract and take away to the distant regiment of reason thinking over the measures against the Chain call. Tatsuya's mood changed when, at the entrance to the Bay Hills Tower of Yokohama, where the branch office of the Kanto Magic Association is located, he accidentally noticed well-known three sisters to him.

	 They also noticed Tatsuya, and the first conversation was started by one of them.

	 - Ara, Tatsuya-kun. Long time no see.

	 Mayumi, in a bright colorful suit, not suitable for the role of dresses for formal events, waved to him. This behavior did not fit the image of the "adult woman", created by a tight suit, emphasizing an elegant and slender figure.

	 However, it could also be said that this is just like Mayumi.

	 - Long time no see. Saegusa-sempai will also attend the meeting?

	 Tatsuya thought that the elder son, Tomokazu, would be present from the Saegusa family at today's meeting. But the number of participants was not limited. Although if you are five or ten men, many will probably be shocked, but bringing 2-3 people was a sensible decision.

	 - No. We are here for help.

	 However, Tatsuya was mistaken. It seems that not only Mayumi, but Kasumi and Izumi dressed up in more adult clothes to help administrators and guides.

	 "But why exactly, senpai?" I thought that today's meeting is organized by the Juumonji family.

	 The Tatsuya question was only a superficial check.

	 - Today's meeting of Juumonji-kun was offered by our brother, so it's quite natural for us to help.

	 However, Mayumi easily revealed hidden facts.

	 - ... This is normal? To reveal such things.

	- Is that a problem? After all, our father did not stop us when we went to help.

	 If a non-participant in the meeting Mayumi and her sisters appear here as organizers, then there must be fears that various hidden circumstances may be revealed by various interrogations. Since she recognized this, it means their logic was that they do not mind it.

	 - I think this conclusion is too reckless, but ...

	 Although Tatsuya almost understood that there are some disagreements between Mayumi and the head of the Saegusa family, Koichi, he felt that it was not like Mayumi. Despite feelings for her father, she should take care of the interests of the Saegusa family.

	 "Sempai, do you not like the fact that Juumonji-senpai was used?"

	 Tatsuya's unexpected assumption, Kasumi and Izumi made surprised faces simultaneously.

	 - T-this just cannot be! This has nothing to do!

	 The language of Mayumi did not depend on Tatsuya's question, but rather on the sight of the rounded eyes of younger sisters. Tatsuya was also surprised by this panic that arose from his question.

	 - ......

	 "What a look!" Juumonji-kun and I are not in such a relationship!

	 - ... I did not mean it, but ...

	 - What, "but" !? This is really not true!

	 She did not look so uptight, but Tatsuya decided not to say too much.

	 "Sempai, we attract attention."

	 This advice fell into the category of "unnecessary" rather than "superfluous".

	 Not knowing what to say to this, Mayumi froze, without speech.

	 - Then, I'll go. I know where to go.

	 "It's not necessary to show the way," he had in mind. Then he turned and walked to the elevator.

	 To no longer create problems for Mayumi, Tatsuya decided to go to the floor of the meeting.





	 The meeting is scheduled for 9:00 in the morning. Up to this time, there were still 20 minutes. But before the conference hall a lot of magicians had already gathered. The entrance was already open, but it looks like there were a lot of people trying to collect information in advance, in conversations, without taking up space.

	 Among them, Tatsuya found a man in a familiar school uniform.

	 - Shippou.

	 - Ah, Shiba-senpai.

	 The person in the form of First High was none other than a pupil a year younger, Shippou Takuma. He himself would never admit this, but he did not look at ease in the group of adults he was not familiar with. Hearing Tatsuya's voice, he walked towards him with relief on his face.

	 "Why do not you go inside?" "Missing the greeting," Tatsuya asked. He did not ask "Are you involved?".

	 He knew that Takuma was the only child in the family, without even looking at his personal data provided to the school. Despite the fact that early weddings are encouraged among magicians, they are not forced to have many children. They're not breeding livestock. No one will be forced to be healed unless they can give birth to a second.

	 Since Takuma is the only child, it was quite obvious to Tatsuya that he would come to the meeting as a representative of the Shippou family.

	Takuma, it seems, also saw that Tatsuya, having appeared in this place, does not feel any discomfort, but in his case it was possible to say that he could not afford it.

	 "It seems that you can already go in, but apparently the places are not yet distributed ..." Takuma replied to Tatsuya's question, not hiding his nervousness. In other words, he did not seem to know where to sit.

	 - Let's go together?

	 - Thank you!

	 "And he is pretty straightforward," Tomitsuka would have thought, if he were here. But Tatsuya did not feel any particular change in his mood towards Takuma. Tatsuya entered the conference room, leading Takuma behind him, just like his kohai from school.





	 In the conference hall, a square with a void in the middle was drawn from long tables.

	 Each side had 6 seats. In addition to the one with which there were 5 seats, because the total number of participants was 23.

	 Tatsuya sat in the right row. In particular, he did not realize where the "leading" and "lower" places are. He chose this place, simply because his friend was there.

	 - Ichijou, long time no see.

	 - Only a month has passed. - At Tatsuya's greeting, Masaki wearing the uniform of Third High, answered with a slightly upset expression. Remembering what he had experienced, he had a feeling that he did not know what kind of person to actually do instead. - Are you alone?

	 "One is enough."

	 Tatsuya answered this question with a serious face. Of course, Masaki hoped that Miyuki would come, but apparently realizing that Tatsuya would not take her to such a place, he did not show much disappointment.

	 - By the way, Ichijou. - Tatsuya leaned toward Masaki and lowered his voice. - How is your father's health?

	Takuma did not seem to have heard this question. Masaki reflexively frowned, but realized that Tatsuya was worried.

	"... He's much better now." Shiba, I must say thank you.

	Masaki's gratitude was that Yotsuba's family sent to them to Yuka. Tatsuya immediately realized this, and did not joke with phrases like "what for?".

	- We are all equal before one disaster, the family only found a specialist. We understand your feelings.

	Tatsuya did not forget to hide Yuka's connection with the Yotsuba.

	- It's clear.

	Masaki decided that it would be rude to add something else to this topic. He bowed slightly and fell silent. Tatsuya also straightened up.

	Seeing that the greetings of these two were over, Takuma stood up and spoke with Masaki.

	- Ichijou-san. My name is Shippou Takuma. It's a pity we did not have the opportunity to speak last month, when you attended First High . Nice to meet you.

	 - Ichijou Masaki. It is mutual.

	 Masaki responded laconically and bowed, preserving the image of the older man.

	 Last year's Takuma might have become angry with Masaki's behavior. But the current Takuma took it as something self-evident. On the contrary, Takuma, most likely, was aware of some similarity to Masaki.

	 - Ichijou-san is also in school uniform ...

	 Feeling this similarity, these were just words to support the conversation.

	 - The school uniform is for formal events.

	 Masaki briefly expressed his thoughts, as if to say "this is natural," from which Tatsuya's face was involuntarily raised with a bitter grin.





	Almost five minutes before the scheduled time of the beginning of the meeting, almost all the seats were already occupied. There were still people talking in the corridor, so, no doubt, most of the planned participants should be here. In this "majority" one person was not included. The minute hand managed to make three turns before this woman finally entered the conference hall, undoubtedly, attracting a lot of attention.

	 The height was too tall for a woman. The features of the face under the short brown hair, although not masculine, but also cannot be called feminine. Although the figure, dressed in a jacket and trousers, clearly shouted that it was a "woman."

	 Age - 29 years. Probably the oldest at this meeting.

	 - Shiba Tatsuya-kun. Hmm, or Yotsuba Tatsuya-kun?

	 - Shiba Tatsuya. This is our first direct conversation. Nice to meet you, Mutsuzuka-san.

	 - Nice to meet you. As you said, I am Mutsuzuka Atsuko.

	 Mutsuzuka Atsuko, who entered the conference hall, the head of the Mutsuzuka family of the Ten Master Clans, spoke to Tatsuya for some reason. The fact that Mutsuzuka Atsuko admires Yotsuba Maya was widely known among the 28 houses. It seems that she first approached Tatsuya and spoke, because he was the son of Yotsuba Maya. Although in fact he is a nephew, but even if it were officially announced in this way, Atsuko would probably still choose Tatsuya as the first person to meet at this meeting.

	 - Mutsuzuka-san, we have not seen each other for a long time.

	 Following Tatsuya's example, Masaki stood up and spoke to Atsuko. Masaki, involved almost since birth in the Ten Master Clans was familiar with Atsuko.

	 "I have not seen you for a long time, Masaki-kun." By the way ...

	 - Already almost recovered.

	 Understanding with a half-word, what Atsuko wants to ask, Masaki immediately answered.

	 - Here's how? This is good.

	 After that, standing up simultaneously with Masaki, Takuma also said his first meeting greetings.

	 The Shippou family became part of the Ten Master Clans in February this year. Since the head of the Shippou family, Shippou Takumi hardly ever communicated with families that did not have "seven" and "three" in their surnames. So Takuma had little information about those of the 28 families that lived outside of Kanto.

	Atsuko responded in a friendly tone to the present Takuma and went to her place. It seems that her place was pre-appointed at the head of the table, next to Katsuto and Tomokazu.

	At exactly 9 am, Katsuto and Tomokazu entered the conference room simultaneously.

	Thus, all the seats were occupied.

	Katsuto expressed his gratitude to all those present for coming here and taking his place at the main table.

	"You all came here, despite your busy schedule." Therefore, I would like to go straight to the matter, without wasting time.

	There were no objections. Most of the participants in this meeting were more than 20 years old. There were only four younger than 20: Katsuto, Tatsuya, Masaki and Takuma. Therefore, here there was no deep-seated need like in the pupils of junior and secondary schools for things like "let's first introduce each other."

	- What I would like to discuss today is the question that we, magicians, should oppose to the intensifying anti-magic movement. This month, major incidents occurred not only in Japan, but throughout the world. Although it was not officially reported, but I heard that there were cases when the problem flowed into a mutiny or civil war. How should we act in such a harsh situation? I would like to get a lot of frank opinions.

	Waiting until Katsuto finished his speech, Masaki raised his hand.

	 - I'm Ichijou Masaki. "Masaki said, making sure that Katsuto nodded. - Before expressing my opinion, I would like to confirm the nature of this meeting. Despite the fact that confrontation with anti-magic activists is an important issue, but is the established restriction in 30 years an attempt to exclude most heads of families?

	Almost half of the participants nodded after Masaki's question. Katsuto looked from Masaki to Tomokazu. Thus, people sitting at the table realized that this meeting was really organized by the Saegusa family, and not by Juumonji. For the majority of those present, this was not a surprise.

	Without fearing the incredulous looks of twenty people, Tomokazu stood up. Those who did not shoot glances at him with were: Tomokazu himself, Katsuto, and also Tatsuya.

	 - I'm Saegusa Tomokazu. In truth, the organization of this meeting came to our mind when Juumonji-san and I discussed measures to counter the movement advocating a magician boycott. Therefore, I believe that Ichijou-san's question will be answered better.

	 Tomokazu looked around everyone. It was not wishing to interfere. The atmosphere prevailed in the hall was the desire to hear what Tomokazu would say now.

	 - Measures against radical strengthening of the movement against magicians were also discussed at the Master Clans Conference, which became the target of the terrorist attack of anti-magic activists. However, as I heard, the result was only passive measures to increase surveillance.

	 Tomokazu paused. There were two people present at the Master Clans Conference, Atsuko and Katsuto.

	 - It was so. Atsuko confirmed Tomokazu's words even before her eyes met her. Tomokazu bowed slightly to Atsuko and continued the explanation.

	 - However, there are limits to what we just silently observe. During the search for terrorists, I fully realized this.

	 - Wait a bit. Suddenly, someone's voice interrupted Tomokazu's speech.

	 - I'm sorry. My name is Kudo Soshi from the Kudo family. I apologize for interrupting your speech, but what about the search for terrorists? I'm ashamed to say, but I have not heard any mention of the Ten Master Clans taking part in the search for terrorists in the Hakone incident.

	 After the words of Soshi, representatives of the Eighteen Substituting Families heard approval voices.

	 - The police announced that the investigation is ongoing, and the terrorist incident of Hakone has not yet been resolved. It is not true? If the Ten Master Clans seized on a decision, why did not they tell us about it?

	"What does he want?" , Tatsuya thought silently, listening to Soshi's protest.

	 Until February, the Kudo family was one of the Ten Master Clans. Then, having closed the problems of the Saegusa family, more precisely by wedging into the personal quarrel between Yotsuba Maya and Saegusa Koichi, they were demoted to the status of the Eighteen Assistant Houses.

	 Having the pride of those who have long maintained the status of one of the Ten Clan Clans, they cannot accept the fact that they are out of work.

	 Tatsuya wondered how difficult it must be for Minoru to have such a family.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Immediately after the beginning of the meeting, the turmoil on the first floor of the Bay Hills Tower of Yokohama subsided. With the appearance of a young man with beauty, as if not from this world, not only women, but even men, forgot about restraint and good manners.

	 Seeing these impolite looks, the young man frowned. But even this discontented person did not help get rid of annoying looks.

	 "Ara, is not that Minoru-kun?"

	 Frustrated by this depressing attention, Minoru, recognizing the owner of this voice, finally relaxed his tense face.

	 - Mayumi-san. And also Kasumi-san and Izumi-san.

	 Minoru and three beautiful girls approached each other. And then the surrounding depressive atmosphere dissipated. Men, looking at the beauty of Minoru, and women, combating the attractiveness of each of the three sisters, could not help surrendering.

	 "Long time no see, Minoru-kun."

	 - Yes, Minoru and I have not seen each other since the Thesis Competition ... half a year ago?

	 Izumi, you can tell, we saw Minoru in the middle of February, but it was through the videophone's communication line during communication between the school boards. But as Kasumi said, we last spoke with Minoru behind the scenes of the Stage of the Thesis Competition in Kyoto, where she came to support her.

	 Minoru, being the same age as Kasumi and Izumi, has crossed with them since quite a long time, although this has not happened so often. These two, not frightened by Minoru's beauty, were one of his few friends.

	 "By the way, Minoru-kun." If you are to meet, do you know that it has already begun?

	 - The meeting is entrusted to Soshi-nisan. - Answered Minoru to Mayumi's question.

	 "Err?" I think Minoru would have been better suited.

	 - Hey! Kasumi-chan. Tsyts.

	 Mayumi excitedly reproached Kasumi for her unrestrained thoughts. However, she also did not deny the very content of the words of the younger sister. Minoru, unable to comment on this, could only show a bitter smile on his face.

	 - Onee-sama. Since we're talking, maybe we'll go elsewhere? It seems that there are no latecomers, therefore, I think we do not need to remain here as guides. - Having picked up a good time, Izumi intervened in the conversation.

	 - Exactly. Let's go somewhere where you can sit down?

	 Mayumi, too, having understood the idea of her younger sister, immediately went somewhere. Minoru realized that this was a kind of care for his mental state due to poor health, so he, without resistance, obediently followed Mayumi.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	 "We did not notify you of the facts of the Hakone incident, because it ended with a bad result." You can call this a shame.

	 Those who answered Kudo Soshi's question were Katsuto.

	 - Under a bad result, do you mean that the terrorists managed to escape?

	 Despite his discouraged look under the powerful voice of Katsuto, Soshi found the strength to continue asking.

	 - The leader of the terrorists is undoubtedly dead.

	 - But then what's the problem ...

	 - However, we could not get the corpse of this leader.

	 From these words of Katsuto, Masaki clenched his teeth almost to the point of grinding. And Tatsuya listened to this as if it did not concern him.

	 - The ship carrying the terrorists was sunk by the intervening USNA army.

	 - The USNA Army intervened ...?

	 From unexpected details provided by Katsuto, Soshi hesitated and could no longer speak.

	 - The attack of the USNA army hit the body of the terrorist leader with a direct blow in such a way that nothing remained from the corpse.

	 Katsuto personally did not confirm the death of Gu Jie, responsible for the terrorist attack in Hakone. However, here and now, honestly this claim was not necessary.

	 "We cannot prove that the terrorist leader is dead, if we do not show him the corpse." It is impossible to declare an incident resolved without material evidence.

	 - ... Now the reason why the police are still investigating is understandable.

	Soshi finally reconsidered his attitude.

	- And yet, was it necessary to keep this a secret from us?

	There was no longer any zeal in his voice. The sharp tone disappeared.

	"We did not plan to keep it a secret." I admit that we did not pay enough attention to this, so why do not we discuss this another time?

	Tomokazu's instant response reflected Soshi's protest.

	Intervention by Soshi interrupted the answer to Masaki's question. If he continues in the same spirit, he can be perceived as interfering with the answer to this question. The atmosphere "we are tired of it" began to form in this room.

	- I understood. But please let us know this important information as soon as possible.

	- Everything will be in the best possible way.

	Tomokazu responded with ease to the words of the defeated Soshi. Soshi, feeling humiliated, clasped his hands tightly. However, Tomokazu, ignoring this (or ignoring), looked around the conference room.

	 - The problem is not limited to terrorists. It is simply necessary to co-operate with people living in this society in order to search for hidden elements in society. However, our investigation failed to enlist the help of civilians.

	 At this moment, Tatsuya first showed interest in the speech of Tomokazu. He and Masaki just pursued Gu Jie from the very beginning. However, Tomokazu, more precisely the Saegusa family, tried to collect information from local residents.

	 When conducting an investigation of this kind, it is best to use the police for this. But then why did the Saegusa family decide to pretend to be inexperienced with the police? Perhaps the Saegusa family does not control itself from within?

	 Tatsuya thought that all these thoughts are useless at the moment and have nothing to do with anything.

	 "But not all the locals were hostile to magicians." There were some who really understand us. And people with this attitude are not few.

	 - Really?

	The voice of one of the participants, interrupting this speech, seemed unintentional.

	 - I apologize. My name is Itsuwa Hirofumi from the Itsuwa family.

	 Being for some time the candidate for Mayumi's groom, Hirofumi, undoubtedly, was familiar with Tomokazu. He introduced himself to the other participants in the meeting to observe the rules of decency.

	 - If this is true, what is the meaning of all this?

	 Hirofumi raised this question with doubt, because even for the Ten Master Clans this was first time it's been told.

	 - I think that people who sympathize with magicians are frightened.

	 - Are frightened by the cruelty of those who are against magicians?

	 - Right. I do not think that anti-magic activists make up the majority of the population. But their activities are very visible. Therefore, people are afraid that they will become targets of this reckless cruelty, if they openly show sympathy for magicians ... That's my opinion.

	 The same logic came to mind for many of those present now, so there was no objection.

	 - I believe that anti-magic activists are a noisy minority, while a quiet majority sympathizes or at least slightly sympathizes with magicians. However, in fact, we could not fulfill the goal of capturing terrorists because of their oppression, we did not receive support from the population.

	 - Excuse me. I am Yatsushiro Takara. - This time Tomokazu was interrupted by the younger brother of the head of the family Yatsushiro from the Ten Master Clans. "Even if the civilians cooperated, this would not guarantee the capture of terrorists."

	 - Of course, that's true. But the reverse is also true: having received help from the population, we, probably, would find out much more quickly where the terrorists hid. Then, perhaps, such an outcome would not have happened, where there was not even a corpse left.

	 - These are already assumptions.

	 - It's about the fact that it was possible.

	 Yatsushiro Takara bowed and sat down. Having received a refutation, he considered that it was not worthwhile to get involved in an endless war in which he had no arguments.

	 "So I believe that those sympathetic to magicians are in a position where they cannot say anything in fear of those who are hostile to magicians."

	 Pausing and carefully selecting the words, Tomokazu continued, softening the tone.

	 "However, I understand that this is my personal impression, so I want you all to think about it." We thought about the fact that the strength of opponents of magicians is growing, while the supporters of magicians do not give a vote, and we, the magicians, passively watch it.

	 - I apologize, but is it not too radical a judgment that there is no help from the supporters of magicians? - Mutsuzuka Atsuko inserted her remark. None of the present did not complain that she did not introduce herself. Atsuko is the head of the Mutsuzuka family of the Ten Master Clans. Naturally, all those present knew the names and faces of the heads of the Ten Master Clans.

	 - In fact, there are even politicians who protect magicians. As far as I know, Congressman Ueno closely interacts with the Saegusa family.

	 - Right. As you say. "Tomokazu understood that it was useless to deny, and he directly acknowledged Atsuko's point of view. "However, it is also an indisputable fact that his voice is insignificant, and he is under the constant pressure of the opposition.

	 - You are right, of course. But what is the connection between this and the fact that this meeting has an age limit of up to 30 years?

	 Atsuko returned to the initial question, arguing that the conversation had deviated from the topic. As if he was ready for this, Tomokazu did not seem to be puzzled by Atsuko's sudden question.

	 - The opinion of the head of the family leads directly to the actions. Therefore, negotiations between heads of families will be too cautious. Is it not?

	- ... Of course, there is such a tendency.

	 "So we thought, if a young generation with a free point of view shared their thoughts with each other, then some wise decision could be born."

	 - This meeting is not something where something will be decided. - Choosing the right time, before listening to Katsuto silently began to speak.

	 - Although I am the head of the family Juumonji, but until now I cannot solve the family's affairs alone. Even if we come to an agreement here, it will still be impossible to apply this in practice. However, the exchange of views here will not be completely meaningless.

	 "In other words, this meeting is the place where the ideal solution is sought, what to do with the anti-magic movement?"

	 - I think that you exaggerate the concept of "ideal" a bit.

	 Katsuto shook his head with a bitter smile, not showing a drop of dislike of the question Takara had asked.

	 "So if we can come up with a plan here and come to some sort of agreement, then we'll take it up for discussion at the next Master Clans Conference."

	 It seems that Takara convinced that. From the side of Masaki, Hirofumi, Soshi and Atsuko, there were no objections either.

	 Only Tatsuya felt the inconsistency here. It consisted in the fact that Katsuto, saying that nothing was being decided, after that he said that it was necessary to come to a "general agreement". For the further development of events at the meeting, he decided to follow with caution.

	 Mayumi led Minoru to the tea room of the Magic Association. The choice was made on the grounds that they (especially Minoru) would cause confusion by coming to a regular fast food restaurant.

	 Kasumi, Izumi, and especially Minoru, did not even think of complaining about it. Comparing the taste and variety of available things, the tea room was inferior to cafes and restaurants. However, these annoying views, under which one must maintain self-control, far outweighed the scales.

	 Stopping the tea room employee, Mayumi chose the tea leaves herself, took the kettle and made the black tea.

	 Despite the fact that this tea room was paid for, and everyone could do for them, no one complained, because everyone in this room knew about Mayumi's passion for tea ceremonies. The employees of the branch and the tea room were also aware of the selfish nature of Mayumi. Moreover, all the employees of the tea room to one were acquaintances of her.

	 - Here, I ask.

	 - Thank you.

	 Mayumi placed a cup of tea in front of Minoru, which he bowed with gratitude.

	 Even behaving like an "ordinary boy", Minoru looked like he had descended from a masterpiece-painting. After the actions of Mayumi, the female employee who brought the cakes and biscuits to the tea (it was all paid for in advance), froze next to the table.

	 With a bitter smile showing that "there's nothing you can do about it," Kasumi (by force) snatched a basket of cookies and a plate of cakes from her hand.

	 - However, it's unusual to see Minoru-kun here. - Remained alone, not in business Izumi spoke with Minoru.

	 - Probably, it will be correct to call it ... by the escort of Soshi-nisan.

	 Although Izumi only wanted to support a simple secular conversation, but Minoru's answer was evasive and made little sense.

	 - Do you have an assignment?

	 - The task...? Hoping for the skin of a bear ...

	Minoru was answered by Izumi, shortening the saying "to share the skin of an unfortunate bear." [In the Japanese original there is another, but about the bear - the closest in meaning, though it sounds silly.]

	 - ... And can you hear the details?

	 Somehow sensing in the eyes of the guy an inexorable craving for "someone to pour complaints", Izumi with her question as if she said "go ahead, do it."

	 "In short, I'm required to meet with Shiba Tatsuya-san and Miyuki-san to strengthen our friendship." Of course, I was disappointed when I found out that it would not be a visit to their house.

	 - Uwaa ... Onii-san Minoru does not change at all.

	 - Hey, Kasumi-chan!

	 - Everything is fine.

	 Mayumi again commented on Kasumi, but Minoru shook his head with a smile.

	 "I also think that the approach of san and nye-san is rather naive."

	 - In other words, do they want to establish friendly relations with the Yotsuba family through Minoru-kun? - Closing the subject of Minoru's domestic family affairs, Izumi shifted the conversation to the subject of speculation of the Kudo family.

	- It is probably so. - Minoru also realized that her words did not carry malicious intent towards his brothers and sisters, and sent a grateful look at Izumi.

	"I do not think I'll be mistaken if I say that the Kudo family does this for the sake of returning to the Ten Master Clans."

	Here, Izumi did not blush and lost her speech, because she was accustomed to the fact that she always drills Miyuki with her gaze.

	- But unfortunately. Very sorry!

	From the sudden, energetic voice of Izumi, Minoru's eyes widened. "What does that mean," he asked Mayumi. She only smiled bitterly in reply.

	- Only Shiba-senpai came to today's meeting.

	"And when Izumi was told by Shiba-senpai, she meant ony-san, that is, the groom. - Kasumi added a remark to avoid confusion. Izumi did not care that she was interrupted. Or maybe she did not hear.

	- Miyuki-senpai can still appear after noon.

	Izumi, the worshiper of Miyuki, as a goddess, tried to use words with double politeness. [Feature of the Japanese language. For example, saying that Miyuki can appear, she uses the expression "to go out," meaning the appearance of famous people in public.]

	- I was so waiting for a meeting in a place where there will be no Shiba-senpai! I would never have come to this place, knowing that Miyuki-senpai does not even plan to come!

	Thinking about something, Izumi reached for the handkerchief.

	"... Did not you say that you can only see each other in the morning?"

	 - What are you saying, Kasumi-chan! Is it possible to disturb Miyuki-sempai, undoubtedly, now busy preparing for the exit!

	- ... Ah, that's it.

	Minoru looked away from the overexcited Izumi. Mayumi could only watch Izumi, and on her face was an expression showing a headache.

	- Em, Izumi-san ...

	Minoru could not continue to talk, not understanding what could happen.

	- Do not pay attention. This is a kind of small delirious fit.

	- Ha ...

	With pity in her voice, Mayumi answered an unasked question to Minoru, showing that she was already used to it.

	"Moreover, Minoru-kun."

	 - Yes?

	 "Do you want to visit us at home?" I do not know how valuable this is compared to the Yotsuba family, but maybe your brothers will not complain if instead you tell me that you have strengthened your old friendship with the Saegusa family.

	 Minoru was touched by Mayumi's proposal. Indeed, instead of just waiting, he disturbed the Saegusa family, he was helped to get rid of annoying glances and he had a good time.

	 - ... This will not be a problem?

	 - Not at all. Then, let's go.

	"Er, right now?"

	 - Yes. As Izumi-chan already said, our role of guides has already ended. Hey, Izumi-chan! Kasumi-chan, you too help me.

	 Mayumi stood up, trying to return Izumi to this world.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	 The topic of the meeting finally turned to the discussion of what Tomokazu wanted - countermeasures.

	 - ... In other words, Saegusa-san believes that it is necessary to increase popularity among the public masses?

	 On the question of the next head of the Mitsuya family, Mitsuya Motoharu,

	 - Although the word "popularity" is not particularly suitable, but everything is approximately the way you say.

	 Saegusa Tomokazu replied with a smile on his face, a bit like his father Koichi.

	 - Speaking on TV? Unfortunately, I cannot sing and dance.

	 Atsuko's joke aroused laughter among many. Especially among young women participants.

	 - I think if Mutsuzuka san sings on TV, she will be very popular.

	 Tomokazu, similar, also could not restrain himself and keep his face unmoved after this joke. He could do nothing with a bitter smile on his face, but still, it did not become a hindrance, and he continued.

	 - We believe that we need to show more clearly the fact that we are useful to society.

	 - Do you want to create a department of the Magic Association for Public Relations?

	 This remark came from the family of Ichinokura from the Eighteen Assistant Houses. The meeting moved in the direction of supporting the opinion of Saegusa Tomokazu.

	 - I think it will be effective too. In addition to simple propaganda, it is also necessary to distribute photos and video scenes showing our active useful actions.

	 Despite the fact that Tomokazu did not strongly insist on his opinion, around him, one after another, he began to receive support.

	 - Show actions? With radio channels, most likely, it will be difficult, but among the satellite and cable channels, it may be possible to find someone ready for cooperation.

	 "But with a deliberate increase in the impact on the media, will it not matter how you look?" Appearing on the screen of video clips, it will be better to have a good appearance.

	 The discussion flowed so shallowly and frivolously, because it was not burdened by the opinions of older people. Perhaps the Saegusa family planned this meeting, foreseeing that it will be so.

	 It was Tatsuya's reasoning, which was still silent at that moment.

	 - And if you have to deal with major catastrophes or atrocities, then abilities also cannot be neglected.

	- A magician who combines good looks and abilities? ... Exactly! Saegusa-san, then this is exactly about your little sister?

	Katsuto and Masaki almost raised their eyebrows almost synchronously when they heard this.

	"You mean Mayumi?" Well, the ability of the magician, I think, by themselves, suitable, but ...

	Tatsuya listened to Tomokazu, who, with his eyes closed and a disappointed face, looked resigned.

	- No no. This is the famous "Elven Princess". I think Mayumi-jo will be very popular on TV.

	"I think she'll be happy to hear this." But if you look at it objectively, then I think you'll notice that there is someone who is much more suitable from the point of view of both appearance and magic.

	- Objectively, you say? You are pretty harsh to your own relatives. But who is this, who surpasses in appearance Mayumi-jo?

	After that, voices of exclamations were heard from different sides of the conference hall.

	- Then, what about the heiress-dono of the Yotsuba family? I think this princess can be a suitable symbol for us.

	Said by the archaic words, the phrase may have been half presented as a joke. However, the remaining half accurately read the severity.

	 A bright light burned in Tomokazu's eyes. It seems that he reached the point where he was ready to say the most important thing at this meeting.

	 - Juumonji-san.

	 However, ahead of the opponent only for a moment, for the first time at this meeting, Tatsuya spoke.

	 - What? - Katsuto briefly answered Tatsuya.

	 - Earlier I heard that "this meeting does not solve anything."

	 Tatsuya did not introduce himself, despite the fact that he spoke for the first time. He did not consider it necessary. Because his words were not meant for the representatives of 28 families gathered here, but only for the organizer of this meeting, Katsuto.

	 - That's right.

	 "Then you must understand." Whatever you decide at this meeting, the Yotsuba family does not have to follow this.

	 Even if he spoke in modest words, it looked like a speech, inciting a quarrel and "pouring oil into the fire."

	 - This is not a problem.

	But this was not an attempt at a quarrel. There were other people who tried to bypass the rules.

	 - Yotsuba-dono, this ... - With a face discouraged, Itsuwa Hirofumi began to speak hesitantly with Tatsuya.

	 - I'm sorry. My name is Shiba Tatsuya.

	 Tatsuya's answer to these words sounded as if he were saying that it was better not to contact him. Mutsuzuka Atsuko and Yatsushiro Takara looked at Tatsuya with glances in which "curiosity" was read. Seated next to Masaki, although surprised, he looked at Tatsuya with understanding, sympathetic eyes. When the topic moved to Mayumi, Masaki also feared that the conversation could reach Miyuki.

	Katsuto's gaze on Tatsuya probably contained a bit of reproach. Not because of the fact that such a smoothly reached agreement was destroyed. "Do something with this frozen atmosphere," Katsuto said in silence.

	 - ... Actively contribute to the society and actively attract attention. A great idea.

	 Realizing that he himself was the culprit, who intervened in the discussion, Tatsuya decided that an answer to Katsuto's request would be inevitable.

	 "However, many magicians work in the police and in the fire department." In the army there is also a huge number of magicians. Intervention in their work will look like your own achievement?

	 However, the atmosphere in the conference room only froze harder. To Tatsuya's remark, there was not a single objection.



	But there was no vote of support either. To the side of the friendly general mood that broke this, Tatsuya was directed a lot of hostility. But Tatsuya did not add another word after that either.

	 Unaware of the snowstorm that broke out right now in the conference room of the Bay Hills Tower in Yokohama, where her older brother is now, Shiina was heading for training at the Third Lab.

	 The Third Research Institute, that is, the Third Magician Development and Improvement Institute, is one of five laboratories that remain unchanged from the original ten laboratories.

	 It is said that out of these still remaining five laboratories, the Third one is the most active one.

	 The topic of the Third Research Institute study is to improve the abilities of the Multi Casting. They search for opportunities to increase the limit of the number of simultaneously activated spells. And also make these abilities available to magicians not only from the Ten Master Clans. In particular, it was aimed at increasing the combat power of military magicians, both using the techniques of the Chiba family, and other soldiers who achieved similar results individually.

	 And as a natural consequence of this, the Third Research Institute was frequented by a large number of military magicians. There were many army researchers, but there were also a large number of combat magicians.

	 Therefore, since childhood, attending training in such a situation, Shiina, despite her innocent appearance, had a rather high fighting power. If not a problem with hearing, then she would become the best martial artist of the Mitsuya family. In the person of her father, Mitsuya Gena, this was not a disappointment, but, on the contrary, relief. Of course, there was no disappointment, because there was less concern that Shiina would follow the path of becoming a war magician.

	 Shiina also had many opportunities to get acquainted with the military who often visit the Third Research Institute. One of the especially close such acquaintances was with a woman from the same 28 families that she herself was.

	 - Ah ~, Tsukasa-san.

	 - Ara, Shiina-chan. Today, too you came to do training?

	 National Defense Army, intelligence department, foreman Tooyama Tsukasa. Although here it was represented as Tooyama, Shiina had known for a long time that Tsukasa was actually Tooyama.

	 - And Saburou-kun is not with you?

	 On this phrase, which sounds quite ordinary, Shiina has made her face inflated.

	 - Saburou-kun went to the Chiba family's dojo.

	 - Chiba's family?

	 - Yes. It seems that he wants to become a student there.

	Restraining herself so as not to laugh, Tsukasa again looked at Shiina in the face with sincerity on her face.

	 - Given the features of Saburou-kun, I think the Kenju of the Chiba family will suit him. Only this is not training, but the training of a warrior *.

	[Here an expression is used, which sometimes can mean something like "a journey to improve your skills". Sometimes it is used with sarcasm, meaning "quixotism", i.e. useless actions.]

	- ... And how are they different?

	- Ara, there is almost no difference. Tsukasa winked with a playful smile. She smiled back. "By the way, Shiina-chan, how is your magic high school?" Probably, it's hard for you there?

	"Not as hard as I thought." But from now on, it may be harder ...

	- And the president of the school council is really from that family of Yotsuba?

	- Ah ~, that's all right. There is tension from the fact that she is so beautiful, but I did not experience the "fear" that I imagined before our first meeting.

	- Here it is. Okay, let's go, can I ask you to help a little with my work?

	Having created a friendly atmosphere of candor, Tsukasa, as if at ease said her request.

	"Uh, the work of Tsukasa-san ... means the intelligence department?"

	- Yes. But there's nothing so complicated. I'm looking for someone to take the role of hostage, to train for the release of an important person.

	- ... Does the intelligence department deal with such matters?



	- The task of the post that I occupy in the department is counterintelligence. This includes the return of kidnapped important people in order to prevent information leakage.

	 - And I'll come up for this?

	 Shiina looked puzzled, but, truth be told, it aroused her interest. In fact, she was very curious.

	 - Everything is fine. But in time it will take about half a day.

	 Tsukasa noticed the curiosity of Shiina.

	 - Yeah, just let me think a little.

	 - Yes OK. Then we'll talk about the details when you decide.

	 "Er, but you cannot tell in advance?"

	 - These are the rules.

	 Shiina was already close to losing to her curiosity. At such a rate, it will soon take hold of it.

	 If "he" hears that a pupil of the same school, moreover, a first-grader from the same school board, became a hostage, he too cannot ignore it. She got a good reason to check "him."

	 With a kind smile on her face, Tsukasa wondered what a nice little sister she could turn out from Shiina.

	Edward Clark of the National Science Agency (NSA) of the USNA was a large-scale information system specialist.

	 And also he was the developer of Echelon III, the latest version of the interception system used by the National Security Agency, which has the same NSA cut.

	 The words that Edward Clark designed the Echelon III alone were a delusion. However, no one argued with the fact that he is a key figure in improving the Echelon system as a whole. However, since the process of assembling the Echelon III was extremely secretive, very few people knew about Clark's accomplishments.

	 He usually worked to further improve the information interception system in his personal office in the California branch of the National Science Agency.

	But in reality he was simply left on the post to keep the Echelon III a secret. Clark himself understood this too.

	 However, it did not bother him. On the contrary, he positively perceived this situation.

	 In his hands was information. One that neither the director of the National Science Agency nor the director of the NSA, the defense minister, the secretary of state, or even the president himself knew.

	 He could get free access to information around the world. This addition of the system was built imperceptible from all.

	 Clark shared this secret with a very limited number of people. With those whom he recognized as his partners, worthy of knowing this secret. And this was not limited to the Americans alone.

	 But Edward Clark did not intend to betray the USNA. You could even say that he is a passionate patriot. But his loyalty was not directed to the government, but to the country as such.

	 He believed. The fact that it is information that controls the world.

	 He believed. The fact that only his motherland and its allies are able to control the world.

	 So today he was also busy searching, browsing and analyzing information to make the world the way it should be.

	 - Is it 10 in the morning in Japan?

	 Most branch employees have already gone home. But Clark did not even show signs of wanting to get up from the table.

	 - Oh ... "He" is isolated? The Japanese are also so stupid.

	 At its terminal, by simultaneous translation, the content of the discussion in the conference hall was displayed, which, according to the idea, was impossible to listen to. This was the power built into the Echelon III backdoor system.

	 "Our citizens cannot say too much ... But this can be a great opportunity." If this happens, the biggest threat to our country will be eliminated.

	 Reflecting, Clark spoke to himself. In the terminal of Edward Clark, the text of Tatsuya's conversations and other participants of the meeting in the conference hall in the Tower of Bay Hills of Yokohama was displayed.

	 〔To be continued〕





	AFTERWORD

	 So the 21st volume of the series, "The Prologue of Disturbance (Part 1)", was released. " How do you like it?

	 Finally, "The Irregular at Magic High" reached the third year of study. Initially, we planned to complete the arch for one volume ... But the volume of information increased, and the arch became a two-volume.

	 One of the reasons for the error in the calculations is that initially it was not planned to show the world situation.

	 In the original plot it was planned to tell only about the episode of "Synchronized Linear Fusion", and the situation in Mexico, Ukraine and Germany to mention in the next arch. However, with the addition of the arch "Zavarushka in the South Sea," the aforementioned episodes had to be written at an accelerated pace, which is not very good. Therefore, the magic of the New Soviet Union also debuted earlier ... but I think that as a result, the overall picture of the series has become more impressive.

	 But the series has increased not only by 1 volume. The biggest difference in the calculations were two new first years.

	 This inflating of information about these characters was a big surprise. I intended to write even more, but suddenly the idea came: did not they make them the main characters of one of the next series arches?

	 Although it is rare for school stories, when someone in the center of attention is 2 years younger than the main characters. ... But regardless of whether this series falls into the category of "school stories" or not, we try to move the plot forward. Both Shiina and Saburou will still show themselves in the next volume.

	 This series also enters the stage of disclosing the secrets of many things. This volume also reveals details about the 2 Strategic Class Magic, about part of the reasons for hiding the Strategic Class Magicians , except for the 13 Apostles, and also reveals the identity of the creator of that system. But among other things, I would like to mention something that I should have told you about for a long time.

	 In the original plan, the title of the entire series, "The Unlucky Apprentice at Magic High " [Another option: Mediocrity in the Magic High] was just the headline for the arch "Enrollment in School." You might think that this is about someone you know.

	 In fact, this would mean that from the arch "Nine Schools Competition" and onwards there had to be another name for the entire series. However, for such a cheap reason that readers might miss the continuation with a different name, we had to continue to use the "Bad Boy in the School of Magic" for the entire series.

	 Therefore, it is worth mentioning that this phrase "The unlucky disciple (mediocrity) in the school of magic" was not about the main character. To be precise, we can say that not only Tatsuya can be considered the main character. And it mostly did not point to him.

	 "Mediocrity" of the arch "Enrollment in the school" is Mibu Sayaka.

	 "Mediocrity" of the arch "Nine Schools Competition", for which another name was planned is Yoshida Mikihiko.

	 "Mediocrity" of the arch "Riots in Yokohama" is Hirakawa Chiaki.

	 In the arch "Guest" Lina, despite her magnificent abilities, eventually had a "mediocre" result.

	 In the arch "Two Seven" ["Twins Saegusa" at the helm], the inferiority complex ("mediocrity") was in the representative of the newcomers, Shippou Takuma.

	 Thus, in this series, emphasis is placed on a contrast comparison between the "unlucky disciple" of each arch and Tatsuya, who was "mediocre" evaluated. Well, this combo was still violated in the arch "Cross with obstacles."

	 So, further goes "The beginning of the unrest (part 2)". Although this is the "Beginning", but after a long editing the arch became a two-volume. Thus, until the meeting in volume 22 of the series, "The Beginning of the Unrest (Part 2)."
