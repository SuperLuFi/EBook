Until last Saturday, they hadn’t been aware of it but Mizuki and Mikihiko’s houses were unexpectedly close.

Mizuki’s house was one station from the city center of Atsugi city.

Mikihiko’s home was in Isehara city at the foot of Mount Tanzawa.

Distance-wise they weren’t that close but regarding commuting on the cabinet line from Atsugi to Isehara, it was around 5 minutes from the closest station to Mizuki’s home to the closest station to Mikihiko’s home.

“Um, Yoshida-kun. Just this far is fine, really…”

“No, that would be pointless.”

They had left just before the school gates closed due to preparing for the Thesis Competition. Because the topic, Isori had chosen for this time, needed more computer graphics type stuff created than devices constructed; the Art club, Mizuki belonged to, was going all out. Her own specialty was old-fashioned watercolor painting but she was also fairly skilled at CG which was an indispensable ability in this project.

For that reason, she wasn’t able to leave school until the last possible moment. Well, thanks to that, seeing Mizuki home did not interfere with his duties as the Public Morals committee chief.

It was already October and nearly the Tenth. Since long ago, the passing of Autumn Equinox meant that days of autumn were running out. The sky was rapidly starting on the twinkling stars. No matter how much pedestrian traffic there was downtown or how many commuters going directly from the station to their homes; there was no way leaving a girl at the station with a “See you, later” counted as seeing her home. Just as, Mikihiko stated.

Mizuki, herself, was not displeased with Mikihiko seeing her home. However, she was unsure about what to talk about as a couple alone among commuters. It was not like the pair had a wealth of possible topics, they had already exhausted a variety of topics in the cabinet on Saturday and established that they were finished with those on Monday.

Just two people alone in a narrow car without talking. With Mizuki’s slight shyness, the cabinet was quite trying or rather an ordeal.

The interval in front of the station while waiting in line for a cabinet was without talking but, since they were not in a private enclosed space, the silence hadn’t been burdensome.

“Come to think of it, isn’t your specialty watercolors, Shibata-san?”

“Uh, yes.”

Despite the fact that Mikihiko hadn’t waited until, they had gotten into the cabinet to offer up the topic of conversation, he had taken the trouble to think up; it did not prompt any thought of “what an insensitive boy” in Mizuki.

“Really. I like the subtle colouring of watercolors…… I can add color to CG more freely now but, I’m still one of those who wish to paint by brush.”

It was Mizuki’s nature to answer the questions, she was asked, to the fullest.

“Yet, you’re good at CG despite that, incredible.”

“It’s nothing, I still have a long ways to go on watercolors.”

The humble and shy Mizuki’s face turned extremely red and whined “don’t flatter me” without words. Unfortunately, Mikihiko had never garnered EXP in that kind of sensing.

“But, your club president boasts of you. He says your talents for graphics is incredible, Shibata-san. Come to think of it, aren’t you getting good grades in Magic Geometry, Shibata-san?”

“Ye-yes. I have been receiving the points I earned in each round of tests.”

Mizuki smiled jokingly.

“Haha, same as me. Thanks to Magic History and Magic Linguistics, I am maintaining my high rank. However, no matter what I do I have trouble with Magical Engineering.”

“Your specialty is charms, Yoshida-kun…… Eh, come to think of it Yoshida-kun, you didn’t chose Magic Geometry. Why?”

“Because Magic Pharmacology is more useful for my techniques. The truth is I actually want to study Magic Geometry as well.”

“So that’s why you go to Tsudzura sensei’s office occasionally?”

“No, that’s sort of because sensei has been calling me over…”

Even though they were under the impression that there were in no danger, the possibility of it lay between the pair as they talked.

However, no matter how much he was enjoying his conversation with Mizuki, Mikihiko did not shirk his monitoring their surroundings.

Even now, Mikihiko was dealing with the shikigami searching the area. In order to keep Mizuki unaware, he did not cut off the conversation as he used the shikigami and at the same time, he triggered an investigative spell.

The area of the spell did not expand spatially; it expanded in significance. All the gazes upon Mizuki that emitted significant magical waves were reflected in Mikihiko’s mind. It did not matter if it was filled with ill or good will, though the lustful ones were more numerous than the benign ones. She did not stand out next to Miyuki and Erika but Mizuki was also a girl that was significantly cuter than average. Besides, since she became a second year, her body had matured into one that had the power to draw the eye.

The density of that kind of static made it tough but the applied filter picked out the ones suffused with magical waves and sent it into Mikihiko’s mind, irritating him in many ways. While under that strain, Mikihiko located his target without either Mizuki or the magicians gunning for her being aware of it.

Fujibayashi had once stated that Mikihiko had “the glow of a prodigy”. Before he got to know Tatsuya, he had spent a year feeling like a failure. Since he got to know Tatsuya, he had been embroiled in harrowing events and his image of himself had been reexamined and changed inside that year. The degree of growth that had taken in him in the two year period was the equivalent to ten to twenty years for a normal practitioner.

It is the point in the talk to come to this pair. Before their eyes, the door to the commuter car, they were waiting for, opened. Mikihiko let Mizuki get on first, he examined the surrounding area, did the Juhou chant of “Return”—an ancient magic to return a shikigami to the one who dispatched it.




There was an underlayer to this scene. In an abstract sense to be sure, this was not a metaphoric underlayer, this was something taking place around the back entrance to a building rather than the front entryway.

Describing a building’s entrance as an “entryway” did seem strange at first but, anyway it was on the opposite side of the buildings to the storefronts meant to attract customers, even in this age, there were back alleyways created by buildings. Trash was automatically disposed of by a dedicated underground tube, cleaning machines bought by the local district to clean the walkways meant there was no trash so there was no bad smells. However, it was inevitable that the city lights did not reach there.

“Darn it, that brat!”

Lurking in the deep darkness of that pathway, a man in his forties was using a hand to stem off the abusive language.

His right hand was covering the fingers of his left hand that were dripping blood.

“He sent my shiki back to me. Isn’t the Yoshida’s second son supposed to have lost his mystic power!”

Was speaking to himself a habit, he certainly did not act like someone pretending he wasn’t alone.

“Nevertheless that was a violent way to do it…… I was only watching.”

Was the blood flowing longer than he expected,the man temporarily released his left hand and took a card of paper that could not serve as a handkerchief—he had taken out a charm.

“Just for that , I’ll use my own blood as an offering.”

As he spoke, the man pressed a charm to his wound and chanted a curse. Since he bound it with the last activation line of “Kyuu kyuu nyoritsu ryou”, perhaps he was an onmyouji or perhaps some kind of chinese occultist.

“I’m going to make you remember me, you darn Yoshida brat. My blood isn’t cheap.”

“Futile, futile. With your skill, old man, all you would get was your curse returned to you again.”

With a terrified look, the man turned toward the voice. He was not an amateur. He had put up a kekkai to keep anyone being aware of him so he could concentrate on his work. He had not forgotten to put up a “circle” to warn him if anyone approached. Nonetheless, he had been taken completely by surprise.

Without words, the man took out a new charm. There was no way this was an amateur who happened to breach the kekkai by chance. Considering the remarks that had just been made, this was unmistakably an enemy.

However, the man’s spell was not released.

“You’re not watching your back.”

The attention of the man who had turned around had been harvested by the young man who had just approached him from behind. He had gotten hit with an attack that caused him to lose consciousness. As a matter of fact, this was a dangerous act with potential after-effects that could not be ignored. However, they did not show any sign of hesitation.

“These guys are too crappy to be good training. Are guards really necessary?”

“Hey, don’t say that. Enduring inactivity is also part of training.”

The two young men looking at each other resembled each other facially and physically. This was not a resemblance since birth, they had eaten rice from the same pot, they had overcome the same hell, a type of constructed resemblance.

And more than anything, their heads were shaved smooth the same way.




The following day during the break between the first and second periods. Tatsuya visited Public Morals headquarters as requested by Mikihiko.

“Ah, Tatsuya. Sorry about calling you here.”

Tatsuya saw Mikihiko, who had arrived first, operating his handheld console, when he entered the room.

He locked the door and displayed the “In conference” sign.

“No problem. So why the hurry?”

“There’s no time, so I’ll be brief. Yesterday on the way home, Shibata was targeted.”

Tatsuya showed a surprised face at the information given by the harshly scowling Mikihiko.

“Mizuki? But, she didn’t act like that had happened.”

“Shibata is unaware. She was only watched by shikigami, distance viewing and the like and I broke all their spells.”

“Oh, I see.”

The eyes of Mikihiko had an edge of hostility as he stared at Tatsuya as he heard the relief in Tatsuya’s voice.

“It is as you expected, Tatsuya.”

“Ah. Thanks for escorting her for me.”

“But, isn’t it strange?”

Tatsuya pretended that he didn’t understand what Mikihiko was saying and listened to his scolding.

“Why the heck did Shibata-san have to be targeted by those thugs? They weren’t simple punks. I wouldn’t call them top notch but, it felt like they weren’t amateur criminals.”

“Professional criminals?”

“They were ‘Under’ magicians.”

For an instant, Mikihiko faltered as if it was hard to put into words but he did not stay silent.

“Why are guys like that targeting Shibata-san? If their goal was the Thesis Competition then they should be targeting Isori-senpai or Nakajou-senpai or Minakami-senpai. Tatsuya aren’t you hiding something from us? That activation sequence for a modified Shikigami that you showed me before wasn’t something you accidentally found. The guys who attacked you are connected to the ones that are keeping tabs on Shibata-san, right!?”

There was no reply from Tatsuya.

Mikihiko was the first to look away.

“Tatsuya… You can reject me by saying something like ‘it’s unnecessary’ but, I owe you. It is thanks to you that my confidence and ability as a magician was restored.”

Tatsuya tried to interrupt to refute that but, Mikihiko continued to speak.

“So, I wouldn’t be dead-weight. I’ll do anything if I can be of help to you and if you want to keep it secret, I won’t tell anyone.”

He turned his face back to Tatsuya with desperation. The light that could be seen in Mikihiko’s eyes was similar to that of a cornered animal.

“However, if I don’t know what’s happening, I won’t be able to protect Shibata-san!”

Just now, Mikihiko had confessed to Tatsuya that he had special feelings for Mizuki but, he, himself, was probably unaware of it. Tatsuya did not attempt to use that to avoid the conversation.

“I cannot go into detail.”

“Tatsuya!”

Mikihiko naturally raised his voice and pressed closer to Tatsuya.

“A foreign magician who served as a guide for enemy operatives in last year’s Yokohama Incident is being sheltered by the ‘Traditionalists’. I am pursuing him.”

However, when the next words out of Tatsuya’s mouth informed him of a portion of the truth, Mikihiko lost both his voice and the color in his face.

“I’m sorry. That’s all I’m able to say.”

“I see… You—”

Mikihiko stopped speaking before he said JSDF and shut his mouth, taken aback. Even, within a soundproofing field that was not something to be spoken aloud.

“Now, I am the one who is sorry… And, thank you for telling me.”

Mikihiko completely misunderstood. Just as Tatsuya had induced him to.

And, Tatsuya felt no guilt over this. The actual truth of this situation, his relationship with the Yotsuba, was something that should not be known yet. It was still too dangerous for it to be known. It was way too soon to drag Mikihiko in as an accomplice.

“Tatsuya, you said the Traditionalists?”

“Yes. I know the target is being sheltered by them.”

“…Then I think I can be useful. After school… No that wouldn’t work. Can you talk tonight? After I see Shibata-san home, I’ll come back to school again.”

“Got it!”

A time limit hadn’t been set by Maya of course and from Tatsuya’s perspective there was not a reason to rush. It was not like he had a personal grudge with Zhou Gongjin. The unvarnished truth was that leaving it alone wouldn’t make him anxious at all.

However, thought Tatsuya, would Mikihiko really be satisfied with that.



7:30 pm in the evening. As to be expected, by this hour, the work for the thesis competition was finishing up for the day. Only the male students remained but, this wasn’t a problem for either Public Safety or Public Morals.

As usual the former student council officer was there so closing the gate afterwards could be left to the thesis team leader, Isori. However, from the start, the student council president had designated him as her representative to supervise. So no one regarded Tatsuya’s presence after school as suspicious.

Due to not having any free time, his problems—like his normal schoolwork—were piling up pretty high. Tatsuya called up his own curriculum on the student council terminal and dealt with all his towering pile of homework in one swoop.

Immediately after he finished off his physics paper, the chime rang indicating that there was a visitor to the student council room.

“Pixie, please.”

[Yes. Master.]

Tatsuya commanded Pixie who had been turned into the student council’s maid to deal with it. She confirmed the visitor’s bio-data and immediately opened the door. Mikihiko came in and she left by the same door, Tatsuya had already given her orders.

“I’ve kept you waiting, Tatsuya.”

While sitting down on the seat Pixie had offered, Mikihiko made the first easy greeting.

“No, it was a good time for me to take a breather.”

Mikihiko cast a doubtful eye on Tatsuya who answered thus. Tatsuya had left the terminal as it was. Mikihiko could see the lists of reports on the monitor from where he was sitting.

However, the extra tsukkomi broke the tension.

“It’s a bit abrupt but, let’s continue from this morning.”

Mikihiko considered keeping his thoughts fresh more important than the mood and plunged into the main topic.

“I want to confirm one thing. Tatsuya are you certain that the target is being sheltered by the Traditionalists?”

“It was a trustworthy information source.”

“I see…”

Mikihiko spent a brief period of time, only a few seconds, sunken in thought.

“First, let’s make my position clear. Those who claim the name of Traditionalists are a large group made up of both good and bad ancient magicians. It would be fine to say that the Ancient Magicians are divided into the Traditionalists, those who support them and those who oppose them.”

“Really? Master said that they were despised by magicians who succeeded genuine traditions.”

He had not actually got that information from Yakumo however, Tatsuya felt that putting it that way would allay suspicions.

“Certainly. However in contrast, many practitioners who feel constrained by hierarchy and discipline and lack status sympathize with the Traditionalists who are not associated with a Tradition.”

“What about the Yoshida clan?”

A little while ago, Mikihiko had said “Make my position clear”. In short, he probably meant to make either his own or his clan’s position for or against the traditionalists “clear”.

“The Yoshida clan has been called a religious order type of clan from old. Due to the fact that we seek spells that enshrine gods and spells that lead us to god.”

That was a trait of magicians who allied with the Traditionalists.

“So of course, the Yoshida clan is antagonistic to the Traditionalists.”

However, Mikihiko’s reply indicated the reverse.

“The Traditionalists who partnered with the former Lab 9 and we, the Yoshida clan are fundamentally different in how we think about magic. The Yoshida clan’s goal has always been spells that bring us closer to god. So there’s no way we would ally ourselves with guys who want to get stronger by any means necessary.”

Was Mikihiko’s statement his own opinion or was it a set of values given to him by his parents; with only what he stated here, he couldn’t tell. However, it was clear that he took pride in the idea even if he was only borrowing the concept.

“Therefore, this time aside from whatever considerations there are, it is alright to rely on me for this. If you wish it, Tatsuya I think you can get the cooperation of the whole Yoshida clan.”

“No, that would be a bit… If I could call on the Yoshida clan for cooperation then it wouldn’t be something that can’t be talked about.”

“That’s right.”

Tatsuya and Mikihiko meant different things by “can’t be talked about” but, Tatsuya was the only one who knew that.

“Understood then the next thing is to plan. Since Tatsuya can’t give detailed information, I have to think of ways that don’t need it.”

As Mikihiko said that he made a malicious grin that could not be said to be ill suited to his face.

“I don’t know whether to call it good or bad luck, this year’s Thesis Competition takes place in Kyoto, the Traditionalists’ main headquarters.”

What Mikihiko had enthusiastically told him did not match the information he had gotten from Fujibayashi and Minoru in Nara but Tatsuya did not have enough source material to determine who was correct.

“That seems so…”

However, regardless of whichever one was correct, Tatsuya listened to Mikihiko.

“From the start, I expected to dispatch a security team to check the conditions of the site but, I think I’ll add myself to it.”

“Therefore?”

“You can join the security team in charge of that for me right, Tatsuya?”

Mikihiko answered Tatsuya’s question with a question.

Tatsuya was not urged to reply to Mikihiko’s question.

“I can.”

“Then, it would be okay for you to move freely within the city and its environs. Under the pretext of ensuring nothing like what happened last year occurs, the site area to search can be seen as very wide.”

“I’m grateful for that. Then, what about you, Mikihiko?”

“I’ll be the decoy. I’ll hit the New International Conference Center serving as the site with a gaudy investigative spell, I will try with all my might to cause a backlash to the Traditionalists’ senses.”

“Got it.”

Tatsuya smirked understanding Mikihiko’s intentions.

“If the Traditionalists come after me then I can legally claim self-defense. If that happens it won’t be Tatsuya’s business since they’re picking a fight with the Yoshida family.”

“The difference in combat power won’t be a problem?”

“If it’s a one to one confrontation then, I absolutely won’t lose in terms of ability. If the Traditionalists try to overwhelm the Yoshida clan by numbers alone then the other traditional occult groups won’t take it lying down. The important thing is the other side picks the fight. Because members of the ancient style traditions place importance on titles. If I picked the fight then they would probably mill around like gawkers but, if they pick the fight make no mistake they would intercede.”

Tatsuya swiftly ran the simulations for those situations in his head. He feared that fellow members of the Ancient Occult traditions would have a grandiose clash with magic and turn the city and its environs into a battlefield. The police and the military would have their hands full suppressing it and Zhou Gongjin would seize his chance to flee.

However, if it appeared as if the Traditionalists picked the fight first and the Ancient Occult tradition magicians interceded that would give him an excuse to investigate the inner workings of the Traditionalists. For Tatsuya that would mean he could anticipate extremely desirable developments.

“If the other side doesn’t start something?”

“Then my ritual will find Tatsuya’s target. Your opponent is an occult magician from the continent, right? So his psion waves would be different. Thanks to Tatsuya working me to the bone, my awareness of psion waves is at last a skill I’m extremely proficient at. I’m confident that among Ancient Occult practitioners I have no superiors.”

“Big talk.”

As Tatsuya smiled, Mikihiko did not deny that he was bragging. He could discern the differences between the techniques of ancient magicians. He did not recognize similar habits in the psion waves of modern magicians. Because it would be meaningless, even if he observed psion waves that had not yet become spells. Too many different practical methods had been born from Modern magic’s framework to research. For example, even the Stars had almost no magicians who were modern magic magicians that could implement a way to detect the psion waves of parasites as accurately as he himself could.

Mikihiko had a firm foundation to base his confidence on.

“What are you going to do about Mizuki?”

The Mikihiko’s face that had been overflowing with confidence was suddenly clouded. Tatsuya found that easily understood change strange but even he had enough discretion not to laugh at this kind of moment.

“…It is too dangerous for Shibata-san to go with me?”

“Then I’ll arrange for Mizuki’s protection.”

“Can you take care of it?”

“Of course. After all, this was originally my problem.”

Mikihiko sighed, relieved. He probably thought Tatsuya would make arrangements with the JSDF.

The truth was he had already had Yakumo’s students protecting Mizuki but, he intended to have another team dispatched from a different source than Mikihiko expected just in case.

“When shall we do it?”

“I’ll lay the groundwork on the school’s side of things as the public morals chief… Friday?”

“Understood. I’ll tell Miyuki to make the preparations in secret on the student council’s side of things.”

“…But, you’re a member of the student council as well, Tatsuya? Do it yourself.”

Tatsuya didn’t reply to that, just made a malicious smirk.

Mikihiko also made a pained smile and stood up.




Common Era 2096, October 11th, Sunday evening, a certain place within the city limits of Kyoto.

The sky was heavy with clouds and even now rain threatened to pour out of the black night sky.

Even this park that was a place for people to rest during the day, now that it was the middle of night showed little sign of the presence of people. And on this particular evening, there were only two human silhouettes.

“Nakura-sama. Have I made you wait?”

Zhou Gongjin called out to Nakura who was standing by the riverside as he walked from upstream.

“No, you are right on time, Zhou-san.”

Nakura looked up and replied with a suitably friendly greeting.

Although they both extended their hands, they were still careful to keep exactly the right distance as they faced each other.

“It’s been about two months.”

Zhou started the conversation,

“Yes, I haven’t contacted you for a while. Even if I tried to visit, I do not know where your new residence is, you will just have to forgive me.”

Nakura countered Zhou’s Jab with matching bluntness.

“Last month, I was surprised by a matter suddenly coming up that left me no choice but to move. If you knew about it beforehand, you could have informed me.”

“No, I cannot express how impossible it would have been. Considering who your opponent was, it is inevitable that we couldn’t have gotten a clue beforehand.”

Zhou had turned tail and ran away from Kuroba at Nakura’s directive and Zhou was being sarcastic when he spoke about it being too tough for the Saegusa clan to get inside information from the Yotsuba. Zhou made a graceful smile at the honest look that Nakura met his ill tempered outburst with. —This was their normal way of interaction.

“So then, Nakura-sama, what could be your business today?”

Zhou’s smile was so unshaken as if his face didn’t know how to make any other expression but a smile as he questioned Nakura. There was no trace of impatience. The situation was not suitable for a long conversation.

“Zhou-san, are you aware of Kudou joining forces with Yotsuba?”

Zhou’s eyebrows twitched in surprise. Still, his smile did not collapse. “No… Could it be because of me?”

“I believe the situation is thus, Zhou-san, the Yotsuba clan knows that the Traditionalists are sheltering you, so they requested the aid of the Kudou clan who have an adversarial relationship with the Traditionalists.”

“Hahahahaha……”

Zhou suddenly burst out laughing.

“I’ve become quite prominent. Not just the Yotsuba who are at the pinnacle of the strongest in the modern world even the former holders of the title ‘the strongest’, the Kudou are aiming for me!”

Zhou Gongjin laugh seemed so happy.

He did not get desperate; this was not the madness of someone driven into a corner.

From the start, tranquility disturbed him—his laugh gave off that impression.

“The Kudou clan with their long hostile relationship with the Traditionalists have probably investigated them thoroughly. I believe without a doubt it will not take long to pinpoint your hiding place.”

Nakura was unmoved by Zhou’s weirdness and indifferently continued his analysis.

Zhou quelled his laughter and answered in a cynical voice.

“Right, certainly. The gentlefolks of the Traditionalists have taken care of me for nearly two months, however, just about now would be a suitable time to take my leave. So do you Nakura-sama or rather the Saegusa clan say that they can furnish me with a new hiding place?”

“Yes.”

That didn’t seem to be the answer he was expecting. Zhou cast a doubtful eye upon the agreeing Nakura.

“Let us speak frankly. The Saegusa cannot permit you to fall into Yotsuba hands, Zhou-san. Because the link between you, Zhou-san, and the Saegusa clan absolutely must not be revealed.”

“So you prepared an escape route for me beforehand?”

“Yes.”

Zhou used the words, “escape route” rather than “hiding place” when he asked Nakura for confirmation.

“I will escort you to a place the hands of the Yotsuba can’t reach.”

“Really… Could the name of that place be…”

Zhou casually reached into his pocket.

Nakura had already, unobtrusively gripped a cell phone shaped CAD.

“…Something like the pyre!”

“No, the name of the place is Hell!”

The pair simultaneously kicked off of the ground to gain distance. Zhou took a glowing black talisman from his pocket—what he produced was an inscribed card and Nakura let loose an activation sequence from his CAD.

Zhou probably had the spell on standby from the beginning. Their magics activated at the same time.

An entirely black, four-legged beast came from Zhou’s card, likely a synthetic body that imitated a dog had leapt out. The black dog instantly sprang off the ground to make a pounce straight at Nakura’s windpipe.

Ten-odd transparent needles pierced the shadowy body from below.

Nakura’s leg was submerged in the river. The needles that pierced the shadow beast were fired off from the vicinity of that leg.

“Water needles, huh……”

Zhou’s eyes were able to perceive the nature of the transparent needles within the darkness.

“That was careless. It was a mistake to set the meeting at the riverbank. The ‘higher ground’ advantage seems to be yours.”

“That is magic that constructs a synthetic beast using shadows as a medium.”

“Yes. The boring name is embarrassing but, my master calls it, ‘Shadowbeast’. The spell is a hybrid magic that incorporates western sorcery making it too disgraceful to brag about.”

“Western sorcery…… A hell hound, eh. So, I erred on ‘time’, huh. I should have at least made it a night when the moon was out.”

The pair was not just carelessly exchanging discourse on techniques. As they were talking, the shadowbeast was spat out of the card Zhou had in his hand and Nakura intercepted it with the water needles.

Zhou did not appear to be composing new magic. In short, the inscribed card Zhou held probably had many more beasts stockpiled within. Despite the fact that the number was already over ten, there was no sign of the supply being exhausted. Just how many layers of magic had been piled on to that tiny card, it’s capacity seemed to have no bounds.

“However, I don’t understand.”

“What?”

None the less, the first to voice a question was Zhou.

Nakura’s expression did not change; he was attacking the phantom beast, Zhou had summoned mechanically. The reply, he made to Zhou, was almost completely devoid of emotion.

“The development focus of Lab 7 was colony control magic. At the very least, colony control magic should be able to move over 100 objects simultaneously. The number of objects being manipulated shouldn’t be this low. Could it possibly be that you are taking it easy on me?”

“Ridiculous. You are not an opponent I can take lightly, Zhou-san.”

Nakura answered with a regretful voice. Zhou’s attention was more drawn to the emotion packed into the voice than the statement.

“Zhou-san, do you know of the words, extra numbers?”

Water needles flew toward Zhou. Although they could not possibly be discerned in the darkness by the human eye, Zhou easily dodged them with a sidestep.

This was not a speed within the range of human physical prowess. It was probably an ancient magic of the continent that had the same effects as personal acceleration magic.

“I know of it. Magicians descended from magicians that were granted a number by the magician development labs that created the Ten Master Clans but were later stripped of their number.”

Water needles flew one by one. Despite keeping Zhou busy dodging, the timing with which the shadowbeasts were summoned was unabated. The positions of offense and defense were instantly reversed.

“So, what are the reasons for stripping numbers?”

“Search me, I am not that well informed. But, the only reason I’m aware of is the desired abilities wasn’t developed.”

The needles became a downpour. Zhou pulled out a handkerchief from his chest pocket.

The white handkerchief expanded to a size that covered his entire body, it defended him from the water needle shower.

Nakura ceased his attack.

Zhou peeked his face out from underneath the cloth.

“I am without a doubt, a magician who is unable of developing the ability that Lab 7 hoped for.”

“Really, sorry about that.”

Zhou fired off a single shadow beast.

Nakura operated his CAD and barely managed to shoot it down.

Zhou lowered the hand holding the inscribed card.

Nakura kept his fingers on his CAD, as the discussion about Extra Numbers resumed.

“The basic model of colony control magic is to prepare the projectile beforehand with a spell to manipulate it.”

Nakura unfolded an activation sequence.

Zhou prepared the white cloth.

“However, I didn’t think that was combat effective. Battle doesn’t only occur at times when you conveniently have a bulky medium on hand. Despite the fact the development of an assistance tool known as a CAD that you could wear all the time, for some reason you had to carry all that extra stuff.”

“Your words would make the ears of the type of ancient occultists who couldn’t use magic without having curse tools to use as a convenient medium burn. However, I believe CADS are not the only ‘things you can wear all the time’? There are also types that look like large guns?”

“Gun-shaped CADs are specialized model. I don’t think those are combat effective either.”

Nakura and Zhou remained on the brink of invoking magic, they both were looking for a gap in the other’s defenses. Perhaps, even the very words, they were exchanging, might be a tactic to create an opportunity.

“Anyway I could not comprehend the Laboratory’s plan. Therefore, I arranged sequences that could use colony control magic at any time. At that same time, the number of targets I can control is less than 100 but, in exchange, I worked out a technique to make liquids form projectiles.”

“How unfortunate.”

“As a result, the number was stripped.”

At this point, the order in which they made statements was reversed.

Zhou Gongjin laid the trap.

A fragment of Nakura’s mind was distracted.

Zhou threw the inscribed card at Nakura.

While he was caught off guard, Nakura pelted water needles at Zhou. It was not a barrage, he created an orbiting circle.

A shadowbeast jumped out of the inscribed card midair.

Nakura composed new magic to ambush it.

The white cloth fell with a thud. Zhou was no longer over there.

The shadowbeast, pierced by the water needles, dissolved into the night’s shadows.

The pack of water needles that were making an arc fruitlessly penetrated the air.

The inscribed card that fell onto the surface of the river spat out a black shadow.

Nakura, who caught that at the corner of his eye, invoked a leaping spell.

Nakura avoided the spray of water that spat from the jaw by a hair’s breadth.

Nakura, who landed on the other bank, prepared his next attack as he corrected his stance. As Nakura eyed the darkness of the river between the banks, his abdomen was pierced from behind by a black horn.



The horn, piercing Nakura’s abdomen, broke down to a thick gooey tar like substance that was blown away by the night wind that passed over the surface of the river. Robbed of the support, Nakura collapsed face up.

He could hear the sound of footsteps treading on river pebbles from the direction of his head. With difficulty, he looked in that direction; the first thing he saw was Zhou covered by a white cloth. Zhou was walking from the other side. He wasn’t unwounded either. The fabric at the left shoulder and right flank of his expensive three piece suit had open holes from which blood sullied it.

“It appears that you were not deceived by the shadowbeast.”

Nakura understood what had happened without an explanation. He had leaped to the opposite bank intending to get away from Zhou but, Zhou had actually been on this side, he had turned his back on his enemy when he landed.

“Yes, I, myself, took the part of your plaything.”

“Directional…misdirection…is…this…the…ancient…art…of…Kimon…Tonkou?”

It was difficult to understand Nakura’s broken speech but, Zhou’s ability to understand was unimpeded.

“Yes. Nevertheless, it has been a long time since my blood has flowed this much. I can say without lying that the skills of Nakura Saburo outstrip those of Kuroba Mitsugu.”

“Ha…ha…ha…I…am…honored.”

Zhou knelt down on one knee next to Nakura and spoke in a gentle voice.

“We have been close enough to share sake together. Don’t you have any last wishes?”

“A…wish…yes…I…have…just…one.”

“What could it be?”

“That…you……”

“Yes.”

“Please die with me!”

Nakura mustered the last of his strength as he shouted.

That spell—could be called the words of a curse.

Nakura’s body burst open from the chest and needles made from his blood attacked Zhou Gongjin.

Zhou stood up.

He scowled looking at the red needles that pierced the arms that had protected his face.

“There are many wishes, I would be willing to grant since it was your last one, however…”

He groped for the needles that had slipped through the gaps that both arms had left to reach his ears to get them out.

The needles melted back into blood and tiny scars remained on his earlobes. Zhou blew out a sigh and took out a new inscribed card from his jacket pocket.

When the blood needles met the time limit for phenonomen modification, they melted all at once.

He chanted a short spell.

The piercing wounds on Zhou Gongjin’s skin disappeared like a time lapsed photo images (high-speed regeneration).

“Unfortunately, this level of magic cannot kill me.”

Zhou got up and sighed as he looked at his own skin. He had probably expected Nakura to have some kind of self destructive attack prepared. He had got his arms up in time to protect his face because he was watching for a water needle attack.

“Can’t stay here any longer. Even if it is the middle of the night, I can’t help standing out looking like this.”

However, that was because he hadn’t foreseen that Nakura would use his own blood to attack him. He looked down at his clothes that were smeared with his victim’s blood and let out a sigh.

Zhou took out the handkerchief, he had returned to his pocket unnoticed.

No, he hadn’t returned it. This was clearly a different one from before.

It was not white, it was a black handkerchief.

He expanded the darkness colored handkerchief, he covered his body with a large wide shadow.

The handkerchief that turned into a black cloth changed into a shadow, leaving nothing but Nakura’s body behind.





Chapter 5




October 12th, Friday. With half a month remaining until the Thesis Competition on October 28th, the hustle and bustle within the school abruptly increased. The Kyoto Thesis Competition was said to be dedicated to pure theory, expectations were that the operational details wouldn’t be as extensive as last year’s, but in the end, it turned into a tremendous commotion.

As the presenter, Isori personally took command and entered the fray to manage the preparations. Hattori was in command of the security team and was zealous in training them. Honoka and Izumi were working together to get a handle on the arrangements to travel to Kyoto.

Of course, neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki were playing around. As Student Council President, Miyuki was responsible for keeping an eye on the progress of the entire operation and dispatching help to portions where it was bogging down. The help in most cases was Tatsuya. He participated in presentation preparations, he took part in the training of the security team and when Miyuki, Honoka and Izumi couldn’t be in multiple places, he took care of the Student Council business and he also flitted about as Miyuki’s aide.

When Mikihiko finally came to the Student Council room, Tatsuya had tied up his exhausting work long enough to take a break, just around the time the school gate was closing after school.

“Pardon me…”

It seemed like Mikihiko was not yet used to using the connecting staircase between the student Council room and Public Morals headquarters. There was a distinct difference between him and the carefree Shizuku who came in with him (additionally, Shizuku was in the midst of guarding Azusa). “You’re right on time, Mikihiko.”

Although Tatsuya called out to him in a lighthearted tone, Mikihiko nervousness wasn’t that easily dispelled.

“Well then…… Since I was able to see how busy you were, there was no way I was going to be later than I promised.”

Hearing that statement, Miyuki let out a laugh that somehow exuded recognition.

“It would be a relief if everyone was as earnest as Yoshida-kun.”

Feeling that this was the calm before the storm, Tatsuya urged Mikihiko to get down to business.

“Mikihiko, shall we begin the briefing right away?”

“Yes, let’s.”

Perhaps, Mikihiko got the same impression, he spread out the huge roll of electronic paper, he had in his hand onto the conference table.

A map of the city of Kyoto emerged on the electronic paper that almost completely covered the table.

“Today’s briefing is regarding the preliminary report on the security of the actual location.”

In a formal tone, Mikihiko begun his explanation.

“Regarding security on the actual day, the former head of club activities, Hattori has been assigned to proceed with the arrangements. Hattori-senpai is also personally overseeing the briefing of the other schools and I think it’s fine to leave it to him, right.”

“Is it alright not to have invited Hattori-senpai to this meeting?”

The one who nodded in answer to Honoka’s question as if to say it was fine was not Mikihiko but Tatsuya.

“An agreement was reached with former chairman Hattori, that it would be fine if he was merely notified of the results of the briefing. Right, Chief Yoshida.”

“It is as Secretarial Chief Shiba says.”

Mikihiko seemed to have trouble saying the title, “Secretarial Chief”. However, he didn’t have the nerve to ignore the official title in front of Miyuki.

“Former Chairman Hattori said it was fine for him not to take part in today’s briefing. Since all we’re doing is gathering information. Doesn’t all he need to do is use the resulting data.”

Perhaps, he couldn’t ignore his uneasiness with speaking in a formal manner; Mikihiko carelessly lapsed into an informal friendly manner.

“It’s about time to get to the essentials.”

Perhaps, Tatsuya also found that easier, he immediately matched that mode of speaking.

“Okay. So, please look over here.”

Although, his tone was friendly, this was the way he always spoke to Miyuki.

“This is the site, the New International Convention Center.”

“That’s pretty much in the outskirts of the city.”

Looking at the map, Izumi stated her opinion undiffidently.

“It seems like there’s a strong feeling in the area about not wanting to have conventions in the middle of the city.”

After answering Izumi’s question while smiling ironically, Mikihiko’s face stiffened.

“Unlike last year, the volume of traffic in the area is not that much. So it can be seen that there aren’t too many places where criminals, subversives and the like can ambush us. However, because the area is so rural, it is extremely easy to conceal the preparations to do so.”

Mikihiko temporarily enlarged the vicinity of the convention center before, replacing it with the map of the entire city of Kyoto.

“And, even if there is not a close hiding place; I also believe that there are potential locations that can be converted to a base not too far away.”

As had been arranged beforehand, Miyuki broke in during the pause in the conversation.

“In short, it is your opinion, Yoshida-kun, that a much wider area than the vicinity of the site should be investigated?”

“Yes. No way do we want a repeat of last year.”

Without a moment’s delay, Tatsuya let loose the second round of covering fire.

“Agreed. Although we are nothing more than high school students, we still need to do everything we can.”

Tatsuya garnered gazes filled with surprise. In any case, Honoka, Izumi and Minami who knew the hidden details turned their eyes toward him without intending to but, right now, it was important that Honoka and Izumi not develop any lingering suspicions about what the people who left were doing.

“So, Mikihiko. who are you going to send on the preliminary investigation?”

“I’ll go.”

“Is it alright for the Public Morals Chief to be absent from school?”

“I intend to entrust the school to Kitayama of the guard detail. Also I wish Tatsuya to come.”

“No problem. It’s probably necessary for at least one member of the security team to check over the actual site.”

Tatsuya followed up with a nod; Miyuki raised her hand.

“Onii-sama, is it alright if I go with you?”

“You, the Student council president?”

Tatsuya asked the question without becoming visibly paler. Acting in these kinds of conditions was more of a specialty of Miyuki’s.

“I wish to set up an appointment, check out the hotel the cheering squads are staying at, personally. I wish to confirm that there is a shelter, they can be evacuated to if the unlikely occurs.”

“Miyuki, I can do that.”

“Honoka, don’t you have transportation, reservations, and individual requests to take care of? I am only overseeing the general operation, I don’t have any other specific job.”

“Oh, alright……”

A disappointed Honoka yielded.

Izumi seemed to want to say something as she listened to Miyuki and Honoka’s exchange but, Miyuki turned to her before she spoke.

“Izumi-chan while I am on my trip to Kyoto, won’t you to take my place and run things for me as the Vice President?”

“Please, leave it to me. Use me to the fullest!”

It goes without saying, Izumi actually wanted to go with Miyuki to Kyoto as well. Having been asked by her esteemed Miyuki herself to be her proxy, she wasn’t able to say no. Rather, Izumi was the type of the girl who would be all excited over “Miyuki-senpai asked me to do something for her!”

“What’s the schedule?”

“It would be a little tight but, how about a 2 day and 1 night trip on the weekend before the Thesis Competition, the 20th to the 21th?”

“It’s a good plan, have you already pinned down the accommodations.”

“No, I thought we’d decide on that now?”

“I see. Minami.”

Tatsuya’s calling out to Minami was the last of their planned moves.

“Yes?”

In spite of explaining this scenario to Minami as well, she was not very surprised. —She always seemed more composed than suited her age.

“Sorry, but will you make the hotel reservations for me. If you can make it, the hotel we are staying in the day before the Thesis Competition. For four people: me, Miyuki, Mikihiko, and you, Minami.”

“Me, as well?”

“Uh, huh. You will help Miyuki over there for me?”

Regret passed over Izumi’s face in response to Tatsuya’s statement. She was probably thinking she wanted to be running around supporting Miyuki herself. However, she had already accepted the job of being Miyuki’s stand in. If Tatsuya had been the one who had asked her, Izumi would probably have easily withdrawn her previous agreement. However, it was impossible for Izumi to even think of abandoning a task Miyuki had asked her to do.



It was time for the school gates to close, Tatsuya was slightly ahead Honoka whom he was escorting in leaving the student council room. They were going to where Shizuku who was guarding Azusa who was directing the construction of the presentation device was.

Along the way, they linked up with Mikihiko who was done with locking up Public Morals headquarters and the three went to the experiment building.

Aside from the work Isori was overseeing the auditorium, Azusa was making a console CAD that would compare the experiment’s effects.

“Shizuku!”

Honoka called out to Shizuku. For some reason, Chikura Tomoko and Sayaka who were on Azusa’s security detail with Shizuku and Kirihara who was supposed to be guarding Carey, all turned to look at Tatsuya.

“Shiba, what’s up? We should have put in the requests to work overtime.”

As expected, Kirihara had already stopped calling him “Shiba Ani”. Tatsuya was “Shiba” and Miyuki was “President”. It could be called the most proper way of addressing them.

“Certainly, the overtime requests were accepted but, it’s still bad for female students to stay late into the night at school.”

“…But.”

Kirihara notified Sayaka that they were leaving soon with a glance backward. Apparently, Sayaka felt the need to be willful about it.

“What’s up?”

As the mood was on the verge of turning uncomfortable, Shizuku asked Honoka that. She probably intended to switch the topic of conversation since she could read the mood but, Tatsuya and Mikihiko had a different matter to discuss with Shizuku.

“Kitayama-san, I want to ask you a little favor.”

“Ask me?”

Mikihiko broached the matter while fighting the urge to snicker at the classically exaggerated puppet like head tilt she made.

“As it happens, we discussed going to Kyoto for a look around before the Thesis Competition.”

“To prepare for something like last year?”

When Shizuku heard the words “Look around”, she grasped the unstated reason.

“Right. For two days, we intend to check out various matters on a 2 day 1 night stay starting the 21st. Will you act as Public Morals Chief for me for those 2 days?”

For some reason, Shizuku looked toward Honoka instead of the bowing Mikihiko.

“What about you, Honoka?”

“Eh, I’m… Staying here?”

“Hmmmm……”

Shizuku’s focus switched to Tatsuya.

“Are you going, Tatsuya-san?”

“Uh, huh.”

Shizuku thought about it for a moment then, said “Okay” to Mikihiko.

“Thank you. That’s a relief.”

“Your welcome.”

As she spoke, her eyes were not looking toward the still bowing Mikihiko but toward Honoka who was avoiding looking at Tatsuya.




Inside the cabinet on the way home, Tatsuya was reading web news articles when his face changed to a “Say what?” type of expression.

“Onii-sama, is something wrong?”

Miyuki who was sitting next to him noticed immediately and questioned him.

“Ah, this news.”

Tatsuya turned the information terminal toward Miyuki. A local Kyoto news article was displayed there. It seems like Tatsuya had already started collecting information.

The article contained a full report on the body of a murdered man discovered at a famous sightseeing spot.

“It was discovered this morning, the victim’s Nakura Sanburo-san…… Onii-sama, this person!?”

Miyuki also readily understood the reason for Tatsuya’s reaction.

“Someone you know?”

That was a natural question, Minami did not recognize the name.

“If it is not somebody with the same name, this is the magician that serves as Saegusa Mayumi’s bodyguard.”

Minami’s eyes widened.

“It is the same gentleman, right?”

“I don’t know, there isn’t a picture.”

Although that is what he said but, Tatsuya intuitively believed that this victim was the elderly magician that was Mayumi’s guard.

“If it is the same gentleman…… Could it be a coincidence?”

The question, Miyuki voiced was the same one that Tatsuya and Minami were grappling with.

A magician of the Saegusa Clan was killed in Kyoto where it was likely Zhou Gongjin was in hiding. Additionally, his body indicated the death had been violent.

Normally, it would be unthinkable to write the condition of the body in an article; perhaps, it was because it was the result of magic combat.

A magician who was likely an extra yet skilled enough to be entrusted with guarding the eldest daughter of the Saegusa clan had been killed in magic combat. Even skills to that extent could be overcome. Like by that man who deeply wounded Kuroba Mitsugu and break through the Kuroba Execution squad’s perimeter and escape…

There was no way Tatsuya could consider this a coincidence.




The one who was most surprised to see the news that Nakura had been killed was unmistakably her.

“Otou-sama, please explain this!”

Having been informed that Kouichi had returned home, Mayumi went into his study uninvited.

“Nakura-san has been killed, what does this mean!?”

Both hands gesturing wildly in front of the grandiose desk, she pressed Kouichi who sat beyond it for answers.

“How do you know Nakura was killed?”

“There was a call from the police asking about his background!”

“You took it? What about school?”

“They couldn’t contact Otou-sama or my Onii-samas so, they moved on to me!”

“Dolts……what were you doing…”

Kouichi let out a reproachful murmur at his sons’ mistakes while ignoring his own. Listening to this, Mayumi became even more incensed.

“That kind of thing doesn’t matter!”

Her father and the elder of her brothers’ disappearances and the younger of her brothers’ pretending that he wasn’t home were normal occurrences and as far as she was concerned completely trivial.

“Enough, please stop dodging! They said Nakura-san was killed, what does that mean!?”

“It means what it says, right? Nakura was killed. A good man has died.”

“That isn’t what I’m asking! Why was Nakura-san killed in Kyoto!?”

“There’s no reason for you to know.”

Kouichi coldly rebuffed his daughter. However, Mayumi did not flinch from something of this degree, she was not a weak Ojou-sama.

“Nakura-san was my bodyguard. I should meet the qualifications of knowing.”

The tone had become subdued but, deep within fierier emotions swirled. One probably did not have to be Kouichi to know that. Since he knew his daughter’s character, he was aware some degree of compromise was necessary.

“Nakura was dispatched to Kyoto to do certain work. He probably got entangled in some trouble there.”

“Certain work? What was that?”

“An important task for the Saegusa clan of the Ten Master Clans.”

“I got that! What was the task!?”

“You don’t need to know.”

However, Kouichi would not acknowledge a need for a greater degree of compromise than that.

That was communicated to Mayumi as well. She realized questioning him even further was futile.

“…Understood. Excuse me.”

Feeling a great deal of mistrust for her father, Mayumi left the study.



However, Mayumi had not given up on her quest for the truth.

To tell the truth, Mayumi and Nakura hadn’t really been that friendly. Nakura’s manner was normally courteous to Mayumi and always that of a servant. Mayumi hadn’t known him well, he had made her feel uneasy.

Even so, for a non-short period of time, he was someone she had known that had accompanied her in her movements and had been killed. Moreover, he had died due to a task set by her own father.

Mayumi completely disbelieved her father’s words, “He probably got entangled in some trouble there”. She was convinced that he had not been dragged into something while he was working but rather he was killed because he was working.

However, that was nothing more than Mayumi’s intuition, just now she had nothing to base it on. She acknowledged that herself.

“What’s up, Mayumi. You have been breathing out sighs for some time now. Besides, you seem somewhat dispirited. Is something wrong?

“Eh? No, Mari. It’s nothing.”

“It doesn’t look like nothing but… If it is really nothing then put it out of your mind. You’ve been thinking about it for a while now.”

“Oh, I have!?”

Flustered, Mayumi sat up straight and fixed her gaping collar and straightened the cuffs of her sleeves.

They were at the Magic University’s cafe, it was the time between the morning and afternoon lectures also known as lunchtime. It was a period of time when a lot of students gathered together after finishing their meals, this was not a time when the sight of the honored daughter of the Saegusa Clan of the Ten Master Clans appearing somewhat listless would go unnoticed.

By the way, Mari being here did not mean she was skipping out on her Defense College educational regime. There were special military skills research classes at the Magic University—to put it simply, there were classes to educate magicians to be officers—under this system the Defense College would send over a chosen student once a week to take part in the lectures with those accepted into the lecture course. Mari had been chosen and today was the day of the lecture.

Mayumi temporarily looked as if nothing was wrong but she couldn’t keep it up for long. Probably because she felt secure in front of a friend she hadn’t seen in a while. Mayumi forcibly stopped herself when she realized she was sighing deeply again.

“Mari, there’s something I want to consult you about.”

Mayumi put both elbows on the table and concealed her mouth with her hands as she spoke to Mari. It was an ill-mannered pose but it was the easiest way to prevent her lips from being read. It was allowed to use a soundproofing field in the cafe but, magic that obstructed the light because you didn’t want to be seen wasn’t permitted.

“What is it?”

Mari made the same pose. The poses deepened the impression that they were discussing secrets to the spectators.

“Mari, do you remember Nakura-san?”

“That’s your bodyguard, right? What about him?”

“He was killed.”

“Killed, you say, oh no… When?”

Mari had been about to ask “How can you speak about it looking so calm?” but, she looked into Mayumi’s eyes and saw the grief and anger swirling together in them and changed her question as she spoke.

“The day before yesterday, perhaps in the middle of the night. The Kyoto police contacted me yesterday.”

“Kyoto? So it wasn’t someone aiming for you?”

“Uh, huh.”

“I see……”

Mari somehow stopped herself from letting out a sigh of relief without thinking. She was feigning calm but deep in her heart she was wavering at one step away from panic. If someone was gunning for Mayumi, what could she do… The thought whirled. Knowing that for now, it was an absurd fear allowed Mari to grieve for the deceased.

“It’s unfortunate… You have my condolences.”

“Thank you.”

A solemn air flowed between the pair. In these wordless moments, they were probably offering up silent prayers for the deceased.

“So, what was the cause of death? Was it an accident?”

“Murder.”

Mari already expected that answer. For someone employed as a bodyguard by the Ten Master Clans that was a normal risk.

“But, I don’t know the reason.”

Before her eyes, her friend was using all her strength to bear the weighty emotions that were bursting out. Even before she was asked that by Mari, one did not need eyes to see that.

“Father won’t tell me anything more than he sent him to Kyoto on business. What business, what kind of job, everything is unclear. At any rate, I’m sure it was some kind of shady job but even so why did he lose his life…”

A sound of something being swallowed could be heard from Mayumi’s throat. Unmistakably, it was a fit of crying.

“It’s not that I want to avenge him or something.”

Mayumi somehow quieted her emotions and with that calm, she continued to talk with a voice that showed her strong will.

“It’s nothing like that but somehow I can’t just let it go. I feel that it’s something I shouldn’t leave it as it is.”

“What… Do you have some basis for your thinking?”

While she was overwhelmed by Mayumi’s determination, Mari made a rational point.

“Right now, nothing. This is nothing more than my intuition. But, I can’t ignore it. I can’t help feeling anxious.”

“I… Still don’t have much unoccupied time.”

The Magic University and the Defense College were not all that far apart—to be exact, the Magic University and the special tactics research department annex were not that far apart. Also, since the secrets and inherent magics of magic students had to be concealed, student housing had to be in approved dormitories; it wasn’t that hard for them to meet.

However, as Mari implied, there was no freedom in the Defense College’s curriculum as there was in Magic University’s. It could be said with the multiple required courses, a first year student didn’t have room in their life to do anything else. As much as Mari wished that she could help her friend with her worries that was impossible with her schedule.

“……How about consulting with Juumonji or Tatsuya-kun?”

Unexpectedly—she offered up a name, Mayumi hadn’t thought of, her eyes widened and she blinked rapidly, many times.

“I can understand Juumonji-kun but… Why Tatsuya-kun?

“Isn’t this year’s Thesis Competition in Kyoto?”

Mayumi sensed that Mari wasn’t really answering a question with a question.

“The Competition is at most a two day one night stay, right? Besides he’ll be busy, he wouldn’t have the free time to do anything else, right?”

“That stuff happened just last year. Wouldn’t they do their own investigation of the area?”

“Yes, they might do that. But, Tatsuya-kun would probably be helping with the presentation’s preparations and there’s also the student council work. When he’s so busy, to expressly ask him to meet with me…… What?”

Mayumi became aware that Mari was looking at her with a stunned look.

“We have this and that to do as well. Wouldn’t it be fine to just ask him?”

Overwhelmed by the common sense, Mayumi couldn’t come up with even the fragment of a rebuttal.

“Anyway, why have you only been worried about his situation? Isn’t the first thing to do is to get Juumonji-kun’s cooperation? Juumonji is already a college student so isn’t he more likely to be accommodating than Tatsuya-kun the high school student and as for which would be more reliable, I think for sure that it would be Juumonji-kun.”

“Th-that’s……we’re both members of the Ten Master Clans, I don’t want the problems of the Saegusa Clan to cause trouble for the Juumonji Clan.”

Mari didn’t hear Mayumi’s excuse. She was able to hear the sound but, her mind completely ignored it.

“Mayumi, I don’t believe it but…”

“Wh-what?”

Mari’s expression was not the mischievous smile one would wear when teasing a good friend, her face was subtly serious showing her earnest and genuine concern for Mayumi.

“You couldn’t possibly be genuinely in love with him?”

It took some time for Mari’s words to penetrate Mayumi’s consciousness.

“By him… Tatsuya-kun!?”

“Idiot, you’re too loud!”

Since Mayumi had put up a soundproof field, her words didn’t leak out but, Mari’s look was so menacing it made her forget that.

“That’s impossible! Right, impossible! Seriously, me be in lo-lo-lo……”

Mari fixated cool eyes on her mumbling friend.

“Mayumi, if you could see yourself now would you really be able to declare it’s impossible?”

“That is……”

Mayumi’s voice trailed off from lack of confidence.

However, she didn’t end it there. Resolutely, she looked up and puffed out her chest.





“No, that is really impossible. What’s impossible is impossible.”

“…You’re awfully confident but, your statements really lack persuasive power…”

“Tatsuya-kun is a reliable boy. Like a little brother. Right, a little brother. A little brother!”

“No, isn’t that wrong? After all, you and him are not blood related, right?”

“Yes, It’s an elder sister’s right to be helped by her little brother! Alright, I’ll get Tatsuya to help me dig for the truth. First, I’ll check the train schedule for going to Tokyo.”

“No, you should…”

Faced with the strangely confused Mayumi, Mari plopped down with an exhausted look.




October 14th, Sunday. Tatsuya visited the Yokohama branch office of the Magic Association.

Tatsuya informed the reception desk of his name and told them that he had an appointment.

He was already waiting in the interview room.

“Hayama-san, it’s been a while since we have spoken. I have not kept you waiting have I?”

“No, you are right on time, Tatsuya-dono. Since I was the one who summoned you, it is only natural that I arrived first. Please, do not trouble yourself about it any further.”

Tatsuya bowed and stood on the opposite side from Hayama.

As if they had agreed on the timing beforehand, the pair sat down at the same time. The slight firmness of the cushion maintained the feeling of tension that was the impression, Tatsuya harbored on the sofa.

“Your business is a matter to do with the current job?”

Tatsuya set the conversation off.

“Yes. About the attack you incurred a few days in Nara and the rest. You were not injured?”

“I am fine. Miyuki and the others did not receive even the lightest wound. I am thankful for your concern.”

“That is good. Well, fellows of that level don’t have much of a chance to slow Tatsuya down. By the way, have you identified those people?”

“I do not know how reliable it is at this point. There’s interference in my access to the military information division, I cannot investigate the details.”

“Hoo, the information division.”

They were exchanging jabs mixed with truth and lies. Tatsuya was not telling him everything he knew and Hayama was also probably concealing things. No, if it was limited to this conversation, it was more like Hayama hadn’t said anything.

“I am sorry. But for that reason, I have not made enough progress that I am able to give you a report.”

“No, no. Both Oku-sama and myself view securing the cooperation of the Kudou Clan as a major accomplishment in itself.”

Tatsuya observed Hayama’s face as much as he could get away with without being rude. Was the line about Maya being impressed, the truth or mere lip service; it was unfortunate but, the power of Tatsuya’s eyes were unable to determine that.

“So, it would be fine for me to assume that my progress toward the current objective is satisfactory?”

“It is sufficient.”

For now, he had secured freedom of movement; for Tatsuya, that was nothing but good.

“On the Kuroba front, have they acquired any new information?”

“There are no developments there.”

The shortest answer possible perhaps to keep from granting Tatsuya any material to make conjectures from. Those distrustful thoughts floated across Tatsuya’s mind.

“Well, Tatsuya-dono. I will be going now, I will tell Oku-sama what you said in order to ask her honored opinion.”

“Huh”, that was probably to be expected. There was no way it would end with him only asking about the progress of the investigation.

“Regarding Oku-sama, shall she hear from me that Tatsuya-dono does not require reinforcements.”

“Reinforcements, hmm……”

Those words were outside his calculations so Tatsuya could not immediately reply. Maya sending him reinforcements was not something, Tatsuya had even considered.

However, this is a good opportunity, thought Tatsuya. He had actually intended to have someone dispatched from Mikitsugu’s area secretly from Maya or Hayama but, taking advantage of a request to Maya for reinforcements was probably the best way to avoid future trouble.

“Hayama-san. When the notice of this duty was delivered were Fumiya and his sister directed to purposely overlook a tail?”

Hayama cocked his head with a serious face at Tatsuya’s words.

“Really? I gave no such directive but……”

Hayama didn’t appear befuddled. However, there had been such a directive that was clear from looking at the resulting situation.

“Ahh, come to think of it, Hanabishi-kun struck up a conversation with Fumiya-dono about something.”

“Hanabishi-san, hmm.”

A Yotsuba Clan employee of the second rank. A magician that the Yotsuba had headhunted from outside, His magical power was ordinary but he was a former serviceman with extensive combat experience. He was in charge of fine tuning scheduling and providing equipment for illegal operations related to magic requested by the Yotsuba Clan. Another way to put it would be he was the butler that served as the Yotsuba’s control tower.

“However, I believe Hanabishi-san would not issue such a directive on his own initiative.”

“I am sorry. Not even I know more than that.”

That was a lie. Maya’s trusted retainer would not be unaware of such an important matter as information concerning Tatsuya and Miyuki being leaked. Never mind Tatsuya, Miyuki was a candidate to be the next clan head.

However, he had declared that “I do not know” which left Tatsuya no way of pressing him further. Tatsuya changed his attack plan.

“I see. Nevertheless, I believe Fumiya was unmistakably followed. Man made Spirits were able to investigate our home and we were attacked in the area in front of the station”

“Something like that… Tatsuya-dono, it’s inexcusable. I will listen to Hanabishi-kun’s explanation.”

“No, since what’s done is done, it does not really matter, however…”

“Then?”

“As a matter of fact, underlings of the Traditionalist have been haunting the vicinity of classmates of mine and Miyuki.”

“Hmm… That would be worrying for Tatsuya-dono and Miyuki-sama as well.”

“Yes. For now, I have been coping with it through the good will of the Kitayama family and the Kyuuchou temple but can you recommend to Oba-ue that she lend me a hand.”

“I see, freeing oneself from worry is a standard tactic. Maya-sama would also wish you to be free of hindrances.”

“Please. I do not wish to take up more of the Master’s time.”

The unspoken implication of that statement was the threat that more of Yakumo’s intervention will be permitted which could cause problems, Hayama should understand that. Tatsuya thought that both the Yotsuba and Yakumo should understand that he wanted this for both their sakes but, he did not state that openly.

“By the way, Tatsuya-dono, about Kyuuchou temple.”

Hayama abruptly changed the topic, this might be his way of proclaiming that he did not wish to pursue the issue further.

“Recently, you have been engaged in developing new magic at the Kyuuchou temple, Tatsuya-dono.”

“You are well informed.”

The surprise that showed on Tatsuya’s face was not an act. When the heck did they find out, by what means, Tatsuya had absolutely no idea.

“Simple deduction. We have information regarding what is inside the basement of Kyuuchou temple.”

“I see, so that was what is called a trick question.”

Tatsuya showed an expression of regret but that was an act. He was relieved now that he knew his information concealment hadn’t been penetrated and it was a good time to reveal the development of his new magic anyway. This could be called a good opportunity to do what was known as lobbing a ball to keep a runner on base.

“It is as you have said I have borrowed the basement of the Kyuuchou temple to engage in the creation of a new attack magic.”

“Do you mind if I inquire as to what type?”

“Of course not. I have no secrets from Oba-ue.”

Tatsuya’s face proclaimed his innocence as he answered Hayama’s question with a bold face lie.

“The magic I am in the midst of developing is a close range physical attack spell. I believe you have gone through the report concerning the Brionac used by Angie Sirius of the Stars?”

“So you are trying to reproduce the Brionac?”

“There are minor differences in the theory but that is the basic concept. The truth is I had a match at First High in April with an opponent on whom Mist Dispersion wouldn’t work.”

“The Tomitsuka Clan’s Range Zero?”

“So you are aware of it. I had an epiphany then. As Miyuki’s Guardian, I urgently need a repulsion magic for use against opponents on whom ‘decomposition’ will not work.”

Perhaps, Tatsuya’s feeling resonated with him, Hayama bowed his head deeply in agreement.

“An excellent endeavour.”

“If this magic is perfected, I should probably not only be able to pierce the psion armor of ‘Range Zero’ but the Juumonji Clan’s ‘Phalanx’. I think I will be able to unveil it at the next Shougatsu[50].”

For an instant, Hayama sunk into silence with a grave look. But his gentle “butler’s smile” was restored so quickly that one would think that had been an illusion.

“Is the name of the magic been decided, yet?”

“It has not been perfected yet, so only a temporary one……”

“If you may.”

“When it is completed for unveiling, I intend to give it the name ‘Baryon Lance’.”

“……How interesting. I will look forward to being able to see it with Miyuki-sama at Shougatsu.”

As he spoke, Hayama got up.

Tatsuya also felt it was a suitable time.

“So on the matter of guarding our school friends, please take care of it.”

“Please perform your duties with dispatch as well, Tatsuya-dono.”

Tatsuya made a bow to Hayama and left the interview room.

The shaking of hands did not exist between these two.




October 15th, Monday.

First High was deep in the middle of the tumult of preparing for the Thesis Competition which covered a different commotion.

The news that the former student council president and the eldest daughter of the Saegusa Clan of the Ten Master Clans, Saegusa Mayumi had requested a meeting with Shiba Tatsuya had captured the interest of the students.

In the midst of the students irresponsibly exchanging rumors, there were many students who were unable to take the news with a calm heart.

Like the former chairman Hattori Gyobu.

Or the student council treasurer Mitsui Honoka.

And Miyuki who was both the student council president and Tatsuya’s sister who felt an indescribable uneasiness as she watched the pair disappear into the reception room.





Afterword




As always, to those who picked up this book, I offer my gratitude from the depths of my heart. To the first timers, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, and if this is not your first time, I thank you for following this series.

How was the Volume after the long break? I felt slightly fresh and as I played with the keyboard I believed that the length was appropriate. I materialized the kind of story that I wanted, in order to build some mood. I’m satisfied because I experienced that I could “delve more” into the story.

Contrary to the initial schedule, this Ancient City Insurrection saga is now divided into Volumes 14 and 15, and conceived as the authentic entry into play and full participation of Kudou Minoru, a very important character in this series. Please wait for Volume 15 as the conclusion of this fight against another important player in this story.

In addition, though not originally intended, Volume 14 turned out to be the “Nara chapter” while Volume 15 will be the “Kyoto chapter”. Speaking of narrative, I tried that Nara’s scenes were as descriptive as possible, but I think it will be harder for me to depict the local landscape in Kyoto, but I’ll do my best.

Concerning the side story of the second year 9SC that I mentioned in the afterword of Volume 13, I plan to start it by the end of the year. I apologize in advance if I don’t publish it soon or you feel it becomes a hindrance in the story development (SFX: *forehead sweat drop*). I’ll do my best here also.

By all means, please enjoy both these books and the Anime collectively. The books are already in the stores and the Anime already in Blue-ray format. However, there are parts in the books not depicted in the Anime. I think enjoying them together is more fun (SFX: LOL).

With that, hope we’ll meet again in the next volume, “Ancient City Insurrection Volume 15”

Please look forward to the series even from here on.

Notes




Ikoma (生駒市): Is a city located in the northwestern end of Nara Prefecture, Japan. The city was founded on November 1, 1971.

As of September 1, 2014, the city has an estimated population of 199,390, with 48,625 households. Population density of 2,262.20 persons per km², and it is the third biggest population in the prefecture. The total area is 53.18 km². The city is a famous “Chasen” town.

Keihanshin Region: Encompassing Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe.

Mount Ikoma: Is a mountain on the border of Nara Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture in Japan. This mountain is the highest peak in the Ikoma Mountains and the height is 642 meters.



Mount Higashiyama: The approximate location should be about here.

Bishōnen (美少年): Is a Japanese term literally meaning “beautiful youth (boy)” and describes an aesthetic that can be found in disparate areas in East Asia: a young man whose beauty (and sexual appeal) transcends the boundary of gender or sexual orientation. It has always shown the strongest manifestation in Japanese pop culture, gaining in popularity due to the androgynous glam rock bands of the 1970s, but it has roots in ancient Japanese literature, the homosocial and homoerotic ideals of the medieval Chinese imperial court and intellectuals, and Indian aesthetic concepts carried over from Hinduism, imported with Buddhism to China. Today, bishōnen are very popular among girls and women in Japan. Reasons for this social phenomenon may include the unique male and female social relationships found within the genre. Some have theorized that bishōnen provide a non-traditional outlet for gender relations. Moreover, it breaks down stereotypes surrounding feminine male characters. These are often depicted with very strong martial arts abilities, sports talent, high intelligence, dandy fashion, or comedic flair, traits that are usually assigned to the hero/protagonist.

Bishōjo (美少女): Is a Japanese term used to refer to beautiful young girls, usually below young adult age. Bishōjo is not listed as a word in the prominent Japanese dictionary (Kōjien). A variant of the word, biyōjo (美幼女) refers to a beautiful girl before the age of adolescence.

Keigo: Or respectful attitude (courtesy/formality) towards superiors.

Translator’s Note: She didn’t modify her keigo, just changed the honorific to kun, keeping her Ojou-sama stance.

Translator’s Note: There’s a clank at the end of Minami’s speech.

Translator’s Note: An Ojou-sama.

Translator’s Note: Minami’s “Keigo” is stronger than that of the siblings.

Heian Period (平安時代): Is the last division of classical Japanese history, running from 794 to 1185. The period is named after the capital city of Heian-kyō, or modern Kyōto. It is the period in Japanese history when Buddhism, Taoism and other Chinese influences were at their height. The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court and noted for its art, especially poetry and literature. Although the Imperial House of Japan had power on the surface, the real power was in the hands of the Fujiwara clan, a powerful aristocratic family who had intermarried with the imperial family. Many emperors actually had mothers from the Fujiwara family. Heian (平安) means “peace” in Japanese.

Katsuragi Kodō: Is an ancient path with lots of historic and archaeological remains. People go mainly to recall ancient times and strolling in an autumnal atmosphere (No Wiki link, but note that Lisa is translating the JP). PDF (404)

Nara Basin: Lies to the East of these mountains, contains the highest concentration of population in Nara Prefecture. Further East are the Kasagi Mountains, which separate the Basin from the Yamato Highlands.

Translator’s Notes: Kuhonji, Hitokotonushi, and Takamahiko are very well renowned shrines in the Gose (Nara) area (No EN page, but you can always Google translate for more details).

Takakamo Shrine:

Click here for more details.

Hakama (袴): Are a type of traditional Japanese clothing. Trousers were used by the Chinese imperial court in the Sui and Tang dynasties, and this style was adopted by the Japanese in the form of hakama beginning in the sixth century. Hakama are tied at the waist and fall approximately to the ankles. They are worn over a kimono (hakamashita).

There are two types of hakama, divided umanori (馬乗り, literally horse-riding hakama) and undivided andon bakama (行灯袴, lit., lantern hakama). The umanori type have divided legs, similar to trousers. Both these types appear similar. A “mountain” or “field” type of umanori hakama was traditionally worn by field or forest workers. They are looser in the waist and narrower in the leg.



Hakama are secured by four straps (himo): two longer himo attached on either side of the front of the garment, and two shorter himo attached on either side of the rear. The rear of the garment has a rigid trapezoidal section, called a koshi-ita (腰板). Below that on the inside is a hakama-dome (袴止め)[citation needed] (a spoon-shaped component sometimes referred to as a hera) which is tucked into the obi or himo at the rear, and helps to keep the hakama in place.



Hakama have seven deep pleats, two on the back and five on the front. The pleats are said to represent the seven virtues of bushido, considered essential to the samurai way. Although they appear balanced, the arrangement of the front pleats (three to the right, two to the left) is asymmetrical, and as such is an example of asymmetry in Japanese aesthetics.

Translator’s Note: The Shrine name (Takakamo, 高鴨, High Duck) and his last name (鴨野, Kamono, Duck Field) have the same root (鴨, Kamo, Duck), so it’d be like a Family shrine, which is what Tatsuya notices.

The Kamo Clan (賀茂氏): Is a Japanese sacerdotal kin group which traces its roots from a Yayoi period shrine in the vicinity of northeastern Kyoto. The clan rose to prominence during the Asuka and Heian periods when the Kamo are identified with the 7th-century founding of the Kamo Shrine.

Translator’s Note: There are several Kamo shrines (EN,JP) throughout Japan. In the Takakamo link can be confirmed that it’s the headquarters of the Kamo shrines. Provided both links because inexplicably the EN links do not mention the Takakamo shrine.

Kashihara Shrine (橿原神宮): Is a Shinto shrine located in the city of Kashihara, Nara Prefecture, Japan. Kashihara Shrine was built in 1889 at the site of the Kashihara-gū where Japan’s first emperor, Emperor Jimmu, is said to have acceded to the throne.



Ishibutai Kofun (石舞台古墳): Is a stone kofun tumulus of the Asuka period in the east of Shimanoshō, Asuka, Nara Prefecture, Japan. The kofun is believed to be the tomb of Soga no Umako. It occupies a space of 54 m (177 ft), and is the largest known megalithic structure in Japan. The kofun is also known as the Ishibutoya (石太屋) Kofun.

Soga no Umako (蘇我 馬子, 551 - June 19, 626) was the son of Soga no Iname and a member of the powerful Soga clan of Japan.



Umako conducted political reforms with Prince Shōtoku during the rules of Emperor Bidatsu and Empress Suiko and established the Soga clan’s stronghold in the government by having his daughter married with members of the imperial family.



In the late 6th century, Soga no Umako went to great lengths to promote Buddhism in Japan. At that time, the Soga clan employed the immigrants from China and Korea, and obtained a high technology and knowledge. Soga no Umako, who made the acceptance of Buddhism, defeated Mononobe no Moriya in the Battle of Shigisen, and secured Soga dominance. On January 15, 593, Relics of Buddha Shakyamuni were deposited inside the foundation stone under the pillar of a pagoda at Asuka-dera (Hōkō-ji at the time), a temple which Umako ordered to construct, according to the Suiko section of the Nihongi.

Mount Wakakusa-yama (Mikasa-yama): Mount Wakakusa-yama is also called “Mikasa-yama” (Three-shade mountain) since the mountain looks like three round-shape shades are piled up. Like Nara Park, there are many wild deers walking here.

The 342 meters high mountain is coverd with grass which is burnt every year on the night of 4th Saturday of January by fires lighted here and there at its foot. It is called “Yamayaki”, which means burning of dead grass on mountain slopes. You can enjoy the panoramic view of Nara Basin from the top of the mountain. Source: Hello Japan.

Tōdai-ji: Is a Buddhist temple complex, that was once one of the powerful Seven Great Temples, located in the city of Nara, Japan. Its Great Buddha Hall (大仏殿 Daibutsuden), houses the world’s largest bronze statue of the Buddha Vairocana, known in Japanese simply as Daibutsu (大仏). The temple also serves as the Japanese headquarters of the Kegon school of Buddhism. The temple is a listed UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the “Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara”, together with seven other sites including temples, shrines and places in the city of Nara. Deer, regarded as messengers of the gods in the Shinto religion, roam the grounds freely.



Kasuga-taisha: Is a Shinto shrine in the city of Nara, in Nara Prefecture, Japan. Established in 768 AD and rebuilt several times over the centuries, it is the shrine of the Fujiwara family. The interior is famous for its many bronze lanterns, as well as the many stone lanterns that lead up the shrine.

The architectural style Kasuga-zukuri takes its name from Kasuga Shrine’s honden (sanctuary).



Kasuga Shrine, and the Kasugayama Primeval Forest near it, are registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the “Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara”.



The path to Kasuga Shrine passes through Deer Park. In Deer Park, deer are able to roam freely and are believed to be sacred messengers of the Shinto gods that inhabit the shrine and surrounding mountainous terrain. Kasuga Shrine and the deer have been featured in several paintings and works of art of the Nambokucho Period. Over three thousand stone lanterns line the way. The Man’yo Botanical Garden, Nara is adjacent to the shrine.

Socratic Ignorance: He among you is the wisest who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is really worth nothing at all. (Apology 23b, tr. Church, rev. Cumming) - That the wisest of you men is he who like Socrates has learned that with respect to wisdom, he is truly worthless. (tr. Tredennick) - He, O men, is the wisest who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing. (tr. Jowett) - This man among you, mortals, is wisest who, like Socrates, understands that his wisdom is worthless. (tr. Grube)



What does it mean? Socrates spoke with a man who was said by many to be wise, but found that this man had no more wisdom than Socrates had, [and that the man even became angry when Socrates showed him that this was so,] and therefore Socrates concluded that “it seems that I am wiser than he is to this small extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know” More details here.

Ukigumo Shrine: More info here.

Edanomiya Shrine: Another subordinate shrine of Kasuga-taisha.

浮雲神社（春日大社末社）: The information on these 2 shrines can also be found here.

Kagutsuchi (カグツチ): Kagu-tsuchi’s birth burned his mother Izanami, causing her death. His father Izanagi, in his grief, beheaded Kagu-tsuchi with his sword, Ame no Ohabari (天之尾羽張), and cut his body into eight pieces, which became eight volcanoes. The blood that dripped off Izanagi’s sword created a number of deities, including the sea god Watatsumi and rain god Kuraokami.



Kagu-tsuchi’s birth, in Japanese mythology, comes at the end of the creation of the world and marks the beginning of death. In the Engishiki, a source which contains the myth, Izanami, in her death throes, bears the water god Mizuhame, instructing her to pacify Kagu-tsuchi if he should become violent. This story also contains references to traditional fire-fighting tools: gourds for carrying water and wet clay and water reeds for smothering fires.

Takemikazuchi (建御雷 or 武甕槌, “Brave-Awful-Possessing” or “Thunder-God”): Is a deity in Japanese mythology, considered a god of thunder and sword god. He also competed in what is considered the first sumo wrestling match recorded in mythology.

He is otherwise known as Kashima-no-kami, the chief deity revered of the Kashima Shrine at Kashima, Ibaraki (and all other subsidiary Kashima shrines). In the namazu-e or catfish pictures of the Edo Period, Takemikazuchi/Kashima is depicted attempting to subdue the giant catfish supposedly dwelling at the kaname-ishi (要石 “pinning rock”) of the Japanese land-mass and causing its earthquakes. (See image above).

Futsunushi (経津主神): In Japanese mythology is a kami of swords, thus his Shinto priests are supposed to always wear Nihontō with them, at least in the shrine. He is a general for Amaterasu along with Takemikazuchi. He is worshipped at Katori Shrine, and as he is seen as a god of martial arts, Katori Shintō-ryū adepts make a solemn oath when they join the school.

Ame-no-Koyane (天児屋命 or 天児屋根命): A male deity, he is considered the “First in Charge of Divine Affairs”, as well as the aide to the first Emperor of Japan. He is also considered to be the ancestor of the Fujiwara family.

Himegami: A Shinto God.

Zawari (ザワリ): Is a SFX for moving leaves in a forest.

Flechette: Is a pointed steel projectile, with a vaned tail for stable flight. The name comes from French fléchette, “little arrow” or “dart”, and sometimes retains the acute accent in English: fléchette.

In WWI, darts, also known as flechettes were dropped from aircraft to attack infantry.

Zone Interference (領域干渉): Is one of the common means of disabling the opponent’s magic by using the user’s own Magic Power to nullify opposing magic. By casting magic without a defined event-modification, it is anti-magic solely for the sake of disabling other magic. Since the magic has no target, the technique designates a fixed area with the caster at its center as the caster’s “zone”. This doesn’t bring about a change in information, or Eidos, of anything within the zone, but instead creates a threshold for any spell or technique that seeks to change the Eidos within the zone to overcome in order to take effect. If the interference strength of any subsequent spell cast by the opponent is less than the interference strength of the initial caster, then the effects of the spell do not take place.



Zone Interference does not reverse magic, but rather directly prevents the opponents’ magic in this manner. As such, existing phenomena will continue, but will not be sustained by magic. Zone Interference is indiscriminate in that it does not just apply to the opponent’s magic, but applies to any magic of the caster’s allies as well. Zone Interference works only on magic that seeks to alter the Eidos, so it is powerless against Non-Systematic magic.

Slithering Thunders (Thunder Snake Path): Like “Dry Blizzard”, stones of dry ice are produced and water vapor is condensed. This combination magic utilizes Oscillation-System and Dispersion-System Magic to melt the ice, creating a fog of carbon dioxide which has a high electrical conductivity through which a static charge is run through.

Oniyarai-jutsu (追儺術): Chant to chase evil spirits away.

Dielectrical Breakdown: Or Electrical breakdown is a long reduction in the resistance of an electrical insulator when the voltage applied across it exceeds the breakdown voltage. This results in the insulator becoming electrically conductive. Electrical breakdown may be a momentary event (as in an electrostatic discharge), or may lead to a discontinuous arc charge if protective devices fail to interrupt the current in a low power circuit.

Under sufficient electrical stress, electrical breakdown can occur within solids, liquids, gases or vacuum. However, the specific breakdown mechanisms are significantly different for each, particularly in different kinds of dielectric medium.

Kuda-kitsune: Or sometimes referred to as Kanko is a creature that resembles a fox spirit familiar.

According to the Zen’an Zuihitsu (善庵随筆) the kanko is a fox the size of a weasel or rat, with vertical eyes and thin hair. The magic-user summons the kanko to appear inside a bamboo pipe he is holding, whereupon the fox will answer all the questions it is asked. The origin of this practice is traced back to a yamabushi who obtained this art while undergoing strict asceticism on Mount Kinpu. These Kanko are said to be numerous in the northern mountains of Suruga, Tōtōmi, and Mikawa Provinces.

Translator’s Note: Miyuki actually does say “please” but she uses the less polite form like when you address your employees in Japan.

The Moon in the Water: The mirror of the water-moon image has JP literary-cultural allusions rooted in the three Divine Treasures: Mirror, Sword, and Jewel. Miyuki makes reference to the mirror which suggests a meaning of “unstained mind”, “source of honesty” and “hiding nothing”. Read “The Moon in the Water: Understanding Tanizaki, Kawabata, and Mishima” by Gwenn Boardman Petersen for more info.

Heijō-kyō: Was the capital city of Japan during most of the Nara period, from 710–40 and again from 745–84. The imperial palace is a listed UNESCO World Heritage together with other places in the city of Nara.

Empress Gemmei ordered the Imperial capital moved from Fujiwara-kyō to Heijō-kyō in 708, and the move to Heijō-kyō was complete in 710. Heijō-kyō was modeled after Chang’an, the capital of Tang Dynasty China, although Heijō-kyō lacked walls. In the city, merchants and traders from China, Korea and India introduced various foreign cultures to Heijō-kyō through the Silk Road. As a result, Heijō-kyō flourished as Japan’s first international and political capital, with a peak population of approximately 100,000. The overall form of the city was an irregular rectangle, and the area of city is more than 25 km2.

Tatami-room Table: Small low table widely used in Japan.



Biku (ビクッ), Zoku (ゾクッ): The former is an SFX for tremble of surprise while the latter is SFX for tremble of fear.

Kurari (クラリ): SFX for dizzy.

Okaerinasai (お帰りなさい, Welcome back): Is used when someone returns to some physical place (usually home) and it’s the proper response to Tadaima (ただいま, I have come back).

Japanese New Year (正月): Is an annual festival with its own customs. Since 1873, the official Japanese New Year has been celebrated according to the Gregorian calendar, on January 1 of each year, New Year’s Day (元日 Ganjitsu). However, the celebration of the traditional Japanese New Year is still marked on the same day as the contemporary Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese New Years.

The kadomatsu is a traditional decoration for the new year holiday.

Osechi-ryōri, typical new year’s dishes



Japanese people eat a selection of dishes during the New Year celebration called osechi-ryōri (御節料理 or お節料理), typically shortened to osechi. Many of these dishes are sweet, sour, or dried, so they can keep without refrigeration—the culinary traditions date to a time before households had refrigerators, when most stores closed for the holidays. There are many variations of osechi, and some foods eaten in one region are not eaten in other places (or are considered unfortunate or even banned) on New Year’s Day. Another popular dish is ozōni (お雑煮), a soup with mochi rice cake and other ingredients that differ based on various regions of Japan. Today, sashimi and sushi are often eaten, as well as non-Japanese foods. To let the overworked stomach rest, seven-herb rice soup (七草粥 nanakusa-gayu) is prepared on the seventh day of January, a day known as jinjitsu (人日).
