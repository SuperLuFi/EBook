[One]



It was an unheard of event.



June 18th 2097, early in the morning on Tuesday.



An uproar was created by a members of STARS, a magical unit under the direct command of the Joint Staff Headquarters of the USNA Army, at the STARS headquarters located on the outskirts of Roswell, New Mexico.



This wasn't a one man job. STARS are divided into twelve units, and each unit has a First Class Star Captain.



Three of the twelve units caused unrest and were led by their Commander.



Luckily, only a few senior officers participated in the uprising. But this did not lessen the situation.



◇ ◇ ◇



Lina came to Japan 71 hours ago.



At the STARS headquarters, where Lina had escaped from, the battle between the STARS members was still going on.



STARS classify their soldiers as First-Class Stars, Second-Class Stars, Constellations, Planetary and Satellite Class. Members of STARS, who are the strongest, focus more on fighting than on magic.



Those who tried to kill Lina were - Captain of the 3rd Unit, Alexander Arcturus, First Lieutenant of the 3rd Unit, Jacob Regulus, Captain of the 4th Unit Charlotte Vega, and Second-Lieutenant of the 4th Unit, Leila Deneb.



Those who helped Lina escape were - Major Benjamin Canopus, Second-Lieutenant Ralph Algol, and Second-Lieutenant Ralph Hardy Mirfak.



Among them, Mirfak had left the base with her, using the prototype for a Flying Car.



Therefore Canopus was facing three people, Arcturus, Regulus and Vega.



And Deneb, who was pursuing Lina until she escaped, was busy with Algol.



"Leila!"





Deneb was going after Algol after she fell from the loading platform of the prototype, which was carrying Lina. Vega screamed when she saw Lina leave. She also jumped out into the street to go after her, who had escaped from the warehouse storing the prototype, but she could not ignore Canopus and remained here.



"Major Canopus! Don't you know that Major Sirius is a traitor?"



Canopus didn’t know if those lines from Vega were used to confuse him, or because she seriously believed this. He thought that these were probably the last of the parasites, but that was only him guessing.



Second Lieutenant of the 11th Unit, Ariana Lee Shaula claimed that members from the 3rd, 6th and 11th Unit, excluding herself, had become parasites. She was saved because of her mental defence due to her affinity with Mental Interference Type magic. As part of this, her ability to notice parasitic magic waves was also high. Canopus thought her guess was reliable.



As Shaula said, Vega and Deneb of the 4th Unit are not parasites. But if this uprising is led by a parasite, Vega, who isn’t a parasite, was still likely to listen to this information.



It's no secret that Vega is not friendly with Lina. Many of STARS also understand that this is due to jealousy.



It may be because of the influence of Vega, but Lieutenant Deneb from the 4th Unit also rebelled against Lina. Likewise, Lieutenant Spica from the 4th Unit does not take such a blatant position as Vega and Deneb, but it was not so difficult to see that their internal thoughts are similar.



Perhaps this feeling was being exploited.



Military personnel should not act through sympathy. Personnel is trained to be tough at any time.



However, people are weak to their own interests.



If a good reason is given, someone will easily be deceived.



He may not have had the same emotions as them, but he could understand the source of their reaction.



It wasn’t easy for Canopus to understand this, but he had seen many examples of it before.



"A Captain should not say that a Major betrayed STARS! Captain Vega, your actions are worrying!”



Therefore, through replying to Vega, he expressed that they were not being convincing.



Vega's answer was ‘Double Press’, a Weight Type magic. This is a magic that can apply pressure from two different directions at the same time and is usually used on opposite sides in order to compress a target from both sides. Canopus countered using ‘Press’, also a Weight Type magic, thus defeated Vega’s magic. Instead of canceling the magic itself, he defeated the other's magic by identifying the magic and conflicting the event by modifying it..



"... ..."



A surprised sound came out of the Vega’s mouth. Reversing the effect of magic of the enemy by making its definition fail are included in the training of STARS. Of course she knew that. However, in order to deliberately create a ‘faulty definition’, it is necessary to read the enemy’s magic and accurately predict the magic used by the enemy, either by releasing magic at the appropriate coordinates or by using the enemy.



The first, albeit not very precise, requires some difficulty.



The latter means that he needs to read the enemy, that is, to accurately follow and know what they are doing.



The surprise that Vega showed was an opportunity for Canopus.



To stop Vega, Canopus closed the gap between them. He didn’t want to cut her using ‘Molecular Divider’, but to deprive her of her freedom using a blow at close range.



But Canopus stopped at his fourth step.



Having just enough time to look behind him, he put up a ‘Mirror Shield’ diagonally behind him.



His shield works against high-energy weapons like the laser light bullet fired by Regulus.



The laser bullet he reflected caught Regulus's face.



Shocked, he could feel the cold sweat on his back.



Regulus was in a hurry and moved with his armed device.



Until now, Regulus had not been actively attacked by Canopus. Was Canopus unable to find Regulus' location or was he simply prioritising Vega or Arcturus?



Regulus attacks with a sniper.



However, the current Regulus is under pressure.



Regulus’ specialty is "laser sniping". When using this ability to shoot a shot, the enemy magician knows where he is. Immediately after an attack, the risk of being discovered by the enemy is the same as when firing live ammunition, but it is less dense than ordinary magic, making it capable to be shot from far away, even to the point where the eyes can’t see.



Regulus understands the flaw in his magic well. Every time he shot, he needs to run away from that place with a rifle-shaped weapon.



It was true that he hadn’t gotten attacked, except by Canopus’ counterattack.



But this counterattack weakened his mind.



The light bullet that hit Canopus' 'Mirror Shield', has long since been cancelled by Regulus.



Regulus had to calm down.



Needless to say, laser light moves at the speed of light. The time it takes between departure and arrival is practically zero, and it is already too late to block or reflect the laser using a shield if it has already been shot.



There are two types of shields against energy bullets.



One blocks energy above a certain amount. This is the usual type.



The other reflects electromagnetic waves. ‘Mirror Shield’ is this type.



For laser bullets, the latter is more effective. ‘Mirror Shield’ reflects only the light that is coming in, it doesn’t do anything with the light going out. Even the usual anti-energy shield will not interfere with the attacks of ‘Laser sniping’.



In principle, it is possible to block the bullets of energy, by using ‘Mirror Shield’ immediately before shooting. ‘Laser Sniping’ has an inevitable temporary lag because of the initial Magic Invocation. So if you deploy Mirror Shield right after activating Laser Sniping, it can be blocked.



Lina's ‘Mirror Shield’ is capable of deflecting projectiles straight to the ground in order to spare allies from being hit by the recoil. Canopus’ ‘Mirror Shield’ is able to reflect the projectiles at nearly a 180-degree angle. The reason why the angle of reflection is not clear is because there is a bit of ‘movement’ in magic. If it were to be described in degrees, it would be something like ‘180 degrees plus or minus three degrees’. If there was no movement, Regulus would have been hit.



He felt fear of being shot by the laser he fired.



This was gradually damaging Regulus’ mental strength.



Lieutenant Leila Deneb and Captain Ralph Algor from the First Unit were having a martial art match in a place two hundred meters from the storehouse where Canopus and Vega were located. Deneb jumped on the vehicle that was carrying Lina, by using Movement Type magic, but was blocked by Algol, who was hiding on the loading dock, and they both fell on various types of joints.



Deneb and Algor almost simultaneously got up and began a useless battle without asking any questions. Deneb believes that Algor is collaborating with the ‘Traitorous Sirius’ ─ which is true except for the ‘Traitorous’ part ─ So Deneb's judgment was not mistaken, which is what he was thinking. Algol was satisfied and didn’t pay any attention to any other enemies or his allies, just on his fight.



Deneb aimed with the gun in his right hand and pulled the trigger.



But at that moment Algol was no longer in his line of fire. He had instantly turned the distance of ten meters into zero, capturing the knife that Deneb held.



Algol grabbed the big combat knife. The knife had a blade that was about 30 centimeters long and unlike a survival knife, this one’s thick top had no ordinary shape. The long handle was curved at the top, to attach itself to the opponent’s knife.



Deneb and Algol both prefer the same type of magic battles.



They were well prepared for the battle, using high speed Movement Type Magic. And Deneb was already levitating using magic.



This is a flight magic technique developed by Taurus Silver. Flying magic is a technique that allowed free flight, continuing to periodically activate Gravity Control Type magic in less than one second. STARS applied this to their Movement Type magic.



When constantly activating Movement Type magic in a very short time. If the destination of the movement is not defined, the Movement Type magic is automatically destroyed without showing any of its effects but this Gravity Control magic can carry the user along a linear trajectory in whichever direction the user wants to move. With this technology, STARS managed to solve the problem of CAD delays that prevents sudden movement from which the melee magician suffers.



Thus, Deneb, who was in a state where she could move at any time with the help of this technique, could have been hit if she had thought about attacking Algol. However, Deneb got Algol’s knife in the blade guard held in her left hand.



Even if she stepped back using Movement Type Magic, Algor, using the same technology, would catch her in the next moment. She also thought that it would still be difficult, even if she avoided it. But more than that, warlike feelings prevailed in Deneb.



Deneb believed in the betrayal of Lina from the bottom of her heart. She was desperately disgusted with Lina's name ‘Sirius’.



The title ‘Sirius’ is a symbol of The Military Magician of the USNA. The betrayal of Sirius is a disgrace to the pride of a magician belonging to the USNA troops. Deneb was incredibly angry, but was also misunderstanding the situation.



Deneb aimed her pistol at Algol.



Algol's left hand stretched, and Deneb's pistol was caught between the blade of the knife and the handle of the knife held in the other hand. A forward-curved long handle usually wasn’t seen in a normal combat knife.



Before Algol could get to her wrist, Deneb freed her hand from his grip.



Deneb retreated a few meters before letting the gun fall to the ground.



Algor had a surprised voice and told her,



"What is this!"



"Ha ha ha ha! I guess a knife can also be used like that!"



A knife with a long handle is a special object, used to intercept the attacks of the enemy.



Algol was focused on the knife.



"But this is!"



“Ha ha ha ha ha! A half gun, half knife! ”



Algol moved, leaving residual images behind. The next moment he appeared on the side of Deneb.



Algol cut diagonally with his knife.



Deneb's right hand was empty. She tried to catch Algol with the knife in her left hand.



The left hand of Algol delicately changed its trajectory.



He deliberately faced his knife to that of Deneb’s.



Getting rid of the knife and making it useless.



The tip of the knife, which Algol had in his right hand, pointed at Deneb’s left flank, which has become wounded.



Deneb's face was horrified.



Canopus was unable to observe the battle of his subordinates. Even if he knew the situation, helping them is impossible.



At the moment, the situation was chaotic. Being one on three, they did not want to waste their numerical advantage.



Negate the Gravity Type magic by using the same magic.



Reflect Regulus’ ‘Laser Sniping’ using ‘Mirror Shield’.



Intercepting Arcturus’ 'Dancing Blades' with 'Molecular Divider'.



Violent face-to-face fighting continues with the three First-Class members.



It was a tough battle, even with the skill of Canopus.



If it were a real war, he might not have had any difficulties so far.



If Canopus was serious, he could have already won.



Although Captains have the same basic abilities, Major Canopus and Captain Vega differ in their Class abilities. Canopus is a man who was supposed to be stronger than even the previous Sirius in the event of a battle on land. Vega has no chance of winning a direct fight, in which each other's figure is visible. In fact, Vega's face had already been unclearly hidden ever since his fight against Lina.



Regulus was also an opponent of Canopus: "He cannot be ignored, but he is not a significant threat."



The ‘Laser Sniping’ used by Regulus has a structural flaw that takes about one second from activation to launch.



And Regulus also happens to rarely use other magic besides ‘Laser Sniping’. While Regulus does narrow down the range of tactics that he can use, if you use Canopus’ skill, it is not difficult to simultaneously confront Vega.



Even when fighting Regulus and Vega, and with the handicap that ‘He Can't Fight Seriously’, this battle would have ended in a victory for Canopus in a short time. But that would be true if it was only the two of them.



Arcturus was a powerful enemy.



Captain of the 3rd Unit, Alexander Arcturus. A Magician who acquired both the modern magic of STARS and the Ancient Magic of the indigenous peoples of North America — both with high affinity. Although he could not use Spirit Magic because he was assimilated with the parasite, he received a net gain in fighting power, by completely using the force of the parasite.



Canopus blocked the light bullets of Regulus and urgently went after Vega.



However, Canopus was forced to retreat by a strong wind.



This was because of Arcturus.



The killing power is low. Although this is magic aimed at destroying the enemy's position, in order to escape from a local gust of wind with a diameter of 2 meters and 60 meters per second, Canopus had to dodge by more than 5 meters.



Going after the dodging Canopus, was not an arrow, but something more dangerous.



‘Dancing Blades’ made from obsidian, are sharply designed and shaped.



Usually, Dancing Blades uses an embedded knife-shaped CAD. That is why it is so easy and accurate that you can do it with a single Magic Activation.



But this does not mean that the weapons used for Dancing Blades is limited to CADs. The one creating the magic is the magician, not the CAD. This is an absolute principle that does not change in any magic.



First, ‘Dancing Blades’ is a magic that uses the weight of the object to make it move, and any weapon that has this can be used. It doesn’t even have to be a knife. Realistically, even a stone on the side of the road could be the ‘bullet’ of the ‘Dancing Blades’.



Four object simultaneously came to Canopus with different trajectories. All of them were knocked down by ‘Molecular Divider’.



Obsidian, cut in half, fell to the ground. The object defined as the object for ‘Dancing Blades’, was compromised, and the magic was forcibly interrupted due to the collapse of the definition.



But the attack of Arcturus did not end there. Using his magic, Arcturus moved after every attack he made, making it difficult for Canopus to find him.



When the wind blew, bird-like feathers danced around in the shape of an Eagle’s head.

These are feathered darts made from synthetic fibers and titanium needles. These ultrathin, high strength fiber don’t just cut the human skin, but also any protective skin depending on speed.



Dozens of feathers rode the wind and attacked Canopus. Arcturus specializes in Spirit Magic and Movement Type Magic. In particular, it is his ability to incorporate these magics to create and control an airflow. These feathers were not being controlled, but rather they just followed the air stream.



‘Molecular Divider’ can not interfere with gas. As each feather got blown away by the wind, they couldn’t be knocked away.



Canopus fought with magic that explodes a great amount of compressed air. He forces the wind away, which doubled as a protective shield, and he once again rushed Vega.



Regulus just looked behind him to see the back of Canopus.



Is it because his attack look aggressive that they cannot overcome the three to one stalemate?



Such an assumption emerged in Regulus' brain.



A large machine, which is used for training, danced in the air.



This was done by the Gravity Control Type Magic of Vega.



Canopus can do this as well since it belongs to the Weight Type Magic System. Even when the CAD system is in operation, he should be able to do it while staying on the same position. But his mind was currently focused on the large machine flying towards him.



So Regulus decided to take action.



Armed with an integrated CAD in the form of a rifle, he pulled the trigger.



From starting the Activation Sequence to the Magic Activation took around 2 seconds. Although this weapon uses a specialized type CAD, it was still quite fast.



Initially, Laser Sniping was a technique Regulus was good at, making him surpass the usual magic speed and power, combined with the enhanced performance of exclusive CAD systems. Under the influence of the parasite, this improved even further.



However, the time required to amplify the bullet used for the laser beam is mechanical, not physical so it cannot be shortened. This time can be reduced by starting with a higher level of Laser energy, which is possible if you improve the power to change an event by becoming a parasite.



But for this to happen, should Regulus have to change his already existing armed devices to allow for higher power consumption. Or should a completely new armed device be created?



Three days ago, Regulus became a parasite. In just three days he was unable upgrade the devices he prefers.



However, if Canopus is currently occupied with Vega, he shouldn’t be able to counterattack the attack even if it has a temporary delay. This is what Regulus was thinking.

But just before that, when he was about to launch a laser bullet.



Canopus disappeared from Regulus’ scope.



He hadn’t gone invisible.



Instead of the silhouette of a man, his view was being obstructed.



Something was reflected on the hangar, where Regulus himself was hiding.



The laser had been fired.



It’s impossible to deal with energy bullets coming at you at the speed of light if you are unprepared.



Having been perfectly reflected by hundred and eighty degrees, the energy bullets destroyed the armed device, and burning fragments came in to his right eye.



Screaming furiously, Regulus retired from the battle.



(Back to Canopus)



When he heard Regulus’ scream, Canopus knew what had happened.



He didn’t ignore Regulus. When he approached Vega to take her out, Regulus attacking him was inevitable. Canopus simply did not try to hide himself, which Regulus had expected.



But no doubt the battle will become easier with this. Regulus’ magic is nothing to be ignorant of, and now instead of a 1 versus 3, it became a 1 versus 2.



Immediately after that, he heard two noises in his eardrum.



Moving his eyes in the direction of where the sound came from. He retreated at the same time and went away from Vega. This was an act of security, which he had made unconsciously.



There he saw Algol and Deneb both fall.



In his heart, Canopus screamed out to Algol because he felt responsible. (Image 2)



Because Deneb was not the only one who staggered and collapsed. Algol also collapsed next to her. He looked the same as Deneb after their fight, but from a distance it became clear that he was trying not to excessively hurt her.



From Canopus’ position, it wasn’t possible to see Algol's back which was stained with blood.

No, if you look carefully, you could probably see, but in a situation where you have to be wary of the attacks of the enemy, you don’t have the luxury to check.



But he realized that a new enemy had attacked Algol.



This is because his opponent was aiming at himself.



The force field of a thin, sharp, deformed ‘Molecular Divider’ extended to Canopus.



He cut off the force field with the same magic.



(Lieutenant Spica!)



Before even seeing the enemy who released this magic, he already knew the identity of the operator.



A modified version of his ‘Molecular Divider’, ‘Molecular Divider - Javelin’ is only used by one person in STARS.



The First Lieutenant of the 4th Unit of the STARS, Zoe Spica.



Beyond Canopus’ line of sight, a woman, who wore the military uniform in the summer despite it being early in the morning, pointed at Canopus with her right hand.



A metal, non-curved nail was attached to the tip of her extended index finger. She kind of looked like a Japanese singer pointing at a crowd, but it was her stance when using ‘Molecular Divider - Javelin’.



Again, the narrow molecular destruction force field extended to Canopus. But instead of it being narrow and having a limited range, this ‘Molecular Divider’ could also be used at mid range, thus expanding its range.



Canopus once again cut off the head of the attack while also cutting Vega’s gravitational field, which he tried to do with his own version of ‘Molecular Divider’.



No, the expression ‘Molecular Divider’ cutting the ‘Gravity Control Magic’ could be misleading. Gravity Control is a magi’"Molecular Divider’ also changes the nature of space. Both magic collapsed due to a collision between Event Modifications that ‘change only the gravitational field in normal space’ and ‘change only the electromagnetic properties of normal space’.



At that moment, the ‘Molecular Divider’ of Canopus was also interrupted. Because Arcturus’ Tomahawk was approaching him.



Canopus jumped off to the side with full force and activated ‘Molecular Divider’.



Tomahawk destroyed the residual image of Canopus.



Tomahawk, turned over in the air and continued to go after Canopus, who was now standing on the ground once more.



Initially this was not possible for ‘Dancing Blades’. ‘Dancing Blades’ is a magic that allows you to pre-program the trajectory of an object in advance, but not the ability to remotely control the object.



By applying Spirit Magic, he could create a kind of interactive state with a weapon, making it able to give it his thoughts and rewrite the new ‘blades’ by doing this. This was the original skill of Arcturus, the magician holding magic of both ancient and modern times.



The increase in power usage that comes with rewriting magic definitions cannot be avoided. The trajectory can only be changed a maximum of five times. However, the trajectory itself does not have to be a straight line, or a parabola, because ‘Dancing Blades’ is able to move up and down, and turn around. With a normal weapon like a grenade, one would not be able to take out all their enemies, but if you could even change the trajectory of something just three times, not even the full five, then it would be far more potent.



Because of the parasite in Arcturus, he cannot use Spirit Magic. However, even though he has lost his ability to access independent Information bodies, which is defined as the ‘spirit’, this did not mean he lost his ability to use Ancient Magic. His Ancient Magic skills that do not use independent Information bodies have improved, because of his assimilation with the parasite.



Canopus intercepted the attacking Tomahawk with a sharp blow with his knee.



No matter the speed, the swing itself barely had any power. So it was more like swinging with a stick than with a sword.



However, Tomahawk, which was magically strengthened by Arcturus’ thought, fell apart.



The blade similar to a Japanese sword could not cut everything easily. Canopus’ original device did not cut similarly to a normal steel blade. The blade is simply the guiding tool, the blade that actually cuts is made out of magic. If the force that divides the intermolecular binding can be formed, then the vague shape of the blade doesn’t matter.



Tomahawk, that was divided into two parts, ceased to fly above the ground.



Even if it is being controlled through thought, if it loses its form, it will return to being a regular armed device, making the magic fail.



His pursuit of Arcturus was interrupted. Since ‘Dancing Blades’ requires material objects as a carrier, there is a limit to the number of ‘bullets’ that can be prepared in advance. Arcturus called forth such ‘bullets’.



Canopus could not find out the place where Arcturus was hiding. However, Arcturus’ temporary attack had disappeared - this was a prime opportunity to reduce the enemy’s combat power.



Now the enemies that Canopus focused on were Vega and Spica.



Spika’s ‘Molecular Divider - Javelin’ had the same characteristics as that of Canopus’. But it is only natural that it only has limited impact when the enemy knows its workings.



Canopus decided to focus on Vega, who was the more problematic enemy in the first place.



Canopus released a plasma bullet of air as a pretext so Spika would have to deal with that, but he also hit Vega with ‘Molecular Divider’.



Vega, even when wary of ‘Molecular Divider’, was completely defeated, and then she got hit by the plasma bullets. Canopus did not increase the plasma density too much as to avoid fatal injuries, but it was still powerful enough to temporarily paralyze her entire body.



Vega fell on her back. She did not seem to have completely fainted, but it seemed that she was unable to move her limbs freely.



Canopus looks back at Spica. He was going to finish off Spica and finally take Arcturus on in a one on one.



But what Canopus saw, was not just the silhouette of Spica, but also other people.



"Major Canopus, I want you to stop your resistance."



A new figure came into his sight.



Second Lieutenants Ian Bellatrix and Samuel Alnilam.



Two members of the 6th Unit in STARS, who got infected by parasites in the Micro-Black Hole experiment that was held the other day, were seen dragging the wounded and unconscious Algol who was in bad shape.



Spica was surprised. For her, this reinforcement was surprising.



"... ... Are you referring to a hostage?"



Canopus spoke to Arcturus in a tone that did not hide his disgusted feelings.



“We had captured Shaula beforehand.”



Arcturus did not answer his question, but instead extended his other hand.



“Major Canopus, your goal is to allow Major Sirius to escape, your goal has been accomplished, do you still think this battle that only increases the amount of injuries is smart?”



"It was you who caused senseless turbulence."



Canopus answered by condemning the silent Arcturus.



But reasoning doesn’t apply to people taken over by parasites, and Canopus knew this.



Canopus took out his Japanese looking armed device in the form of a sword.



"...Stand down."



"We guarantee your safety."



"Only for my body?"



To the sarcastic question of Canopus, Arcturus replied with a funny look.



“I do not plan to make you part of our group.”



◇ ◇ ◇



Contrary to the expectations of Canopus, he was not taken to a prison cell, but to a separate room, which the senior officer of another department used when they visited the base.



Of course, his weapons, including his armed devices, were taken, but escaping does not seem to be difficult. CAD is a must-have tool for modern magic users, but it is not necessary when conjuring magic. Although there are ways to make magic more difficult to use, a general method of making magic unusable has not been developed. Although he had heard stories about the possibility of preventing Magical Invocation of others by using a special magic related to Mental Interference Magic.



However, Canopus did not leave the room, so as not to escape. No food was brought to me for several hours, so he spent the night alone with just mineral water, which was in an equipped refrigerator.



When the messenger came to get him, it was already at 21:00.



He appeared between Lieutenant Bellatrix and Lieutenant Alnilam and appeared in the office of the Colonel.



There is a chair in front of the Colonel’s table.



Surrounding Canopus were on one side, Arcturus and Vega and on the other was Major Capella from the 5th Unit, who sat there with a muzzle aimed at his face.



"Major Canopus, wait.”



Following the words of the Colonel of the base, Walker, Canopus sat down in front of the table after saluting.



“Well, Major Canopus, it seems like your alleged injuries were worth it since you managed to help Ralph Hardy Mirfak get out of the base.”



Canopus' face contained a surprised expression.



Walker expected such a reaction.



"Surrounding Major Sirius’ departure, this was done through formal military facilities and directed by Colonel Balance, so it isn’t your fault."



In other words, it was not possible to ask Lina to return.



The surprised expression disappeared from Canopus' face and he regained his poker face.



“I think you know that the higher ups have agreed to take out the Japanese Strategic Class Magician, Shiba Tatsuya.”



"I am aware of this."



Dothey want to eliminate Tatsuya as a threat us, or include him in the USNA’s global strategy, taking the risk that he could be threat? The higher ups of the USNA army could all agree that these were the main two options.



“But you can understand that his Strategic Class Magic is too strong and should not be used”



"............"



To Walker's speech, Canopus responded with silence.



Walker lightly touched his eyebrows, but immediately returned to the original administrative view and resumed with the conversation.



“I think we should eliminate Tatsuya, Captain Arcturus and Captain Vega also agree”



“Colonel, their states of health should cause serious concern.”



But Canopus was unable to spark any form of suspicion in Walker.



"Major Canopus, it is true that they have become parasites, but their loyalty to this country has not changed. That is my core belief."



When he was looked at, Arcturus clearly turned his face.



“As for the treatment of Captain Arcturus, it is currently under review.”



Walker did not listen to the warning of Canopus.



At this point, Canopus was convinced that Walker was mentally being controlled by a parasite. Instead of it being a complete psychological take over, which would turn their partner into a puppet, a part of his thinking was definitely being influenced. By influencing the mind and stimulating the desire and crisis that he felt, Walker could be controlled as to their liking. ── Canopus suggested so.



“Major, it seems that you cannot approve the killing of Tatsuya.”



"Even if him becoming an enemy is inevitable, we should not take cowardly measures such as assassination."



“... ...But do you think such a naive thought should actually be followed upon?”



“I don't think it makes sense to deny naive thoughts.”



Canopus did not disagree with using dirty tactics. There are things that cannot be solved by just talking. Canopus knows about this to a certain extent from his own experience, so he doesn't need to say this.



But pride is necessary. If you indulge yourself with the unlimited use of the excuse ‘because it is necessary’, the army will quickly turn into a group that simply focuses on violence. These were Canopus’ thoughts.



"...Major Canopus. Do you want to take a plea deal?"



Walker didn’t bother trying to convince Canopus and changed the subject.



"Is this about the court cases?"



"That's right."



The interrogation of the higher ups found that he did not participate in any illegal bidding.



Afterwards, after Walker confirmed this, the tension that Canopus felt started to drop.



Walker continued on about the plea deal by expanding its range.



“If this becomes a military-legislative conference, headquarters will have to come as well. This is inevitable if we consider the special nature of our division. If a military council were to convene in current times, it will surely lead to quarreling between the opposing parties, hindering the impact any military operation can have.”



Canopus wanted to disagree with Walker's assumptions.



Of course, it can come to this. Nevertheless, the likelihood that this situation will lead to the council becoming dysfunctional is low. The higher ups are not so stupid.



Usually Canopus would have told him this. But when he took his current position into account, he couldn’t afford to give a negative opinion.



“If you recognize the injuries you gave to Lieutenant Regulus, we will consider Lieutenant Mirfak to have went missing because of the mission he is taking, and we will also promise to reduce the punishment for Lieutenant Algol and Shaula.”



"What punishment will I specifically get?"



Canopus already started defending himself.



“A one-year prison sentence.”



This is a pretty harsh punishment for justice. However, given that the parasite is disturbing Walker, Canopus believed that imprisonment, which can physically distance him from them, would be convenient for them.



"In addition, we will treat the punishment as a penalty during an undercover mission, so it will not scratch your military history and won’t harm your family."



"...Well, I have two conditions."



“Fine. Let's make it an even trade. ”



Walker's voice was unexpectedly soft. Was his subconscious mind resisting the thought manipulation or was he trying to avoid breaking the deal because of Canopus’ combat value?



Both were probable theories.



“I want to be imprisoned in Midway Prison.”



"... Why?"



Walker had a perplexed expression. The military prisons on Midway Island are the most unpopular, and are completely isolated from society - a place where criminals with highest offenses are sent to.



"Isn't that more comfortable for the Colonel?"



Canopus felt this was ironic because it allows him to not worry about being disturbed.



Walker momentarily made an angry face, but that offensive expression disappeared almost immediately.



“Well, let me decide after hearing what your other condition is?”



“Lieutenant Algol and Shaula, I would like it for them to come with me.”



"Won’t they both be offended by going to Midway prison?"



"Will they be punished there?"



Canopus did not move because of the disgust he felt with Walker.



"─ ─ I accept your terms and will meet you halfway with Capelle being your guard till you get there.”



Erase that expression on your face, that’s what Walker was trying to tell him.



After this conversation, Captain Arcturus and Captain Vega smiled.



Major Capella, who was sitting across from them, was always capricious.



The imprisonment of Canopus, Algol and Shaula was officially accepted on the next day to happen as soon as possible.



Many people felt suspicious about this abnormally fast decision that was made by the Pentagon.



But there were none who tried to prevent this decision, including Colonel Balance.



[Two]



Sunday morning, June 23rd, 2097.



Angie Sirius, the High Captain of ‘STARS’ whose real name is Angelina Kudou Shields was currently on board of a small VTOL plane.



Angelina, commonly known as Lina, fled from the base of their headquarters because of the members that had assimilated with parasites and she was therefore branded a rebel.



She fled to Japan under the direction of Colonel Balance and with the help of the Kuroba family, who she stayed with for a couple of days, but last night she spent it in Tatsuya’s and Miyuki’s apartment.



But now she was moving to a new place where she could hide. Miyaki Island was located around 90 kilometers to the north of the South Sea, and about 50 kilometers to the east of Miyake-jima. This small island is also called the ‘Newest Island of the 21st Century’ because it was formed because of the activities of an underwater volcano in the first year of the 21st century. Despite it being small, the area has grown to be about 8 square kilometers, which is almost the same size as Tokyo.



This island has become a new shelter for Lina.



Miyaki Island is the private property of the Yotsuba Family, but to be precise, it is owned by a real estate company controlled by the Yotsuba. Regardless of the technicalities, it still has the same result.



There is a special story behind the acquiry of the island by the Yotsuba family.



Originally, this was a supply base for the Japanese Navy. But due to volcanic activity, it was abandoned in the 2050’s . After the end of WWII, it became a secret prison exclusively for military magicians and was entrusted to the Yotsuba Family as they were the only ones capable of managing magicians of such military caliber.



The Yotsuba acquired Miyaki island, while also taking over the secret prison.



However, the prison was relocated to a different side of the island because of volcanic activity on the eastern side of the island. The place of transfer was decided on some time ago, and finally, as of last month, the transfer of prisoners was completed and the facilities were refurbished.



Also on the eastern side of the island, which was not used as a prison anymore, a plan was made for constructing buildings that were going to be used for magical research. Although the construction was supposed to start in April, the power plant that uses the Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor that was designed by Tatsuya will also be built in the area.

Another small VTOL came that carried Tatsuya and Miyuki. Despite the main reason for visiting being that he wanted to check up on Lina, Tatsuya also wanted to inspect the place where the plant was going to be built.



At the end of last month, he had decided to implement his ESCAPES plan here. Tatsuya visited Miyaki island several times to understand both the topography and the climate to check if he had chosen the right spot. He was sure that it was necessary to check whether or not there were any environmental conditions that he was unaware of.



“Thank you, Miyuki-san, Shields-san, we will be landing soon.”



Hyougo, who was controlling the compact VTOL, informed them. In this VTOL there currently were six people, with the exception of the pilot, and there is no partition between the pilot and passengers. The voice of Hyougo came right to Tatsuya.



“It's pretty broad, it also has an unusual infrastructure which is quite unexpected.”



Lina, who saw the island for the first time, gave her impression of what she saw.



"Well ... this has changed a lot."



Miyuki had been here in the past, so she could not hide her surprise of the scenes before her.



"You have been on this island?"



"Well, four years ago."



When she visited four years ago, there only were prisons in the coastal zone in the west, and most of the island was rocky and sandy.



However, the now more developed Miyaki island has airfields with short runways in the northern part of the island, geothermal power stations in the center and more than 10 middle-class buildings in the eastern part.



Tatsuya was also struck by surprise, but for different reasons that Miyuki..



(... is that a stone refinement plant?)



(There also is an advanced computerised building in the center...)



Tatsuya found a building with the characteristics similar to the FLT laboratory in Tokyo.



And suddenly he was convinced.



A new Yotsuba home will be built on this island.



Maya didn’t tell Tatsuya the full plan.



Only that the new plant for his ESCAPES project will be built on Miyaki island.



So, the part of the plan that included building the second home of the Yotsuba here was unknown to him.



It seems that the Yotsuba house is trying to build a private research laboratory here next to the upcoming open experimental facility. And, perhaps, among the researchers gathered here for the ESCAPES project, they are thinking of including particularly prominent people from the Yotsuba house, to achieve even further development of magical technology.



A small VTOL landed on the helipad. The runway here is not long enough for large aircrafts to land and take off, but if it’s a VTOL or a compact aircraft with less than 50 passengers, it can take off and land sufficiently. The Yotsuba were serious about the development of this island.



As expected, there were no trains or monorails. The four were driving a self-propelled vehicle prepared by the Mashiba, one of the branch families of the Yotsuba clan that runs the prison, which was on the west side of the island.



They walked around the volcano, where there was little activity going on, and arrived at the residential district for prison management. On the way there, as before, they saw cliffs of lava, and the coast, filled with stones. The development of the island seemed to have a strong focus on the east side of the island.



About half of the prisoners were left here, and a large part of the management staff has also left this part of the island. This was bound to happen when most of the guards moved on to the new prison.



Personnel management facilities remained full. The residential buildings were also ready to be occupied.



"Ho.... This is more like an apartment, not a hotel."



They got the impression that Lina was looking through the room with satisfaction. So Tatsuya and Miyuki had no objections to her first impression.



"Food can also be purchased in the refrigerators and warehouses, you also don’t have to worry about clothing for the foreseeable future."



"...OK."



Lina looked suspicious because she was worried that Tatsuya only picked things men enjoy to see. However, Mirfak, who is her subordinate and also a man, would not have done such things, so her worries may be unnecessary.



“This facility area doesn’t only have places for residency but also convenience stores, training rooms, rest rooms, etc. do you wish to look at them?”



She assumed that this was just a warehouse that at times could be used by the prison staff.



Tatsuya asked Lina for what she wanted to do with his eyes. Today's visit is to ask the manager if they can use the prison on Miyaki island as a shelter for Lina. Lina thought that she had no choice in the matter, but that was her misunderstanding. If Lina had said, ‘I don’t like it’, the Yotsuba house would have prepared a different shelter.



"... Can you show me around?"



Even here, Lina misunderstood that she had no right to refuse. She was going to hold off on the inevitable tour but she ended up agreeing to it anyways.



"Hey... Tatsuya, are you sure I can live here?"



This was the first thing Lina said after they had returned to her room



"That would certainly be the best."



Although she felt that it was strange to respond, Lina still told the other side in order keep the conversation going:



"It would be nice to say that I dislike it ..."



Lina's voice sounded tired. This was probably mental fatigue, not physical fatigue, probably from all the surprises she has gotten this day.



She never felt so luxurious as she feels now with all of the services available to her.



Because she could get anything she wanted.



There is nothing she could think of that could cause any inconvenience she may have in the future.



Same for this room. Apart from the fact that she can't leave the area, she finds it more comfortable than her place at the STARS headquarters. This was not what Lina imagined after her life threatening situation.



"Besides, I guess I’m glad that you showed me something like that...?"



Lina's eyes had been moving around uncontrollably.



The places she visited with her host as a guest wasn’t just the prison facility. She also got to see the laboratory that was under construction.



Bypassing the personnel manager, Tatsuya, Miyuki and Lina headed to the eastern part of the island, where they were going to use a helicopter. Not only when they wanted to tour the facilities, but whenever it came to transportation for Tatsuya, Hyougo took the initiative to take care of it himself. In the two months that Hyougo served Tatsuya, it seems he has found something that is worth dedicating his loyalty to Tatsuya to.



The place where they went to was a factory for processing induction stones, which was the only thing Lina could focus her eyes on when they flew by.



The induction stone is the heart of the CAD system. Its main method of manufacturing it is widely known. Technology related to CADs, developed as a military technology, was not protected by a patent but was not completely open to the public. However, technological leaks have become more common, because of spying between developers, which no longer made them confidential.



However, this is only the technology used for the basic induction stones and although these induction stones can be manufactured using these published methods, it was still difficult to produce high level induction stones.



The induction stone is the component meant to connect the psion and electrical signals. However, not all induction stones convert these signals the same and they have to be adjusted depending on the design, and the efficiency will also change during its final check.



An induction stone may differ in its efficiency to convert signal, so an induction stone, that was produced in different way, may have a higher rate of converting signals. Some stones are able to convert weaker signals, while others may have the ability to accurately reproduce a signal.



For example, Rosen MagiCraft from Germany, McGregor Wand from the UK, America's Maximilian Device were companies that were highly appreciated for their general level of their induction stones, in that order, but in terms of their ability to accurately reproduce the signal, the Japanese FLT is considered the leading global company. ── And the characteristics of all induction stones made directly by the military and national research institutions were not known in detail.



The design of an induction stone is a serious intellectual asset of every company and country. It was unheard of to show the production factory of induction stones to outsiders because this was considered to be the common sense for the magic industry. Lina's words about ‘such things’ reflected this ‘common sense’.



“If you understand this, wouldn't you be indifferent about getting closer to it?”



"... I don’t want to be separated, and I want to see everything from the beginning to the end."



Lina tried complaining about it. However, her tone lacked the strength.



She did not know how long she needed to hide on this island.



If the delays in her current conversation would last for too long, all tension would disappear.



And if she wasn’t correctly paying attention, any information might go past her and could cause unnecessary problems in the future.



Lina could not completely deny that she was given many resources.



"That's right."



He easily accepted what Lina said and looked back in the direction of the facilities.



The facility manager gave us a glance and gave us an envelope, which Tatsuya took with his hands.



"Lina, this is the key to your room"



"Oh, thanks ..."



Lina opened the envelope and looked at what was inside.



A gold key card could be seen.



“With this card you can freely use all the amenities on the island, including food and shopping, reissuing one would be possible even if it got lost, but that would be a little troublesome.”



"I understand, I will be careful."



Lina took the card with both hands.



“If you need anything, call me with the fixed terminal in your room, you can use it to contact me, Miyuki, Ayako or the Yotsuba Family.”



"Ok."



"What else do you want to do?"



“I don’t know, but I'll call you if I need something.”



"Please do that."



Tatsuya returned to Miyuki.



Miyuki, who was standing behind Tatsuya at an angle, stepped forward.



"Well, Lina, soon... I'll be back to see you again."



"Yes, that’s right, thank you very much."



Lina shook her hand at her, while also looking a little shy.



Miyuki smiled and turned around for a bit.





◇ ◇ ◇



"Tatsuya-san, there is something that I would like you to see."



Tatsuya, who was planning on heading to the parking lot, was followed by Hyougo who followed him.



Today he didn’t have any other plans besides taking a tour around the island. So Tatsuya answered: “That’s fine.” and he instructed Hyougo to take him to the warehouse.



The place where Hyougo brought Tatsuya along with Miyuki to was a garage next to the runway.



There was only one peculiar four-wheeled car that was painted blue.



"This is an unusual design, not that of your average car ..."



As Tatsuya said, the center of the car’s body was part of the engine, because the engine wouldn’t fit otherwise. In the case of a hydrogen engine or an ethanol engine, it could have been designed to be in the middle of the car, but in the case of an electric vehicle, it was important to place it either at the front or back wheels, but still, this was definitely a self-propelling car with electrical driving features.



“This car is an ‘Air Car’.”



"... Do you mean that this machine has incorporated Flying Type magic in it?"



He had no base for his suspicions, but when he focused his eyes on Hyougo, it seems like he was correct.



“The development itself was something that was launched two years ago along with your flying motorcycle Wingless, but it was finally completed."





Indeed, Tatsuya had developed a new Magic Sequence for flying magic that could be used for heavy objects back in April. Nevertheless, he had been busy with various things, such as

Miyuki’s succession as the next Head of the family, which he had already put in a corner of his consciousness.



“Since this vehicle has already been registered as a self-propelled vehicle for use on public roads, it can be used in daily life.”



"Can it also be used for getting to this island?"



"Of course, I will come to get you as soon as you call."



He answered with a subtle expression, but Tatsuya didn’t think that this was going to be a problem from the very beginning.



"Onii-sama, do you want to try it out?"



Miyuki recommended that he’d make a test drive.



"No, let's stop for today."



Tatsuya shook his head, with a bit of hesitation. However, he was not interested in the ‘air car’ at the moment.



"I will check it out tomorrow."



"Of course, then I shall explain the workings of the machine when the time comes."



Tatsuya hated that Miyuki would be left unattended for during the trial run. Tatsuya decided that testing the Air Car would come when Miyuki was away.



◇ ◇ ◇



When Tatsuya and the others were visiting Miyaki Island.



Despite it being a Sunday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense suffered from a turbulence.



There was a confidential demand made by the USNA to Japan via a diplomatic route.



It was a request for cooperation to search for Major Angie Sirius, who fled to Japan. It was decided that if she were to be found, she would be protected by and transferred to the embassy.

The Japanese government protested against the USNA for having such a high-ranking officer enter without prior notice. Though it was argued that her visit wasn’t for military purposes, and even if it was a lie, it was clear that no one could be blamed anymore.



The Japanese government promised the USNA to search and protect Angie Sirius.



“Although the demands of the United States are bold, they also seem to be good at the same time, but will the 101st Brigade be required to get involved?”



“Lieutenant Colonel Kazama, I'm too tired for this, can you just stop playing ignorant?”



"Sorry."



Despite his response, he still had an amused face.



However, simply by moving his facial muscles, ironic feelings were flowing from his pupils.



As the person in question whose face suffered from mental fatigue ─In other words, Saeki glared at Kazuma with a look of exhaustion.



However, no further apology came from Kazama.



Saeki was the one who took the initiative.



"I know that Major Sirius is being protected by the Yotsuba family."



"Have you heard that from them?"



“It was more of a warning than a message.”



"Angie Sirius is under their protection, the Defense Forces aren’t allowed to get involved… is what you are trying to say...?"



"It looks like that’s the case."



Seaki nodded with a bitter expression. This time, Kazama was in sync with her.



"Do you think Special Officer Ooguro is involved?"



"Yes, Lieutenant Colonel, I think so."



Tatsuya, as ‘Special Officer Ooguro’, and Lina as ‘Angie Sirius’, when regarding the exchanges that occurred between them, both Seaki and Kazama knew about what took place in the winter of last year.



The USNA’s nationally recognized Strategic-Class Magician ‘Angie Sirius’. The only reasons why the Yotsuba Family would want to protect her was because of Tatsuya’s involvement. That was Kazama’s reasoning. ── Though his reasoning isn’t wrong, it is unlikely that Kazama, who doesn’t know about the connection between the Yotsuba Family and Colonel Balance, would think so.



"Special Officer Ooguro… no, are you going to request for Tatsuya to hand Major Sirius over?"



“Ultimately, she will be handed over to the USNA.”



Despite Saeki giving a formal answer, it didn’t answer Kazama’s question. However, Kazama was fully aware of Saeki’s true intentions with this response.



In other words, it will take some time before she will be handed over.



The plan is to use Lina as a bargaining chip.



Sirius is a nationally recognized Strategic Class Magician. One of the trump cards belonging to the USNA.



The US military’s trump card can’t just be Sirius alone, but when it ends up in the hands of the enemy, it can become quite the threatening situation.



Getting it back ─ or disposing of it ─ if so, there is a possibility of drawing out a small concession.



"... Why did Sirius end up abandoning the USNA?"



Strategic-Class Magicians are individuals who may become a threat to the state. They need to be carefully managed to such an extent that such things won’t happen.



Kazama’s question was reasonable.



“Unfortunately, detailed information is not available.”



The National Defense Forces have also released spies to the United States. Despite the fact that they are in an alliance with one another, this wouldn’t mean that they wouldn’t engage in intelligence gathering activities. People who think that an alliance is something eternal and absolute are not suitable for military or political affairs.



However, that same awareness can be applied to both sides. Just as Japan is wary of American spies, even more so, America is also wary of Japan’s spying activities. Information related to the escape of a nationally recognized Strategic-Class Magician isn’t supposed to be easy to obtain.



“Is it dangerous to go out without knowing the circumstances?”



“It is, that’s why I want you to ask him yourself.”



Get Sirius and ask questions later, that’s what she was thinking .



Kazama learned of a vague danger associated with the idea given by his superior officer, but wasn’t able to explain his reasoning.



"I’ll ask Tatsuya if I’m able to meet Sirius."



"Why do you need to ask?"



He wasn’t able to understand what she wanted to say and wondered.



She conveyed the order, ignoring Kazama’s confusion.



"Lieutenant Colonel Kazama, order Special Officer Ooguro to hand over Major Angie Sirius."



"What should we do if Tatsuya refuses?"



"We should try to avoid any tough measures. However, the will of the National Defense Forces is that Sirius cannot be kept inside the country. Please tell him that so there’s no room for misunderstanding."



In other words, even if the government or foreign forces try to take Sirius, the 101st Brigade won’t lend its power to Tatsuya.



"I understand."



He had never expected Tatsuya to rely on them.



Also, he understood in theory that genuine soldiers aren’t candidates the same as foreign officials are whom the government would admit asylum for.



But at the same time, Kazama did not think that this was the correct answer.



◇ ◇ ◇



It was late in the afternoon, but Tatsuya and Miyuki, who had just returned from Miyaki Island and got home, immediately went to see Minami.



Along the way, they passed through quite a few magicians from the Juumonji Family, but Tatsuya pretended not to notice. It also seemed like it was their main priority to capture Minoru, and not to protect Minami.



“I want you to keep a close eye on the hospital ward.”



Miyuki, on the other hand, voiced her displeasure in the lack of protection around Minami’s room.



When Tatsuya knocked on the door of the room, any dissatisfaction Miyuki had, disappeared.



"Could we enter Minami?"



“Yes” “Don’t” “Is Miyuki-senpai with you?”



Confusion was all over Miyuki and Tatsuya’s faces..



All they heard were answers from three different people.



They opened the door after hearing Minami’s consent.



Looking near the bed, it was easy to see who were in the room.



The first was Kasumi, who was near the bed and was donning a disgruntled face, probably because she saw Tatsuya.



Izumi expressed her joy with a full smile, probably because she saw Miyuki.



They were the Saegusa Twins, who were their underclassmen in high school.



"Izumi-chan, did you come to visit Minami-chan as well?"



“Yes, when my classmates are hospitalized, I just can’t stop thinking about them being away.”



The role of the Saegusa Family was decided upon during the meeting between the families. It was decided that they were the ones to intercept and capture Minoru. What became clear is that protecting Minami was not a part of this.



"Thank you for being so considerate."



So Miyuki responded with a beautiful smile.



It wasn’t really necessary, but they came for Minami. Anyways, these two came to see Minami as a classmate, not because of the missions assigned to the Saegusa Family. Because of this, Miyuki actually felt grateful for them being here.



"Wow! You are too kind..."



Izumi let out a shy, but impressed voice. It could be said that this was more about her being happy, than sad. It was a bit overdramatic, but the feelings behind it were true.



Neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki gave her a disappointed look. Minami was sitting on her bed, pleasantly surprised by her words. And only Kasumi, the twin sister, looked at her with a cold gaze.



Tatsuya walked towards Minami and sat next to her.



Behind Tatsuya was Miyuki, and behind her was Izumi.



As a result, they had switched places with Kasumi and Izumi.



"So Minami, how are you?"



He stood next to her bed. There was a chair placed next to her bad, but it had a pillow in it with her leg resting on that pillow, so neither he nor Miyuki sat down.



"Yes, I think I’m gradually getting better."



It wasn’t clear if her sense of touch had fully returned, but could he be sure of this when he hadn’t done a complete check up?



It is clear that she has recovered some of her strength, since she no longer requires the help of the auxiliary exoskeleton— an auxiliary, wearable type of power device that was designed for medical use. However, her sense of touch can’t be measured by only looking from the outside.



"That’s good..."



When she heard that Minami’s symptoms had improved, Miyuki could finally remove the hand that was clutched to her chest and she exhaled.



"Is this true?"



Tatsuya also relaxed his mouth a little.



“Maybe it won’t become worse, but please stay a bit more patient and wait till you’re fully recovered.”



"Yes."



Although he didn’t know if Minami was actually going to listen to his advise, but at least from the surface it looked like she wasn’t lying.



"What has the doctor said?"



“That I can leave the hospital in about two weeks.”



To Miyuki’s question, Minami responded with a calm tone.



"Does this include rehabilitation?"



"I have not heard anything about this."



If she stays here two more weeks, she’ll have been hospitalized for about a month. Tatsuya wondered if he should bring PIxie back home in order to help Minami.



"Is that so? But if rehabilitation is necessary, then we can help you at home, can we not?”



There is no need to help her, but he added this quickly afterwards so Miyuki wouldn’t be bothered.



“We will help you with everything”



"That’s too much!"



This time Minami was in a bit of a panic.



Maybe because of the situation, but when he heard that Minami’s reaction was the same as before, Tatsuya realized that she had somewhat recovered.



“I don’t want to bother you, so..."



"So..."



Miyuki and Minami didn’t really know what to say.



So an unexpected offer came from Izumi.



“Miyuki-senpai, if you don't mind, I would like to help with her rehabilitation after her discharge.”



"Izumi-chan?"



"Sure, if you don’t mind."



When you consider it, Izumi’s intentions weren’t evil, probably. In the end Tatsuya didn’t mention it.



Izumi saw Minami as a classmate and she wouldn’t use that as a chance to get inside Miyuki’s house.



"Izumi...you’re not trying to use this as a chance to get inside of the President’s house... are you?"



However, Kasumi didn’t refrain from asking the question.



“That is out of the question! How could you think of such nonsense!"



Afterwards, Izumi’s voice and face both looked upset.



Izumi opened her eyes and looked at Kasumi.



Izumi didn’t look completely defeated, but she was definitely averting her eyes from Kasumi.



“....President, when Izumi is coming to your house, I shall accompany her.”



Miyuki replied with ‘Thank you both’ and an ambiguous smile to Kasumi's words.



The two of them left the chamber, probably to get Izumi away from Miyuki.



The three people watch as the twin sisters leave and they all had a similar smile on their face while doing so.



Although they were a bit much, you can’t hate them for it. That was the kind of smile they had.



Minami's classmates are some nice girls. However, to her, Izumi can be perceived as someone that can be loved, but she can also be a bit over the top.



Tatsuya took a chair from the corner of the room and sat down.



Miyuki sat on a stool that was originally next to the bed.



"Still, I am grateful that they came to visit you..."



Miyuki wasn’t the only one who thought this.



Tatsuya completely agreed with it.



To the Saegusa, Minami was just being used as a bait.



This should not be condemned. This was a decision made during the meeting between the Ten Master Clans, and if you think about, the Saegusa Family shouldn’t have even been involved in the matter.



Koichi was thinking about his own position among the Clans, so he decided to help out. However, the Saegusa will help Minami. So this was the right thing to do in their position.



"The two of them aren’t suited for it."



Tatsuya didn’t explain what he meant with the word ‘it’, but neither Miyuki nor Minami failed to understand what he meant.



Neither Kasumi nor Izumi are suitable for the Ten Master Clans. Their sister Mayumi is a little more suited for being in it, but that’s because she gives more priority to her position and responsibilities. However, Kasumi and Izumi aren’t as focused on status, rather they focus more on kindness.



In short, it isn’t necessarily ‘bad’.



"I don’t think it‘s bad, I envy them a little."



The word that Miyuki had let out was evidence that she felt the same as Tatsuya, who was thinking the same way.



"By the way, Minami"



He suddenly changed the subject.



"Yes, what is it?"



Although he suddenly said her name, Minami wasn’t surprised at all.



"Have there been any abnormalities up until now?"



"Are you asking if Minoru has made contact with me since then?"



"That is part of it."



"I have not seen any suspicious visitors appear."



As soon as Minami added: “I also haven’t seen him in my mind” Tatsuya said,



“I don’t think Minoru has given up, maybe he is preparing something? For example, he could be collecting teammates."



Miyuki looked a bit hectic when she looked at Tatsuya’s face



"The possibility exists."



It’s been a week since the last raid. In the meantime, he has not touched the bait that had been set out.



Although he hasn’t been able to confirm it, it seems like Minoru has inherited the knowledge of Zhou Gongjin.



Every family that holds the number ‘Nine, including the Kudou family, rarely discusses things with other families, making it difficult to gather allies. However, it would be possible to do this by using the underground networked that had been created by Zhou.



“Maybe I should ask our aunt about a way to seal parasites.”



Miyuki and Minami both weren’t completely sure what Tatsuya was thinking.



When Tatsuya mentioned a technique to seal parasites, Minami wasn’t completely sure what he meant.



But Miyuki had a suspicion.



"Onii-sama... do you think Minoru-kun is going to increase the number of parasites he has? Like what was done in the incident during last winter?"



"I do not think that Minoru would attack people at random, but I think he will try to acquire more power to overcome his current obstacles, be it through other people or through something not human.”



Miyuki couldn’t deny Tatsuya’s guesses. And not just Miyuki, Minami also couldn’t deny it. Of course there was a voice in the back of their head telling them he’s wrong, but this wasn’t because of Tatsuya being wrong, but rather their own human weakness.



“Onii-sama, I have been thinking about this but ... Shouldn't you also warn Erika and the others about this?”



"... Yes, that would be smart."



Tatsuya wore a difficult face.



Erika, Leo and Mikihiko had met Minoru last fall. To them, he was not an enemy, but a friend. They wouldn’t be alarmed if he were to suddenly appear before their eyes..



Minoru can hide the presence of the parasite itself. Perhaps Mikihiko would be able to notice its presence, but Erika and Leo were more likely to be deceived.



In the end, they decide that these three people should be informed.



"Like them, I would have also been deceived... Should I tell them myself?"



“No, I’ll do it, but I’m going to be testing the Air-Car tomorrow, so please wait for me at Einebrise after school.”



"... Are you sure?"



It was as if Miyuki was asking her Master for permission, because he was busy with fighting the world.



“The risk of being overheard will definitely be lower than if we were to talk at school, it may be possible to ask the owner to lend us his help.”



"The owner ...?"



The real purpose behind Einebrise is to gather and sell information, and the owner himself is also involved in the acquiry of information, but Tatsuya did not know the specifics.



However, Tatsuya was convinced that the owner wouldn’t be stubborn. He could notice that the owner listens to the hierarchy of society, which Miyuki wasn’t all too familiar with.



"No, I understand."



Miyuki did not know what the owner was truly like. If this was necessary, then Tatsuya would have told her. It didn’t need to be explained to her, because she figured it wasn’t necessary for her to know.



“I will be waiting at Einebrise with Erika and the others… Oh Onii-sama, should I also tell Mizuki, Honoka and Shizuku to come?"



“I don’t want the number of people to know to increase too much, but… it would also be risky to leave them alone… fine, please invite them all to come.”



"Of course."



Miyuki had discussed everything Tatsuya, and then they looked at Minami.



"... What is it?"



Turning their eyes to her, Minami felt a bit anxious, because they were staring at her, without opening their mouth to speak.



"Although it may be a bit sudden..."



It was Miyuki who was going to ask Minami.



"What do you, Minami-chan, think of Minoru-kun?"



"What ...?"



It was like Minami’s face stopped working.



Her thoughts were temporarily paralyzed by the unexpected question.



"It seems that Minoru-kun seems to like Minami-chan."



"He likes ..."



Her thinking ability was currently impaired, so Minami could only mutter a few words.



"Minami doesn’t like him?"



"Do I like him?!"



Minami raised her outraged voice. It seems like her level of excitement got so high that she was starting to regain consciousness.



“I never thought about him in that way!”



"You just didn't think about it?"



In his own words, Tatsuya wondered about Minami’s response.



“So is it that you don’t care about him or that you haven’t thought about it?”



"We aren’t that curious about it."



"............"



She could not understand what Tatsuya and Miyuki were trying to say.



She did not understand any of this.



"We’re not demanding an answer, but if you like Minoru ... ...."



"You must decide what you wants to do."



"If so ... are you prepared to fight Minoru?"



Minami herself was confused, but at the same time, she wore a sad face.



"We have to fight."



Tatsuya’s reply also had a strong tone.



"I think I want to try defeat Minoru without killing him as much as possible, but I won’t be the only one looking for him."



Minami became quiet and small.



Minami didn’t know that she was being used as bait by the Clans and the Saegusa Family. However, she at least knew that she was involved in the mission to capture him.



She didn’t forget about Izumi who was talking about becoming her ‘escort’, but because she grew up in an unusual environment, she merely believed that her visit and her actions were just her acting as a classmate.



“In addition, Minoru is strong, the reality is that trying to catch him would be a naive dream.”



"So I have no say in the matter."



“In the head, the answer is obvious, but what about the answer in your heart?”



"............"



The question that Minami could not answer.



“This is what I’m trying to say: Minami, Minoru gave up being human to save you, but he did this without your consent, so you don’t need to comply.”



"............"



"However, it will not be so easy to capture him; you know Minoru."



".... Yes"



Minami was quiet and tried to hide her face, because she knew what they were trying to say.



"If you like him, that’s natural, you are human, so you don’t need to be ashamed of anything."



Miyuki held Minami’s hands.



"...... Yes"



Minami lifted her face and smiled faintly at Miyuki.



"But if you do not have special feelings for Minoru-kun, then I would like you to make that decision."



“Prepare to not be disturbed, when Minoru could be taken out in front of you.”



She ended her speech.



Tatsuya did not want Miyuki to say the word ‘kill’.



"If I told you that I... I like him… Then I would like you to capture him without killing him."



Tatsuya showed a little bit of sadness and crouched.



"In this case, the likelihood of casualties appearing, will increase."



Minami’s complexion changed.



"I apologize! I shouldn’t have said that!"



"Minami, calm down"



Miyuki, who was next to Minami on the bed, was trying to support her.



Minami sat there on the bed and tried to apologize. It seems like she has not recovered enough to make any sudden movements.



“I don’t think that was a stupid comment, even I don’t completely understand the feelings I currently have even though I was able to a long time ago.”



"That’s not true!"



Miyuki exclaimed this while looking at Tatsuya with strong will in her eyes.



"I don’t know if I have any special emotions for him."



It was clear that Minami hadn’t really thought about it, and what she said was merely what she had just thought of. But even if we were to point this out, Minami would have denied it.



"I understand."



So in the end, Minami was overwhelmed by the question and was unable to correctly answer Tatsuya.



[Three]



Monday, June 24th.



Like Tatsuya had planned in his schedule yesterday, today he was going to visit Miyaki Island again.



The main purpose of his visit was to test the ‘Air-Car’, but there wasn’t anything very special about the testing. This was because it worked as predicted. ── In addition, in this case, the ‘Air’ in Air-Car was misleading, technically it would be ‘flying’, but they used ‘air’ as to avoid any confusion in names, even though it doesn’t really use the air to fly.



"I did not expect that it could dive underwater."



“The engineers have said that the level of airtightness of the vehicle should not cause any problems, even if it were to go into outer space. Its flight height exceeds 6000 kilometers in terms of still being able to function, but because of the gravity of the Earth affecting the car’s body, it seems that it stops working. "



"I probably won’t go underwater unless it’s necessary."



To the excessive speculations, which Hyougo had given him, Tatsuya couldn’t help but smile.



"The two-door style also increases its airtightness because it reduces the amount of openings, right?"



The door of the car does not open like a regular door, but it has a design that allows you to slide the doors backwards. In addition, the window glass is thick and tinted. And its overall design also improves its airtightness.



“There is also another point to it, since normal airplanes can only be used on land, low altitudes and above sea, it can still come in handy in some situations.”



"Like I said, I don’t intend to go up into the stratosphere or dive into the sea in the Air-Car, unless I need to."



“Although I’m a bit more old-fashioned, it will still suffice as the main method between Japan and the Island, especially when using the walking on water mode.”



“Is this a mode that automatically elevates the vehicle tens of centimeters above the ground?”



"Yes, when considering this, a license for a small boat to navigate the ocean should be enough, so we won’t have to worry about the government taking action."



Tatsuya was 18 years old, and he had already acquired a license for small vessels without water restrictions, as well as a license for a 4-wheeled vehicle. It goes without saying that the license to operate the vessel should not be an aerial vehicle, but if its water mode is being used, it should basically act like a boat or hovercraft, which could be argued that it can be used by Tatsuya.



"Understood."



If anything happens, he could just fly away. Tatsuya, lacking in legal reasoning, was thinking in such a way.



"Hey."



A voice came from the side, and when he turned around, he saw Lina standing a couple of meters away.



"Lina, what's wrong?"



The master of the voice was Lina, who was forced to observe the testing of the car.



"Can I really go after this?"



"I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say...."



"What you have just shown me is a secret military-type vehicle."



"Lina, what are you talking about?"



Tatsuya looked back at Lina with a strange look.



“Since the Yotsuba is a private organisation, the Air-Car does not fall under ‘Military secrets’.”



“What are you saying! Even if it isn’t an army, that won’t change the fact that it is a military organization! ”



“That is a misunderstanding - we are not a military organization, we could resort to violence if compensation was given, but that is only our secondary job, the Yotsuba family primarily is a research organization.”



"What kind of a joke is that? For someone to be feared around the world for their side job!?"



“They don’t have to be afraid of the possibility of this happening to them.”



"You have the power to destroy a fleet, a base and a port all with one attack!"



"This is my personal strength, not that of the Yotsuba family."



Lina, with wide opened eyes, stared at Tatsuya and didn’t know what to think.



Lina couldn’t believe what Tatsuya had just said, when he declared the power to kill tens of thousands as his own. He is essentially taking full responsibility for killing that many people without trying to share the burden.



The responsibility can be divided. ‘Scorched Halloween’ is an incident that occurred during a military conflict. The use of Strategic Class Magic was decided by the military, and the responsibility could be said to lie with the boss.



However, even if that were the case, he still says that that power belongs to him, so the result would only be attributed to him.



No matter who is responsible, the result still remains the same.



Tens of thousands of people died.



(Or maybe Tatsuya doesn't think about this....?)



(No, such a thing is impossible.)



Tatsuya is not one of those people who ignore reality. They hadn’t known each other for long, but Lina did understand Tatsuya to a certain degree. Tatsuya accepting the fact that he is a mass murderer, that would be insane…..



"...It isn’t a military secret and I can leave you whenever I want, is that so..."



Lina decided to drop the topic. She is also a Strategic Class Magician, so if she continued digging they could come to a topic that she’d rather not talk about.



"Anyways, Tatsuya, I have a favor."



"If I can grant you it depends on the favor itself, so let’s discuss it first."



They currently were in a warehouse, or since the Air-Car, which is registered as a four-wheeled self propelled vehicle -- With a legal license plate -- is stored here, we should call it a ‘garage’. But it is quite big, so a ‘hangar’ would also work.



There was a table in the corner of the building used for recreational means with four chairs around it. So Tatsuya went to the table and Lina followed him.



Hyougo drew a chair backwards and looked at Lina.



Tatsuya was sitting on the other side. Lina couldn’t help it, so she sat down on the chair that was prepared by Hyougo.



Hyougo then served Tatsuya and Lina tea.



Tatsuya thanked him for his help and then turned to Lina.



"So what do you want?"



Although she still was a bit hesitant, she refrained from showing that.



"I’m not a prisoner, right?"



"Of course."



“If you could, I would like you to give me back the CADs that I gave you when I came here. ”



"Why?"



Lina was looking forward to this question, but when it came to actually answering it she lacked some of the energy.



"I don’t feel safe being unarmed."



Depending on the mood of those who hear it, this disturbing dialogue could be interpreted as hostile. But in the current situation, when she was being protected by this person, she wouldn’t try to imply such a thing.



But Lina wasn’t able to come up with a convincing reason, because she was worried that she didn’t want to lie to herself and to the others, even though they probably wouldn’t get mad.



In addition, she thought that they could take advantage of her in several ways. These were the things Lina was thinking about. But if she said these things, her face would definitely become red.



"Being separated from them shouldn’t be uncomfortable."



"This is a matter of my feelings!"



In response to Lina's strong attitude, Tatsuya could do nothing but laugh. In short, Lina gave in to Tatsuya, but he didn’t think about taking advantage of it.



"Well, I think I can understand"



"Finally!"



"But I cannot agree on this request."



"What do you mean?"



“We cannot allow the USNA Army's CADs to be used in Japan, there is a possibility that they have built a tracking device into it without your knowing.”



"Wow....."



Lina returned with a comical reaction. However, she was serious about it.



“However, I have prepared alternative CAD systems for you.”



Hearing Tatsuya’s words, Lina was surprised.



"Eh? You were prepared, did you prepare them in advance?"



“I'm trying my hardest to protect you, but my opponent is the USNA. So you use it for self-defense.”



"Tatsuya ... you’re a terrible person..."



Lina was looking at him with tired eyes.



“We didn't keep it a secret, Lina was just being impatient.”



Tatsuya gave a quick response to Lina’s eyes



“You’re too much, but I guess I prefer that over this being a tense situation.”



Lina's argument would have sounded very profound, but she would be more convincing if she didn’t have a red face.



"There is a CAD adjustment facility here, so we can do it there."



"...Are you going to be doing the adjusting?"



"Don’t worry, I’m more than used to it."



"Ah... I remember, Tatsuya was part of ‘Taurus Silver’. "



"That's true."



He got up.



Lina finished her tea and chased after Tatsuya, who had already left the table.



◇ ◇ ◇



Lina and I moved from the Air-Car hanger to the adjustment facility which was next to it, while also being near the stone refinement facility. However, they didn’t use the Air-Car to get there, but rather an SUV with a hydrogen engine.



"I think I will have Lina use this."



Before entering the control room, Lena was taken to a small room that looked like a meeting room. Here, Tatsuya showed her a gold choker along with a silver bracelet.



"It doesn’t have buttons...... Maybe this is FLT’s thought-controlled device?"



"You are well informed."



Tatsuya praised Lina, but she didn’t seem to pay attention to the flattery.



"In the States, FLT’s device has been quite the popular topic..."



The CAD, which works without the usage of buttons, was first commercialized by Rosen MagiCraft in Germany, and then immediately in Japan. So a third company has yet to appear. At present, only Rosen and FLT produce these CAD systems, but FLT’s version of the fully thought controlled CAD has been dominating the market as of late.



“The USNA has tried to make their own version, but none have been as good. How does it work?”



Lina's confession was unexpected to Tatsuya. They were supposed to have the scientist who designed the Brionac with them. Tatsuya doesn’t know their name, as he doesn’t know who it is, but their scientific knowledge is clearly shown when looking at the Brionac.



If you have such technical capabilities, you should be able to develop CADs using thought. It can be argued that it won’t be long till they develop one and release it on the market.



But Tatsuya stopped thinking about that and answered her question.



“The FLT CAD system uses already developed, advanced contactless technologies that have already been commercialized.”



"Does it work using a Psion wave?"



"That's right. Because it doesn’t need to function like a Specialized CAD, it can be done using one type of Activation Sequence. This is a Non-Systemic formula for Magic Activation, which bypasses many hindrances.”



"Is that the only thing?"



“This limits the output to just one type, making it act like a switch. We can say that the thing making it works is the choker, but it isn’t the thing casting the magic."



"This is the same mechanism as a Weaponized-Integrated CAD."



When Lina pointed this out, Tatsuya confirmed this.



"The choker is structured in such a way that it acts as an auxiliary device to the bracelet."



"So, how can I differentiate what I want to cast?"



“All you need to do is incorporate the magic number you wish to use as a variable into the non-systematic magic formula, and the desired formula will be transferred to the bracelet CAD."



(T/N: This whole explanation was incredibly vague to me so I tried to make it as understandable as possible.)



"...... In other words, just by thinking ‘What magic number do I want to use?’ it will activate?"



"Roughly speaking, that is correct."



Lina was excited because magicians who engage in hand-to-hand combat usually find manipulating a CAD to be a hindrance.



CAD is a tool used to speed up the activation of Magic. By creating a Magic Sequence using a CAD, a magicians gained the ability to deal with a large number of soldiers armed with firearms.



However, this made your operating speed the decider between victory and defeat on the battlefield. A Specialized CAD can cover these shortcomings, but this would leave out a plethora of other types of magic which needed to be used.



FLT's fully thought operated CAD was a tool specifically made to solve these issues. Their devices, unlike those of Rosen, use two separate devices that work in conjunction with each other. While this may seem to be an inconvenience to use two devices, it also means that you don’t have to use your hands at all to manipulate the CAD.



“You seem to like it. The device can be connected with four CAD systems, but at least one of them needs to be a general type.”



“Clearly."



He thought that there was a possibility that the ability to manipulate both the general and specialized type CAD using one device could have gone over Lina’s head, so he mentioned it anyways.

It isn’t easy to be able to distinguish between the general and specialized type.



So he couldn’t predict what Lina would say when he mentioned it.



Tatsuya went straight to the CAD adjustment room, while Lina moved to the changing room right next to it. This facility also has the regular device that uses the headset and the hand panel, but Tatsuya found that when using a brand new CAD it should be measured using the bed-type measuring device. Lina had gone to change her clothes to prepare for this.



"Tatsuya, this... why"



Lina, who entered from the dressing room, was wearing a long white shirt without buttons, that stopped at around 15 centimeters above the knee, exposing a part of her thighs.



Her hair wasn’t tied up and fell down her back, she was also wearing slippers that you would find used in hospitals. She was also crossing her arms around her chest, while acting a bit shy and hesitant.



"...Is this alright?"



"What is alright?"



"...What I’m wearing?"



Lina was blushing and turned away because of the shame she felt after thinking about her question.



Of course, even if you show such a cure figure, Tatsuya's attitude wouldn’t change.



"Haven’t you used this type of measuring device?"



“It was obligated that we should take more precise measurements once a month.”



This means that STARS have a similar machine on base, but once a month isn’t enough in Tatsuya’s opinion. Miyuki, who’s magic power is still growing requires more precise measurements at more frequent intervals. While it will be less frequent for those in their twenties, and even more so for those above their thirties. These were Tatsuya’s thoughts.



"Would you wear a bathing suit during these measurements?"



"That isn’t going to make me wear a bikini, but..."



"I don’t care about that."



Lina was still hesitating a bit. If you thought about it normally, it wouldn’t be more embarrassing to wear a long T-shirt over a swimsuit which shows of a person’s bodily shape.



Why is she so flustered... When thinking about it, Tatsuya could only guess



Maybe Lina wasn’t wearing anything under her shirt...?



When he told her to change, Tatsuya never ordered her to ‘take off her underwear’, and there isn’t anyone in this facility that would have told her this.



But if you are Lina, who thought that underwear is normal when you use a bed type measuring device...Given that she was handed a long T-shirt, she might have thought that ‘I have to take them off’.



"...It’s fine like this."



However, he couldn’t tell Lina that ‘underwear can be worn’ right in her face. Saying such things makes both of them embarrassed. But Lina would be even more ashamed. It may be better to just let it go and ignore it.





"Well, please lie down over there."



Tatsuya was being more aware of his tone than usual.



During the examination, his suspicions deepened even further that she hadn’t worn any underwear. Tatsuya’s eyes caught evidence of it through the thin cloth, but he did not stare.



That is why Lina did not notice. Without causing any meaningless trouble, the adjustment was completed successfully.



On Lina’s neck, a choker-type device hung. No, because the device perfectly went around her neck with no excess material, the better expression would be ‘fit’. The golden glow it gave off was the same color as that of her hair, and it looked good on Lina. At first glance, it looks like a luxurious necklace, but it goes without saying that it isn’t one. Lina also noticed this, but she didn’t seem to care.



“I will be coming back tomorrow, so tell me then if there are any inconveniences.”



"OK".



Lina raised her right hand and responded to Tatsuya, with a silver bracelet on her other wrist.



"Sorry to cut you off, but the car is ready."



"I understand."



He had a bitter smile on his face and went to the hanger, where Tatsuya started the Air-Car



The car body, floating a few dozen centimeters from the ground, flew over the sea while maintaining its relative height.





◇ ◇ ◇



When Tatsuya entered Einebrise which was close to First High, Miyuki and his friends immediately spotted him.



"Oh, Tatsuya, come here."



"Tatsuya-san, we’ve been waiting!"



Erika and Honoka, welcomed Tatsuya at the same time.



He slightly raised his hand and answered them, and then set in the chair next to Miyuki.



There are no other customers in the store. Before Tatsuya came there, Miyuki had already ‘made reservations’.



"It was just a favor, Tatsuya-san."



The owner put a small glass pot on the counter with iced coffee in it. Honoka quickly got up to get the pot and brought it back to their table.



While Tatsuya started to talk, the owner said: “Call me when you’re going to leave” and retreated to the back of the store.



Ever since Tatsuya entered the cafe, he noticed magic that prevents eavesdropping. It was comparable to a sound barrier.



Everyone thought that this was necessary.



Everyone knew that Tatsuya wasn’t here for idle chit-chat, so it seems that the content is important.



“I was being careful with the owner around, so let's move on to the main subject.”



Tatsuya told them while Honoka was pouring coffee into his cup.



The eyes and ears of his friends were all turned towards Tatsuya.



"Minoru has become a parasite."



Tatsuya suddenly stated the topic of the conversation.



“What?” “You’re lying” “Are you serious?”



Erika, Leo and Mikihiko, who were acquainted with Minoru, rose up one after another.



"...Minoru, as in Minoru-kun who was Second High’s representative at the Thesis Competition?"



"That's right."



Mikihiko, who was calmly replied to by Tatsuya, was surprised.



"...Why should that be?"



Erika gave Tatsuya a sharp look.



She had no doubt that Tatsuya was telling the truth. She tried to be skeptical, but it was just matter of how these things work.



“Why, I’m not sure, but I know that Minoru has abandoned his humanity and has become a parasite.”



"Can you tell us what you know so far?"



Leo had calmed himself down immediately. However, his curiosity wasn’t inferior to Erika’s in any way.



We need to know ── This was being said by his eyes.



Although this is rarely seen in Leo, it didn’t change what Tatsuya was going to do. From the very beginning he intended to tell them about the origin of Minoru becoming a parasite.



"Him becoming one has to with the reason why Minami is hospitalized."



"...Why does that have to do with anything?”



"The reason for Minami being hospitalized has to do with her suffering significant damage to her Magic Calculation Area, which mean that she can’t fully recover."



This fact that Tatsuya has just confided in them, didn’t only surprise Leo, who asked the question, but also everyone beside Miyuki.



"Now there is no concern for her life, but when activating powerful magic, the symptoms can definitely get worse."



"...Oh."



Leo, who was lost for words, could only muster this much. Minami is a member of the Mountaineering Club, which Leo is also a part of. Among them, after Tatsuya and Miyuki, he felt closest to her.



"I don’t want to explain everything, but there is one more thing I need to talk to you guys about."



"...Why did you have to go and say that...”



When you look at Leo, who was gritting his teeth, it did not look as if he was convinced by Tatsuya’s words. But he also showed great composure even in this situation.



"Minoru became a parasite as a means to treat Minami."



"Wait, Tatsuya."



Mikihiko wasn’t able to say this next line immediately.



"...Then what you’re saying is that, Minoru-san was trying to use a parasite to treat Minami, and used himself as a guinea pig?"



"That’s what he told me himself."



"That idiot….That’s insane."



Mikihiko fell into an quiet state.



"I'm serious."



Tatsuya was ruthless in his explanation.



“In short, he tried to get Minami to do it as well?”



Erika anticipated what Tatsuya was trying to say.



"Minoru tried, but Tatsuya managed to fend him off, right?"



Leo added another question on top of the other.



"Yes, I managed to get rid of him the first time."



"Tatsuya, you... could you lose?"



"I will try not to, but he is not such an easy opponent."



Even before that question, Tatsuya never claimed that ‘he couldn’t lose’.



"That is, you won’t be beaten, but you mean that you might not be able to protect Minami, isn’t it?"



"That's right."



Erika's words highlighted the truth,



"But there is one more thing I want you to know about."



Then, he continued.



“Erika, Leo, Mikihiko. I think there is a chance that he will come in contact with you in order to get to Minami.”



"Does he want to make us his cooperators?"



"If we’re talking about people that he knows that also know Minami, you guys are most likely to comply."



"...Well, it’s true that if you hadn’t told me, I would have probably helped him."



Leo was the first to admit it.



"I wish to help Minami."



Erika also agreed.



"It is surprising that Minoru-san is a parasite, I guess it is hard to distinguish a person from a parasite."



However, Mikihiko had a dissatisfied expression. It seems that his inability to distinguish demons from people hurts his pride as an Ancient magician.



"I also didn’t know that he was a parasite until he revealed his identity himself"



"...Right."



Although you could say he is better than Tatsuya at this area, he couldn’t really say he was much better.

“Your ability to sense parasites may be higher than mine, but the Kudou family has magic that let’s them disguise their Information Body. And even though he has become a parasite, he still has the magic of ‘9’."



“No, no matter what anyone might say, I’m not sure if I can sense them better than you, so I understand that I need to stay vigilant.”



"I know I can trust you."



"By the way ..."



Erika had a ‘I'm bored’-look.



"What?"



Tatsuya did not ignore her.



"Did the parasite Minoru use come from the same place the ones before did?"



"No way, were we invaded by the United States again?"



“No, this is one of the parasite we sealed last time. The Kudou family had taken one from the ones we sealed before.”



Answering the question of Erika, Tatsuya told her this first.



"...In fact, Lina has come to Japan."



After hesitating, Tatsuya finally decided to reveal this secret.



"Lina is here?"



"Onii-sama￼."



Honoka and Miyuki raised a surprised voice.



Honoki’s astonishment is purely because Lina is visiting Japan.



Miyuki, on the other hand, was surprised that Tatsuya didn’t keep that a secret, even though they are his friends. Despite the fact that she was in public, her surprise was great enough for her to mutter ‘Onii-sama’.



Fortunately, Erika and others had also experienced a strong shock, so no one noticed that it was strange for Miyuki to call Tatsuya her brother, and not her fiancé.



"Lina’s visit to Japan has to do with the recurrence of parasites in the USNA."



The power of this massive bomb that he just dropped was so great that no one found a way to respond.



"Parasites in America..."



These were the only words Mikihiko could muster. The remaining four people, Erika, Mizuki, Leo, Honoka, were lost for words.



"The parasites I just told you about have no real connection to current situation, at the moment, but if these newly developed parasites from the USNA were to invade Japan, it could mean that they may get involved in our current fight against Minoru."



“Okay... Is there a way to disable these parasites? If you needed my strength, then..."



"I shall ask the former Head of the Kudou family for seals that we can use on the parasites."



"That honorable Kudou is an old man, isn’t he?"



"Former Head....?"



Erika and Leo point out the connection between the Kudou and Minoru and questioned his reliability.



"It is possible that I won’t like the techniques he will offer, so in that case, I shall rely on you, Mikihiko."



Tatsuya doesn’t want to rely on the techniques of the Kudou, because it is likely that Minoru is already familiar with those methods.



Undoubtedly, the Kudou family has magic that can seal parasites. Otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to create the Parasite Dolls.



But Minoru is also a Kudou magician. Of course, he may know the technique used to capture the parasites. Even now he could be trying to find a way against this method. No, any countermeasures may have already been completed. This was Tatsuya’s thinking.



"At that time, use me in any way you’d like."



Mikihiko was empowered by Tatsuya’s confidence in him.



Measures against demons - the mission of an Ancient magician. Such a conviction was held in Mikihiko’s heart.



◇ ◇ ◇



Tatsuya didn’t come to Einebrise using his amphibious car ‘Air-Car’. Once the Air-Car he used to come back from Miyaki Island was placed in the garage of his apartment, he came to the nearest station using public transportation. Naturally, this was also the way he returned home.



Neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki had much to say. It’s not impossible to be wary of eavesdropping in their current respective positions, but that isn’t the main issue. As they talked intensively before he arrived at Einebrise, the reason for his tense feelings grew stronger.



Although it is rare for these two people to come home without talking to each other, returning to their own house helped them relax. When Miyuki talked about the events that happened at school, Tatsuya talked about his impression of the Air-Car and when Miyuki asked about the drive the usual atmosphere returned.



However, the atmosphere was killed by a phone call.



It wasn’t the call itself, rather it contents.



“-- In other words, the place where Angie Sirius requested protection, the National Defense Forces wishes for her to be transferred from there?”



"I don’t want to get into a dispute."



On the video phone screen, Kazama moved his hands to appease Tatsuya.



"To hide Major Sirius who is a soldier of the USNA in a private organization, it goes without saying that the National Defense Forces can’t accept that.”



"That is reasonable. However why is Lieutenant Colonel telling me such an obvious story that I already know?"



“Tatsuya, I know that you’re protecting Major Sirous. The Yotsuba Family informed me of it."



So it’s useless to feign ignorance… Kazama said this with a gaze.



"Please make your request to the Main House."



Although Tatsuya remained indifferent. He didn’t affirm nor deny what Kazama said, nor did he nod upon the request.



Kazama’s stern eyes became visible towards Tatsuya’s non-cooperative attitude.



"Special Officer Ooguro."



From Kazama’s words, the friendly tone aimed at his younger friend disappeared.



"Even if your position has improved within the Yotsuba Family, the contract between the National Defense Forces and the Yotsuba Family concerning you is still valid."



Tatsuya silently looked at the middle of the display.



“With the exception of being Shiba Miyuki-sama’s escort, you must give priority to the orders of the National Defense Forces.”



"Lieutenant Colonel Kazama. I’m not sheltering Major Sirius. If you are saying that the Yotsuba Family are protecting Angie Sirius, please send your request to the Main House.”



"What?"



From Tatsuya's voice, Kazama was surprised.



“In addition to accompanying Miyuki, the Yotsuba Family also recognizes the priority order established with the National Defense Forces, as this is the contract that was established between the Yotsuba and the Defense Forces. However, there is no agreement that I must obey the army."



"Special Officer, are you betraying the army?"



“The position of the Special Officer was given to me by the Defense Forces when they needed me. The only thing I’ve done was swear an oath when I joined the command of the army five years ago in Okinawa."



"......Tatsuya. The Defense Forces can’t allow a civilian to protect Angie Sirius. You need to understand this."



"I do not have Major Sirius, again, if you are trying to say that the Yotsuba Family is protecting Angie Sirius, please make a request to the Main House."



In the end, both Tatsuya and Kazama avoided a definite breakdown.



This was the result of mutual recognition of the other’s value.



◇ ◇ ◇



The new building that had recently become the home of Tatsuya and Miyuki, was built as the Tokyo headquarters for Yotsuba Family. It not only included residential areas, but also included various other facilities. One such example is a room for magic training in the cellar.



There was no other person in this room. There is a reason for this, it’s because it was already late at night and he used his title as ‘son of the Family Head’ -whether or not this is true-.



Tatsuya was going to use this room to develop a magic to seal parasites. While he could learn a method from Maya, or the Kudou Family, it would most likely be a technique that he himself couldn’t use. Even if his position in the Yotsuba Family has improved, it didn’t mean he could use magic other than ‘Decomposition’ and ‘Regrowth’.



Tatsuya, however, did not give up on the possibilities he had. Of course, he couldn’t use the usual magic, except for ‘Decomposition’ and ‘Regrowth’. But by using his Artificial Magic Calculation Area, he could imitate magic at a lower level of power.



But this is when you’re talking about magic in the modern sense.



Traditionally, the ability to manipulate psions to change an event, was considered magic. Tatsuya’s ability to manipulate psions is only second to certain other gifted magicians, but it still surpasses ‘first-class’ magicians.



The body of a parasite is actually a Pushion Information Body. So there is no possibility to directly manipulate it.



However, the parasite hangs around in the body, and when it loses its pushion core, it will stop working. A pushion is the particle that is formed through thought and emotion, and at the same time it is the particle that binds the physical body to the non-physical spirit. So the spirit gives commands to the body, and in reverse, the body gives information to the spirit.



In other words, its existence interferes with the thought that the mind is an Information Body.



Outer-Systemic Magic, which directly interferes with the spirit, is activated by using a Magic Sequence that also uses spirits. This is indirect evidence that it can interact with an Information Body.



So Tatsuya was wondering if he could find a way to seal a parasite, an information body, using Outer-Systemic Magic.



If you manage to only hit the parasite with it, any physical damage would be avoided. At least this is what he came to know when he was up against parasites that weren’t in an assimilated body.



The Armor-Piercing Psion Bullet, which he created to harm the parasites that were assimilated with people, could weaken the parasite, but wasn’t able to completely incapacitate them.



(......I can’t get a clear image.)



After using several objects, which he had used previous times to get an idea, he came to the conclusion that he didn’t know what it was supposed to look like. So he felt that he needed something.



(If I could practice with the real thing, it might be a little different...)



As far as he knows, the Yotsuba and Kudou families have actual parasites. The Yotsuba’s are used for experimentation, while those of the Kudou were used for the Parasite Dolls.



(Although I probably can’t borrow any, if I remain here, it’s likely that I won’t be able come up with a proper method.)

.

However, it is also needs to be a proper technique. Because if it ends up being subpar, it will be useless. Staying here might also become a waste of time.



(...Do I have to ask Master for help?)



He didn’t want to be indebted to Yakumo, but this wasn’t the right situation to be stubborn. Tatsuya decided that he was going to visit Yakumo’s temple tomorrow.



◇ ◇ ◇



Early Tuesday morning, June 25th.



Tatsuya visited Yakumo’s temple after a long time.



He hadn’t contacted him in advance, so he wasn’t going to complain if Yakumo wasn’t here.



However, an unexpected reception was waiting for Tatsuya.



Despite his new home in Chofu not being that far away from the temple, Tatsuya took the opportunity and used his bike ‘Wingless’. He didn’t wear ordinary biking clothes, but rather his ‘Freed Suit‘ which was developed by the Yotsuba. He didn’t bring his specialized CAD this time but planned to use his fully-thought operated CAD that is integrated into his ‘Freed Suit’.



Despite the fact that he had just passed the gates, the usual fight with the disciples didn’t take place.



There were no signs of anyone being here.



Immediately after Tatsuya thought it was suspicious, something finally came to him and hit him.



However, the thing that attacked him wasn’t something physical.



And it was also showing its hostility.



He intercepted the hit using ‘Gram Dispersion’.
