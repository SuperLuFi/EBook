——Lina was unaware that her childish, cutesy gesture was further prodding Canopus’ feelings.

Somehow successfully managing to put her uneasiness in a corner of her heart, she straightened her posture and adopted——or at least she thought she had——a proper expression for someone of the military, then knocked on the door of the Commander’s Room. With a voice signaling her to come in, the lock of the door disengaged. Opening the door for herself, Lina instinctively raised her voice at the unexpected person in the room.

“Colonel Balance!?”

Right next to the commander of the base, who was behind his desk, was Colonel Virginia Balance sitting in a chair.

“Major, what are you doing. Come in.”

Ordered by the irritated voice of the base’s commander, Walker, who also had the rank of Colonel, Lina moved in front of the desk in a hurry.

Canopus followed Lina with a composed attitude.

“Major Sirius, Major Canopus, at ease.”

Walker talked to the two people who saluted in front of his desk.

“Yes.”

Lina and Canopus both adopted the resting pose simultaneously.

“Colonel Balance has something to tell to the two of you.”

Saying so, Walker stood up.

“Then, Colonel Balance.”

Virginia stood up from her seat slightly after him.

“Colonel Walker. Thank you for allowing us to borrow your room for a few moments.”

Walker and Virginia saluted each other, then Walker went out of the room.

Locking the door using the remote control, Virginia finally faced Lina.

“Major Sirius, even though I think you already figured out the reason for my presence, it’s about yesterday’s matter.”

“Yes.”

As she said, Lina had guessed that this could be related to the request she had formulated yesterday.

“It is unfortunate, however, that the Major’s request cannot be granted.”

And the answer was as Lina had expected.

“We cannot carelessly allow the High Commander of the Stars, a Strategic-Class Magician to leave the country.”

Even though she had become accustomed to this reason, she still couldn’t accept it deep in her heart. Despite the fact that she fulfilled her duty when she was sent to Japan last year, it didn’t change the fact that she really wasn’t fit for such a task.





Thinking about it, dealing with a terrorist threat in a friendly nation that was allowed to exist due to her own army’s blunder was, in fact, considered an obligation of Stars. At the very least, those were Lina’s thoughts on the matter. Even more so considering the chances of the Mastermind being a Magician were exceptionally high.

“——That is the official reason on the matter, anyhow.”

However, Lina’s displeasure at hearing this was about to skyrocket.

“The truth is, higher-ups are starting to wonder if the Major holds excess sympathy for Japan. Some are even fearing that the Major would consider exiling herself to Japan. In other words, there is an issue of trust.”

“Wait a moment! I have sworn loyalty to this nation, haven’t I?!”

“I know.”

Virginia nodded with a calm expression at a Lina who instinctively reacted.

“I am not doubting the Major’s loyalty. However, the fact you have Japanese lineage, and that you are still only a 17-year-old girl are causing them to doubt your allegiance.”

Lina was mortified. For her, having mostly an Anglo-Saxon face, experiencing what basically amounted to racism was a first.

Furthermore, considering it wasn’t face-to-face discrimination but instead being whispered behind her back, her head was starting to boil from rage.

“I can’t really find any other word than utter stupidity to qualify this.

However, it is specifically because such fools exist that we must avoid giving them any chances. Major, you are our nation’s greatest asset.”

Still, despite her enraged state of mind, Lina wasn’t so far gone that she forgot her etiquette training and completely ignored the words of a superior. Those remarks had been spoken for her sake.

“It is impossible to send Major Sirius to Japan. However, it isn’t like we can just leave this matter unattended.”

Virginia took in a breath and put power in her next sentence.

“That is why, we will send Major Canopus. Major Sirius, is this alright?”

“…Understood. I will be on standby for further orders.”

Swallowing her dissatisfaction, she saluted Virginia.

Virginia slowly nodded with a “very well”.

“In that case I will start to explain in more detail the mission to Major Canopus. Major Sirius, you may leave.”

“Yes. Then, pardon me, Colonel.”

Even though a part of Lina had wanted to explain things directly to Canopus, she had no confidence that doing so wouldn’t generate jealousy, and that was why she obediently left.



“——The situation is as stated above. Major Canopus, do you have any questions?”

After having explained to Canopus everything, from the stolen missiles to “The Seven Sages” information, Virginia inquired so.

“No, I don’t, Colonel.”

It is unknown if there will indeed be an act of terrorism in Japan, and their only source of information had been the suspicious “Seven Sages” as well. Is there any dissatisfaction to being given a mission based on such ambiguous intelligence? That had been the nuance in Virginia’s earlier question, but neither a question nor a complaint came up from Canopus.

“I see. In that case, Major Canopus, there is something I would like to ask you.”

“Yes, what is it?”

Even though Virginia carefully scrutinized Canopus’ expression, not even a brow of his twitched. Feeling relief more than disappointment, Virginia carefully continued.

“Major Canopus, no, allow me to call you Major Benjamin Lowes here.”

In the middle of Virginia’s question, Canopus’ eyebrows moved ever so slightly.

“The Major is blood-related to the Assistant of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr. Kane Lowes, right?”

“Yes. I think the Colonel is already aware but the Assistant of the Deputy Chief of Staff and my father are cousins, and he is my mother’s cousin-in-law.”

In other words, he is connected to the Lowes’ Family both by blood and marriage, and with this kind of close relationship it wouldn’t be exaggerated to say he’s part of the upper echelons of society.

“To tell you the truth, the information brought to us by ‘The Seven Sages’ isn’t limited to what I talked to you about earlier. I wish it was some kind of mistake but…”

Seeing Virginia hesitate, Canopus’ expression moved a little.

His expression had a faint “It can’t be?” feeling to it.

“It would appear that both the acquisition of the missiles and the terrorists leaving the country with them has been accommodated by the Assistant of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr. Lowes.”

“…Are you saying that the Assistant of the Deputy Chief of Staff has been corrupted by the terrorists?”

To Canopus’ question, Virginia shook her head with a gloomy expression.

“If that was all there was to it, it wouldn’t be so complicated.”

“So that means there are other points of concern?”

Virginia frowned before opening her mouth to answer.

“Truth be told, the possibility that he and the Deputy Chief of Staff decided to make use of Jiedo Heigu is higher than the corruption hypothesis.”

While Canopus couldn’t hide his shock, Virginia decided to ask him something seemingly unrelated to the matter at hand.

“Major. What do you think about the Humanist Ideology?”

A popular opinion was that “humans have to live only using human abilities”, or at least that is the doctrine that the anti-Magician Catholic cults go by. Again, this was a mere excuse to agitate the anti-Magician sentiment.

However, Canopus’ answer would be even more concise.

“Mass hysteria. Still, to effectively use this, it would require influence as well as extreme prudence, I think.”

“As a Magician yourself, don’t you feel threatened by all of that?”

“If it seemed like it was about to escalate then I do think some measures should be thought of. We Magicians have no reason to bow down to false charges after all.”

“…You seem to possess pretty radical opinions.”

“Colonel, you’re misunderstanding something. I only think that it would be dangerous for the citizens if society didn’t allow them self-defense.

Those calumnious would-be victims incite racism and discrimination, something that has a high risk of breaking down any country, ours included, so we shouldn’t take it lightly.”

“I understand your stance. But that is not the problem at hand.”

While saying this, Virginia had an unpleasant expression.

“Lowes, the Assistant of the Deputy Chief of Staff, has a different thought process but appears to have arrived at the same conclusion as you.”

Even though Virginia was peering into Canopus’ expression, he kept a cool, if somewhat brazen, expression.

“However, this is the country of freedom. It is a necessity to guarantee freedom of speech. No matter how good the cause, we cannot suppress it. At the very least, politicians think so.”

“I agree with this, Colonel.”

“…That is where the group Lowes belongs to decided to act, and they planned on giving the Humanists a target other than them, another country.”

“So that they can perform their act of terrorism in Japan, and feel satisfied enough to not do it here as well?”

“Your sarcasm is unneeded, Major. This is something I don’t agree with.”

Virginia reproved with a sour look, a Canopus that was wearing a smile full of derision.

“Forgive my rudeness, Colonel.”

Thinking that he had gone too far, Canopus genuinely apologized.

Seeing Canopus apologizing, Virginia realized that she might have been too high-strung herself and decided to resume the conversation.

“Putting that aside, if the information given by ‘The Seven Sages’ is to be trusted, Lowes’ group’s objective isn’t even the terrorist act itself.”

“In other words?”

“It is nigh-impossible to limit the damage of a terrorist bombing to only the planned targets. Citizens will also unfortunately get involved in this.”

“That is…”

It was the first time since entering this room that Canopus wore such an expression.

“With this kind of weaponry, it would be impossible to harm a Magician unless they were taken by surprise. However, if you were to prepare a bomb using tens of those missiles’ destructive power, it would be difficult even for Members of the Ten Master Clans of Japan. Although a high-ranked Magician could definitely survive the explosion with a heatproof barrier, the civilians who happen to be in the area wouldn’t have a chance. If the explosion came from all directions, then even protecting the innocent would be next to impossible. As a result, only the civilians would suffer casualties. This was the scenario envisioned by ‘The Seven Sages’.”

“And since Magicians of Japan let innocent civilians die under their very eyes, the Humanists would take them as their new target. Their energy would be concentrated on Japan, thus, the anti-Magician movement in our own country would weaken. Moreover, the risk of Humanists resorting to radical measures out of frustration would decrease, is that it?”

“Indeed.”

Canopus’ eyes had a sharp light to them.

“In that case, my mission will be to restrain Jiedo Heigu’s act of terrorism before it happens?”

“What I ask of you is in fact much more than that.”

Virginia took a provocative stance.

“After last year’s Parasite Affair, the Japanese authorities definitely won’t see us in a good light. It will probably be impossible to capture Heigu on Japanese soil without alerting them. That will lead to an inquiry as to why we captured Heigu, and then they’ll discover the weapons he planned on using had come from us.

However, if this act of terrorism actually succeeds, the origin of the used weapons will probably be discovered as well. I think that it would be much more disadvantageous to not stop it beforehand.

The difference between losing weapons and having them purchased from a black market by a terrorist versus letting a terrorist steal our weapons is quite vast.”

“…So we’re going to let innocent Japanese citizens be massacred?”

“I have already secretly warned Japanese Magicians about Jiedo Heigu’s group of terrorists.”

It wasn’t as if Canopus could completely agree with Virginia. However, he couldn’t dispute the fact that there was a need for the USNA Army to cover their position. Before being a Magician, Canopus was a military man. This fact was one of the biggest differences between him and the virtuous Lina.

“Major. Your duty is not related to the execution of Jiedo Heigu’s act of terrorism, whether it is before it happens or afterwards, your mission is to assassinate him. His plans will probably still be realized even if he is killed, but you need not worry about that. According to ‘The Seven Sages’, Heigu doesn’t seem to be using aerial transports. If he is on the sea, you may use ‘loud’ means to get the work done. Do not allow the Japanese to capture him.”

“Understood.”

Faced with the image of a saluting Canopus accepting the duty bestowed upon him, Virginia couldn’t help but feel guilty.

“Forgive me, Major. Even though we understand this kind of dirty work isn’t part of your duties, considering the possibility of our opponent being a peculiar Magician is high, we need to meet him with an eminent Magician of our own.”

Canopus stopped saluting and without putting on a tough act, shook his head.

“You need not worry yourself, Colonel. If anything, I would like to express my gratitude for choosing me. I do not want the High Commander… I don’t want Lina to suffer the pain of assassination work, as much as I can help it.”

Saluting once again, Canopus left the commander’s room.




Canopus arrived at the Japan-USNA Joint-Base of Yokosuka on January 29th, 1800 hours, Japan standard time.

Due to the frequent wars throughout the world over a 20-year period, most countries decided to call back all their troops to their respective territories, thus, things like the U.S. Forces’ Bases in Japan had disappeared. However, after the U.S became the USNA, the alliance between them and Japan had continued, but changed. Each country installed bases on their lands, bases that could be used freely by the other nation. The base of Yokosuka was one of those. (That being said, those bases’ activities were close to nonexistent).

Of course, the fact that the Stars First Unit Commander, Canopus, came to Japan remained a secret. Immediately after arriving, without even going out of the base, he went on a destroyer ship towards the sea.

The warship that Canopus was on headed south, towards the Sagami Bay, and it passed by a small cruiser of 20 meters in the middle of the sea area between the Boso Peninsula and Oshima. Canopus jumped from the destroyer to the small cruiser when the two were close enough. This boat had been camouflaged using Optical Magic which could reflect even infrared rays. Although a faint shadow would probably appear on stratospheric surveillance cameras, discerning its identity should be impossible. With this, Canopus could be smuggled into the country safely.

This small cruiser was originally something that the USNA embassy possessed for leisure purposes, thus, to use it for information gathering, its power output and the hull’s outer armor had been reinforced. Of course, cutting-edge sensors had been installed as well. Despite the fact that this cruiser didn’t have many weapons, so long as Canopus was on it, this wouldn’t be a problem at all.

Canopus turned the cruiser towards Sagami Bay. The cruiser went south, following the Izu Peninsula, then at Cape Irozaki turned north towards the Suruga Bay. Due in part to the slow speed at which he sailed, it was already nearing midnight when he found the target ship.

It was a small freighter which had its deck entirely covered with solar panels. When sailing, the arms on each of the sides of the hull would open up, like a Tobiuo’s wings, and the thin solar films would then increase the power generation. This auxiliary power source uses a photocatalytic hydrogen production model built into a regular fuel cell, and with nearly all the energy required coming from the sun, this type of freighter had become the main transport model in the latter half of the 21st century.

This freighter had been mentioned along with the presumed date at which Jiedo Heigu left the USNA. However, this ship was supposed to arrive yesterday in Japan. That is why the ship’s inspection was unnecessary, so they decided to search the port at which it had anchored.

“Major, is it that ship?”

The captain of the ship who served as an officer in the USNA’s Marine Corps talked to Canopus with a mix of awe and fear in his voice. As a temporary subordinate under his command for this mission, he had been told about Canopus’ background. The Stars were already a unit whose reputation was close to that of legendary, and factor in that he was now talking to one of its best field officers, and you get that result. Albeit, this captain wasn’t aware that “Canopus” the Number 2, was right behind “Sirius”, so he didn’t need to be that tense. If he had been aware of Canopus’ rank, it was quite possible that he wouldn’t have been able to focus on his work to begin with.

To the captain’s question, Canopus expressed a bitter smile. Seeing this smile without an ounce of intimidation or malice, the captain’s tension softened a little.

“My apologies but ships really aren’t my forté. You guys should have much more expertise on this subject than I do, right?”

Understanding that Canopus implicitly asked “Isn’t this something you of all people should bring answers to?”, the captain straightened his spine.

“Pardon me, Sir. There is no mistake that this is the ship in question.”

“Of course, I will trust you on this matter.”

Canopus adopted a serious look and nodded, and a breath of relief escaped from the captain’s lips.

“Captain.”

“Yes, Major?”

The captain answered with a tone fitting of the serious expression Canopus was wearing.

“Keep that ship under surveillance. Since Heigu brought this ship all the way from Yokosuka to Numazu, he might be tempted to use it again to escape.”

“Understood. I will immediately contact local agents.”

“We will continue observing the vessel tonight.”

“Major, aren’t you going to the mainland?”

“We’re already past the planned time for landing. If we are to successfully complete this mission, we must avoid drawing attention as much as possible.”

“Sir, yes, sir!”

Nodding silently, Canopus turned his attention towards the freighter.




Persuaded by Virginia, Lina graciously decided to give up on going to Japan. She thought that sending Canopus wasn’t a mistake. Thinking about it, if they were to exclude Heavy Metal Burst, he might even be stronger than her, Sirius, since he was a veteran combat Magician. Lina kept repeating to herself that he never failed his duties.

Still, Lina had come to a point where it was unbearable to not do anything.

“…It’s true, I cannot do anything. I have to obediently remain here.

However, if it’s about warning a fri… an acquaintance, then there should be no problem!”

Despite the fact that no one was listening to her monologue, she felt the need to hurriedly correct herself before she could utter the word “friend”.

Looking left and right with a red face, no matter how you looked at it, it was her excessive self-consciousness.

Was she aware that her actions were a bit childish? Lina cleared her throat——which was quite a cutesy act in and of itself anyway——and looked towards the vision console.

It was currently two hours past midnight. In other words, that meant Lina had been worrying until that time, but it also meant that it was just six o’clock in Japan. Even though that wasn’t planned at all, it was just what she hoped for.

Although she had decided to phone them, if she gave herself the time to hesitate, it would have been too late. Lina psyched herself up in front of the console and dialed Miyuki’s number.

After five blips, the screen’s light turned on. Looking at the display, her rival appeared, and compared to a year ago, her beauty had even further increased.

[My! Lina, it’s been a while.]

Neither envy, fear, reverence nor admiration transpired from her gaze, and she was only looking at the person named “Angelina”. Lina remembered the illusion of the water concealing her heart melting away.

“Hello, Miyuki. It’s been awhile indeed. Is everything going well?”

[Yes, thanks to you. Did you lose some weight I wonder? Are you alright? Aren’t you busy with your work?]

Calling her role as the Stars’ High Commander, the duty of the Sirius, as just “work”. This spontaneous boldness gave Lina pleasant feelings.

“My weight actually increased you know? Maybe I became more muscular.”

[Hmm… It looks like you did shape up a bit. I’m a little jealous.]

“Miyuki… I told you that when someone such as yourself talks like that, it sounds like sarcasm. Moreover, what’s up with you? Getting even more beautiful like that. When are you going to feel satisfied and stop?”

[I could say the same to you, it really sounds like sarcasm when you say such things… If it seems like I look beautiful, then it’s only because of Onii-sama.]

Lina suddenly had dejected feelings. Really, if the situation had been different… such thoughts wandered in Lina’s head, feelings of disappointment.

“…Ah that’s true, Miyuki is now engaged to Tatsuya, right. Congratulations.”

[Thank you very much, Lina. Still, the news spread pretty fast it seems.]

“Well, we’re talking about the ‘Princess’ of the Yotsuba. It’s normal to bear an interest.”

[Is that true? Then could it be that Lina called to congratulate us?]

Lina was taken aback by Miyuki’s happy smile. And with this she remembered the purpose of her call.

“Umm, no, sorry. It’s not really for that.”

Hearing Lina’s apology, Miyuki slightly cocked her head to the side, but rather than being ill-humored, she was puzzled.

[Oh my, in that case, is it an important matter?]

Lina wanted to ask why Miyuki would show her such a cutesy face, but refrained from doing so and swallowed her retort.

“Indeed. It’s probably a very important matter.”

[…Would it be better if I called Onii-sama I wonder?]

Thinking for less than a second, Lina nodded her head at Miyuki’s proposal.

“Yes. It would be better for Tatsuya to hear this as well.”

[Please, wait for a moment.]

The screen entered suspension mode.

It took roughly three seconds for the display to turn on again, and for Miyuki’s beautiful figure to reappear.

[Lina, long time no see.]

“Yes, Tatsuya. It has been a long time.”

Tatsuya was sitting next to Miyuki. To Lina’s surprise, the distance between Tatsuya and Miyuki wasn’t zero.

[I guess this would be the time where we slowly talk about how things have been going around each other, but you seem to have important business to talk about. Let’s leave the friendship talk for the next time, then. What did you want to consult us about.]

“You haven’t changed, Tatsuya. I must say, I like that straightforward personality of yours.”

Immediately after saying this, Lina thought “Damn it”. Using “I like” to qualify an aspect of Tatsuya while Miyuki is right next to him, isn’t that like pouring fuel on the already lit fire that is called “Miyuki’s jealousy”.

However, once again unexpectedly, Miyuki remained calm and composed.

This was incredibly eerie to Lina.

“Umm… Miyuki. Aren’t you angry?”

[Eh, about what?]

Miyuki replied with a face that explicitly told she had no idea what Lina was talking about.

From Miyuki’s point of view, it was natural that other women would be attracted to him, or at least find likeable points about him, so there was no reason to get angry about such trivial matters. Lina wasn’t aware of that fact however.

“Well, let’s forget about it.”

If she doesn’t care about it then there’s no reason to press the issue.

Thanks to that, Lina was able to get down to business.

“Tatsuya, Miyuki, do you remember about ‘The Seven Sages’?”

Tatsuya and Miyuki looked at each other.

[We remember.]

The one who answered was Tatsuya.

[Have you received some information from those Seven Sages?]

While picturing Raymond Clark’s face, Tatsuya asked Lina this question. There should be no way for her to know about “The Seven Sages” identity. Never mind that Raymond was one of them.

“Spot on.”

As Lina didn’t have any telepathy or unusual mind powers, she couldn’t see what image went through Tatsuya’s mind at the moment. Lina also didn’t have observation powers on a level where she could see through Tatsuya’s poker face.

“According to the information we received from them, remnants of Dahan have planned an act of terrorism in Japan.”

Having received an answer to her own question, she answered Tatsuya’s.

“The Mastermind is someone named Jiedo Heigu. His Chinese name is Gu Jie. He is a presumed surviving Magician from the Kunlunfang Institute… What’s wrong Miyuki?”

Miyuki was about to raise her voice but quickly held it in, and having seen that, Lina inquired for the reason of her response.

[The name Kunlunfang Institute holds a very special meaning for us… Forgive me for interrupting you.]

The truth was that they had heard this name already from Raymond, that he was another member of “The Seven Sages”, Miyuki quickly covered up with a lie as Tatsuya didn’t have any reaction.

“Ah, I see…”

Lina knew about the connection between the Yotsuba and the Kunlunfang Institute. Considering it normal for the Yotsuba Successor to react vividly at the mention of a “Kunlunfang Institute Survivor”, Lina didn’t press the issue.

“You might have already guessed, but we think that the possibility of the Yotsuba being Heigu’s target is pretty high.”

[I see. Indeed, this line of thought seems to be the most plausible. Is that the reason Lina contacted Miyuki?]

“W-well, yeah, that’s how it is.”

Hearing Tatsuya say “I think the same”, Lina started to blush without any particular reason.

[It’s true that both Miyuki and I are related to this matter. There is also the possibility that Miyuki would be directly targeted.]

“Tatsuya… Don’t talk as if it’s someone else’s problem. There is a possibility that you could become a target as well.”

To a Lina who stated so with an amazed voice,

[It would be convenient if I was their target.]

Tatsuya answered with a fearless expression.

“…Well, I guess so. If they make you their target, I guess things would be wrapped up in short order.”

Hearing his answer, Lina instinctively consented.

Even Lina didn’t understand the extent of Tatsuya’s true power. Even though, at first, she had thought that he was a Magician skilled in Mental-Interference Magic, she came to doubt that assessment during their final battle with the Parasites.

In a word, Tatsuya was, and still is a mysterious Magician. However, if anything, Lina couldn’t question his ability. Lina couldn’t even imagine how Magicians who had no choice but to rely on the little missiles they stole would go about dealing Tatsuya.

[Lina, what’s wrong? You have the face of someone who just lost all her worries.]

Lina violently jumped up at Miyuki casually revealing her thoughts.

Why was she feeling so relieved after confirming that Tatsuya wouldn’t be done in so easily.

“No, well, you know.”

Hampered by the noisy sound her heart was making, she couldn’t form a proper sentence.

“You see, how should I say it…”

Looking at the wry smile of Tatsuya, Lina remembered how irritating it could be.

“Ah, geez! See, to sum up, I just wanted to.”

To tell you about Heigu, was what she was about to say, but she managed to seal her lips right before saying it.

[I see… In other words, you were in such a hurry to tell us about Heigu that once you did what you called for, you felt relieved, is that it?]

“Yeah, that’s right!”

Lina showed quite the grand reaction to the figurative lifeboat that Tatsuya sent her.

“Ah…”

While Lina was rapidly getting redder,

[I see. Lina, thank you very much.]

Tatsuya ignored it and expressed his thanks to Lina.

“Y-you don’t need to thank me! I just thought that if I didn’t tell you guys I’d have trouble sleeping, that’s all! Well then, Tatsuya, Miyuki, good night!”

Forgetting the time difference between their countries, Lina cut off the transmission after rapidly saying her goodbye.

She violently took off her clothes and slipped between the sheets without even putting on her pajamas.





Chapter 5




A week had passed since Tatsuya and Miyuki had received that phone call from Lina.

Lina’s communication had been last Tuesday, and since today was Monday, six days had passed. There were still no clues about the terrorist attack or Heigu. This was the case not only for Tatsuya, but also Maya and Canopus as well, none of whom had made progress in the search for Heigu.

Furthermore, today was February 4th. The Master Clans Conference would be held in two days’ time.

The Master Clans Conference is the summit for the Japanese Magic Community. Even for Ancient Magicians who didn’t even accept the Ten Master Clans as the Leaders of Magicians, they couldn’t deny the influence of the Master Clans Conference. Especially this year, the Ten Master Clans Selection Meeting would be held on the second day. It would decide the next Ten Master Clans for the next 4 years, which heightened the Magician’s concerns even more.

The students of First High, too, were restless since early morning.

Though they were only High School Students, being Magicians themselves, they couldn’t help being concerned. Especially for people who are related to the Ten Master Clans and the 18 Assistant Houses, or people associated with the Ten Master Clans whose probability for selection was low, were anxious to the point of being incapable of concentrating in school.

As Miyuki entered Class 2-A, the students reacted by freezing in shock, and silence fell upon the room.

“Good morning, Shizuku, Honoka.”

Miyuki greeted Shizuku in the seat in front and Honoka standing adjacent to Shizuku. With a greeting, she removed the spell on her classmates.

“Miyuki!? Why did you come to school!?”

Honoka let out a voice similar to a scream. With that, Class 2-A was filled with the loud buzz of commotion.

“Why… Isn’t today a weekday. For a High School Student to come to school is a given, isn’t it? Or since when have I been ostracized by my friends? Or could it be bullying?”

Miyuki tilted her head with one hand on her cheek, making a troubled expression.

In response to the unexpected counter-attack, Honoka was bewildered.

Shizuku too had a face which indicated that she had no idea as to how she could assist her.

However, the troubles of the two did not continue for long.

“I apologize, that was a joke.”

A quick smile slipped out of Miyuki that turned into a giggle.

“I thought you would be absent? Today’s the Master Clans Conference after all.”

“Y-Yeah!”

Honoka who followed-up, anxiously drew closer to Miyuki.

“Miyuki, is it fine to not go to the Conference? After all, this time, they’re holding the selection meeting, too? Since you’re the successor, ah…”

Honoka covered her mouth with her hand, showing an expression that she messed up.

The classmates who heard this, turned away all at once.

“Even though I would prefer it if you weren’t so bothered about it…”

Miyuki put on a smile of embarrassment. But the classmates who, until recently, were concerned about her, couldn’t help but worry about her attendance.

“So Miyuki, is it okay to not go?”

Following Miyuki’s statement, Shizuku asked a rather bland question to break the sour mood.

“Well, I wasn’t invited to go.”

As Miyuki answered while smiling, gazes which seemed to say “Eh?” gathered around her.

“I wonder if Honoka and Shizuku don’t know this. The venue of the Master Clans Conference is a secret to everyone except the attendees. For the 18 Assistant Houses attending the Selection Meeting, as of today, they are only informed about the approximate location, with the specifics about the room being used still unknown.”

“But Miyuki is…”

To Honoka revealing her surprise, Miyuki pleasantly smiled.

It paralyzed Honoka’s tongue and throat.

“I wasn’t invited. Thus, I don’t even know where the meeting will take place. It’s not that I take no interest in the contents of the meeting but if I don’t even know the general location, there’s no way I can go, right?”

“That’s true.”

In place of Honoka who had started blushing quietly, Shizuku nodded in agreement to Miyuki’s words.



At the same time, something similar was happening in Class 2-E.

“Hmm? Tatsuya-san, why did you come to school?”

“Good morning, Mizuki. To greet me with such a question in the morning.”

“Eh, ah, no, about that… I’m sorry.”

It wasn’t that Tatsuya particularly felt uncomfortable but for him to say such a thing was natural. Tatsuya had never taken long periods of absence from school, so to be questioned, “Why did you come to school”, on a Monday, the question coming out of nowhere was nothing less than a rarity.

But on this day, it wasn’t just Mizuki who seemed to have forgotten her common sense.

“Tatsuya-kun, is it alright for you to come to school!?”

Opening the window noisily, Erika cried out loud without any prior greeting.

“Erika… why do you all want me to be absent?”

The sight of Tatsuya frowning in displeasure, beside an embarrassed Mizuki entered Erika’s sight.

“A, ahahahahahahaha.”

Realizing her attitude to be a little senseless, she revealed a false smile.

Some things were impossible, even for her.

“But still, Tatsuya. Isn’t today the start of the Master Clans Conference? Is it fine to not go there?”

Fortunately for Erika, she wasn’t the only one who dared to venture into the minefield.

“Why would you want to know?”

In response to Leo’s question, without trying to play the fool, Tatsuya curiously asked a question of his own.

“I think that to not be interested would be strange.”

As Erika replied to Tatsuya’s question, Leo nodded his head in agreement.

“These two are really getting along now,” Tatsuya thought while putting out another question.

“As I said, why? Well, it does seem the amount of interested people is rather numerous but…”

While saying that, Tatsuya glanced backwards, and his classmates hurriedly averted their eyes.

“If you think that my relation to the Yotsuba Family is a good enough reason, then you would be mistaken. Just because a person is blood-related to the Ten Master Clans does not mean he or she can participate in the Master Clans Conference. For example, as the successor of the Juumonji Family, Juumonji-senpai attending is a given but, Saegusa-senpai is unlikely to be attending.”

“…So that’s how it works?”

Leo wore a face that lost interest. Conversely, Erika had an expression that seemed to express her content.

“Therefore, even if I did know the location of the conference, I’m not interested in going. In the middle of the conference, rather than to be bored waiting, it would be more beneficial to go to school and take lessons.”

“But still, aren’t you interested in the contents discussed in the Master Clans Conference?”

“I’m not allowed to attend, so even if I wanted to go now, I have no way of doing so. All the results of the conference will be publicized. There’s no way for me to know the process of the discussion.”

“Haa… in the end, we only need to follow the announcement huh?”

“That is indeed the case.”

If the discussion ended here, it would have been resolved under the category of small talk.

“In the end, powerless small fry Magicians can only follow something you decided? That sounds like something Ten Master Clans-sama would say.”

A loud monologue resounded throughout the quiet classroom which had been listening to Tatsuya.

The source was diagonally behind Tatsuya. More accurately, it was diagonally behind Mizuki.

“What? You have something you want to say?”

Using her sharp eyes, Erika glared at Hirakawa Chiaki, the student who had voiced such words.

Chiaki didn’t answer Erika’s question. If that was the extent of her reaction, it would have ended fine. But, Chiaki looked away.

Erika’s eyes twitched upwards at the provocation.

Erika, who was at the window, walked in through the door. Then, she headed towards Chiaki.

“Wait a moment! Chiba-san, calm down!”

The one who hastily blocked Erika’s way was a male student.

Not yielding to Erika’s spirit, he tried to resolve the situation peacefully as if he was the class rep. The student in question was Tomitsuka, a man who fit the definition of a worry-wart.

“Tomitsuka-kun, could you stand down? I have something to say to that girl.”

“No, that will definitely end badly!”

Tomitsuka, who certainly understood what Erika meant by “something to say”, tried desperately to dissuade Erika.

But, as if to ruin his efforts, Chiaki stood up behind Tomitsuka.

“Isn’t it true?”

“What?”

Over the shoulder of Tomitsuka, the two girls glared at each other.

“Chiba-san, err, lessons will be starting soon…?”

Acting like a shield for Chiaki, Tomitsuka still tried to arbitrate the issue.

“There’s still 5 minutes.”

But was tragically shot down.

“So, Hirakawa-san, answer me?”

The intensity of Erika’s gaze was such that it could even cause a grown man to shudder.

Chiaki’s knees were currently trembling, but she still bravely replied.

“The fact he’s related to the Ten Master Clans! Are you telling me I’m wrong?!”

“And? It may be true that Tatsuya-kun is related to the Ten Master Clans, so what? Even if someone’s parents are from the Ten Master Clans, the children aren’t necessarily involved as well.”

“Sophistry. Chicanery. Being a member of the Yotsuba Family behind our backs, he hid it and deceived us!”

“Perhaps a young girl who was fortunately brought up in a normal household may not know, but children who do not take their parents’ surnames is not a rare occurrence in the Magician Community.”

Chiaki’s tongue was tied and she was unable to reply due to the fact she knew Erika was telling the truth. That fact was common knowledge.

“Wha-Why…”

“Nn? If you have something you want to say, just be out with it.”

Erika’s contemptuous tone angered Chiaki. Rage broke any reason left in her.

“Chiba-san, why are you getting angry because of that guy!? Do you like him or something!?”

The classmates who had been spectating the argument frowned. This was because Chiaki’s reasoning was sorely lacking in dignity for a High School Student. To put it crudely, “Whether someone likes someone or not, what does it matter? Aren’t you being an idiot?” was what they felt.

“Are you an idiot?”

Erika spoke those thoughts aloud.

“Do I like Tatsuya-kun? I’m not so reckless.”

Hearing Erika’s objection the students of Class 2-E tilted their necks in puzzlement.

“To be a love rival against Miyuki, I’ve seen the horrors it can bring. I’d rather not risk my life in such a dangerous scenario for love.”

If Miyuki had heard her, the situation wouldn’t have ended so simply.

Even sympathizing with that statement would be dangerous. But, excluding Tatsuya, Chiaki and Tomitsuka——In short the spectating students of Class 2-E——deeply nodded in agreement at Erika’s words.

“Ah, to seriously argue against such a dolt, I must look like quite the fool.”

Saying that, Erika briskly walked out.

“Tatsuya-kun, I’ll be returning. See you next time.”

“Ah, see you next time.”

Returning a wave to Tatsuya, she smiled and left Class 2-E.

The end result was that Chiaki successfully drove off Erika.

But Chiaki was left standing and trembling in embarrassment.




For High School Students, the conference might seem like something casual, but for the participating adults, the Master Clans Conference is nothing less than a serious duel, which concerned their very lives.

The venue was in Hakone, held in a rented conference room in a luxurious hotel. As the start of the meeting approached, the seats of the round table were filled.

Casually dressed in a copper brown sweater, that wrapped his tall and sunburnt body, was the cutthroat Head of the Ichijou Family, Ichijou Gouki. Residing in Kanazawa, he had recently celebrated his 42nd birthday a few days ago. His occupation was being a Seabed Mining Company President.

With her hair tied up, and donning an elegant kimono, was the Head of the Futatsugi Family, Futatsugi Mai. Residing in Ashiya, 55 years old. She was a major shareholder of a Food Industry Company.

Wearing a jacket on top of a polo shirt, coupled with a rough look, was the petite yet athletic middle-aged Head of the Mitsuya Family, Mitsuya Gen. Residing in Atsugi, 53 years old. He, for lack of a nice way of putting it, was an International Arms Dealer.

Enveloped in a wine red formal one piece was the beautiful Head of the Yotsuba Family, Yotsuba Maya. No matter how one looked at it she looked to be only 30 years of age, but she is actually 47 years old.

Neatly dressed but also having a plain appearance, like an unrefined businessman was the Head of the Itsuwa Family, Itsuwa Isami. Residing in Uwajima, 49 years old. He was the director and the owner, of a Shipping Company.

Short, yet straight, brown hair, and wearing a pantsuit, the glamorous woman was the Head of the Mutsuzuka Family, Mutsuzuka Atsuko. Residing in Sendai, 29 years old. She was the owner of a Geothermal Power Plant Excavation Company.

Somewhat old fashioned and reminiscent of the elite businessmen of the 1980’s to 1990’s, was the Head of the Saegusa Family, Saegusa Kouichi. Residing in Tokyo, 48 years old. Wearing lightly colored spectacles, even indoors, was a characteristic trait of his. He is a Venture Capitalist.

Wearing a three-piece suit without a tie and his hair gathered up, was the Head of the Yatsushiro Family, Yatsushiro Raizou. Residing in Fukuoka, 31 years old. He was a lecturer in at a university and a major shareholder of a Multi-Communication Company.

Dressed in an overseas brand three-piece, the white-haired gentleman was the Head of the Kudou Family, Kudou Makoto. Residing in Ikoma, 64 years old. He was the shareholder, investor and creditor of various Military Industrial Companies.

The bald man in full formal Japanese attire, a haori hakama, was the Head of the Juumonji Family, Juumonji Kazuki. Residing in Tokyo, 44 years old. He was the owner of a Civil Engineering and Construction Company that has a connection with the National Defense Force.

These were the current Ten Master Clans, and their respective Heads. In addition, only Juumonji Kazuki was accompanied by his son, Katsuto.

Once all the members were present, the door closed. The one who locked the door was the youngest of them all, Katsuto.

“Juumonji-dono, has your condition improved?”

The first to speak was the eldest, Kudou Makoto.

All Families were equal within the Ten Master Clans. There was no hierarchy of any sort. Such a belief was obvious due to the usage of a round table in the hotel.

But to carry out a meeting without a chairperson was unconducive. So among the Family Heads, it had become an unwritten law that the eldest would have the role of facilitating the meeting.

Makoto inquiring about Juumonji Kazuki’s health condition was due to the fact that previously he had been absent from the Master Clans Conference, with Katsuto going in his place. For the other Heads, it had been actually 3 years since their last meeting with Kazuki.

“In regards to that, I have an announcement to make to everyone.”

Hearing Makoto’s words, Kazuki stood up. Speaking while seating was the standard in the Master Clans Conference so his attitude seemed to give the feeling that it was an important announcement.

“This may be sudden but, I, Juumonji Kazuki, will use this meeting as a means of handing over the seat of Head of the Juumonji Family to my son Katsuto. With that in mind, I would like all of you present to bear witness.”

Exchanging glances with surrounding members, while staring at Kazuki, each Head had varied responses but, not one of them freely chattered.

“That is quite a brash thing to say.”

Makoto said on behalf of all the other members present.

“I have been considering this for quite some time. Having reached adulthood, I believe Katsuto has also been thinking about it. Occupying the seat of the Head and having no ability as a Magician… such a thing, not only speaking for the Juumonji Family, but for the Ten Master Clans, would not be desirable. Thus I’ve made such a decision.”

“You mean to say, you can no longer use magic?”

The person who asked this was Ichijou Gouki. In the Master Clans Conference, difficult topics that had to be broached were numerous.

“Since 3 years ago, I have been suffering from a disease that has caused a decline in my magic power. 2 years ago, I was at the stage where I could no longer fight, as such virtually left all the duties of being Head to Katsuto. And then 3 months ago, I lost all use of my magical abilities.”

Kazuki’s explosive message reverberated amongst everyone.

“A sickness that causes a decline in magic? This is the first time I heard of such a thing. I know this is impolite but, as a Magician this is a big problem. Do you have more information? Are there no cures?”

The person asking was Saegusa Kouichi. For him, when in the Master Clans Conference, talking came first and the debate second.

“Saegusa-dono, such a worry is unnecessary. For it is unique to the Juumonji Family.”

“Unique only to your family? Are you sure?”

“Saegusa-dono.”

As Kouichi tried to question further, he was softly chided by Maya.

“It would be better if you refrain from asking anything more than that.”

“That is true. Do not pry into the business of other families. That is a rule not only followed by the Ten Master Clans, but the Magic Community as a whole. It is as Yotsuba-dono says, shall we cease such questioning? Juumonji-dono has already said that Magicians of other families will not catch such a disease, isn’t that good enough?”

Futatsugi Mai followed up on Maya’s opinion. After Kudou Makoto, as the next eldest, she held the role of being the arbitrator during the Master Clans Conference.

“Very well, I understand. Juumonji-dono, I apologize for my actions.”

Kouichi withdrew quietly. Let alone Maya, he had no reason to be stubborn towards Mai.

“No, I don’t really mind it.”

As Kouichi replied as such, Kazuki faced Maya and Mai and showed gratitude with his eyes.

“Now then, everyone. Are there any opinions about the Juumonji’s Succession?”

About Kazuki’s question,

“Even without our presence, I know it would be fine for the Juumonji’s Family matters to be settled internally, but… I have no objections. I would happily bear witness to the succession of Katsuto-dono.”

“I too have no objections. Rather, I think it’s quite an honor. I would happily be a witness.”

As Maya raised her volume, Mutsuzuka Atsuko continued. Atsuko had an admiration for Maya, so often when disputes broke out, she would often take Maya’s side. One of the Yotsuba Branch Families, the Shibata Family’s eldest son, Katsushige commuted to Sendai’s Fifth High School. Such a thing was partially due to the friendliness of Atsuko to Maya.

“I have no intention to protest against other family’s succession matters. I wish Katsuto-dono the best of luck in his future role as the Head. It’s unfortunate for Kazuki-dono, but, for putting forth so much effort for the Japanese Magic Community, thank you for your hard work.”

Perhaps because of what happened earlier, Kouichi actively showed his support.

With both Maya and Kouichi accepting Kazuki’s proposal in concert, the remaining Heads congratulated Katsuto, and gave words of appreciation for Kazuki.

“Now Katsuto-dono. As the new Head of the Juumonji Family, please sit in that seat.”

Lastly, Makoto prompted Katsuto, recognizing him as the Head of the Juumonji Family.



Sent by Katsuto to this room, Kazuki left the room, Katsuto sat in the seat for the Head of the Juumonji Family. With that adjustment, the Master Clans Conference began.

“Then Ichijou-dono.”

“The mountain recesses of the Hokuriku-San’in regions have seen no movement that might become a problem. There have been no signs observed that the New Soviet Union and the Great Asian Alliance are working on an intrusion.”

Prompted by Makoto, Gouki made a report on the observations of the activities of opposing governments.

“Mutsuzuka-dono.”

“The Tōhoku region has seen no irregularities.”

“Futatsugi-dono.”

“Hanshin is as usual. Should there be any eyesores, I will immediately set out to clean it up.”

“…Futatsugi-dono, be careful. Itsuwa-dono.”

“No movements have been observed in the Shikoku region.”

“Yatsushiro-dono.”

“Much like the Hanshin region, the Kitakyushu region is as usual.”

“Is that so? Keep a look out and be careful.”

This report was in regards to the activities in the areas which each family was in charge of. The Hokkaidō, Ogasawara and Okinawa regions were under the jurisdiction of the Magicians from the National Defense Forces, even the Ten Master Clans could not raise a hand so easily.

Other than those areas, the mountain areas of the Hokuriku-San’in region is under the Ichijou Family, Tōhoku the Mutsuzuka Family, Hanshin-Chūgoku the Futatsugi Family, Shikoku the Itsuwa Family, the Kyushu area excluding Okinawa was under the Yatsushiro Family, and Kyōto—Nara-Shiga-Kii the Kudou Family. Furthermore, the Mitsuya Family actively provided the know-how to the Magicians of the Defense Forces and of the applications of the Third Research Laboratory, while cooperating with the other Houses of the “Three”.

The Saegusa Family as well as the Juumonji Family were in charge of the Kantō region, including Izu, while the Yotsuba Family is in charge of Tōkai as well as the Gifu-Nagano Prefectures.

“Saegusa-dono.”

“The Kantō region has had an increase in anti-Magician activities. It’s not at the level where interference is necessary, but I think sooner or later we will have to make a move. Also, there was some suspicious activity in Yokosuka. Perhaps they are planning sabotage.”

“Does Juumonji-dono share the same thoughts?”

“In regards to the anti-Magician movement, the Juumonji Family and I share the same opinion as Saegusa-dono. In regards to the saboteur, it is unfortunate, but we couldn’t catch him.”

“Hmm. Regarding the so-called Humanists, let’s discuss this later. Then, Yotsuba-dono.”

“While absent in Kantō, the Humanists have begun encroaching upon Tōkai. Now then, Saegusa-dono, Juumonji-dono.”

“Yotsuba-dono, what is it?”

Addressed by Maya, Kouichi answered with a smile. In that smile, elements other than sociability were slightly mixed in. The only time Kouichi would show a fluctuation of any emotion was when the other member of the conversation was Maya.

For Maya, she had never directed a gaze of concern towards Kouichi.

No matter what, she would always return a look that seemed to say whatever.

“There is suspicious activity in Izu. We propose tighter surveillance.”

Now was no exception. Glancing coldly and uninterestedly at Kouichi, the eye that seemed to ask why are you looking at me, then only gave a perfunctory reply.

“I understand. If you don’t mind, could you explain a little as to what kind of activity it was.”

The one who said so in a dignified voice was Katsuto. Though surrounded by seniors, he seemed to be indifferent to such a fact.

“I don’t mind. Last week, a small cargo ship that arrived at the Yokosuka Port via the North American route is currently anchored at the Numazu Port. We were observing that cruiser owned by the USNA Embassy. As of now, the embassy’s cruiser disappeared but, our surveillance of the cargo ship is still continued.

“Yotsuba-dono, do you know of the whereabouts of the cruiser?”

Kouichi posed another question towards Maya.

“I don’t know. Perhaps it is at sea.”

Though it seemed like Maya gave an irresponsible reply, originally it was supposed to be Kouichi that was responsible for investigating. The Juumonji Family is better suited for combat. so even though both were in charge of the Kanto-Izu region, the Saegusa Family was in charge of the investigation work.

“Very well, our family will investigate this issue. With the increase in anti-Magician activity… if that cargo ship has humanist passengers, then the USNA authorities might chase it as well. Numazu is Yotsuba-dono’s territory but, the issue is that ship entered the harbor of Yokosuka. Our family will continue to pursue this as well.”

Obviously understanding that, Kouichi summarized the situation flawlessly.

“Eh, I look forward to working with you.”

Nodding, Maya did not further discuss the topic of Heigu’s boat and Canopus’ cruiser.



As the regular reports concluded, the conference room’s atmosphere changed.

“Kudou-dono. Firstly, I have something I would like ask about this location.”

The remark which heralded trouble was made by Kouichi.

“Saegusa-dono, go ahead.”

With a sighing expression of patience, Makoto prompted Kouichi to go ahead.

“Very well, thank you for sparing me some time.”

Saying that, Kouichi faced Maya.

Once again, a certain mood drifted from Mutsuzuka Atsuko to Yatsushiro Raizou. Kouichi (with a gentlemanly attitude) turned to Maya, something that could be said to be a familiar sight in the Master Clans Conference.

“Yotsuba-dono, congratulations on your decision about your successor.”

“Thank you.”

Both Kouichi and Maya had fake smiles plastered on their faces.

Beneath the façade, Kouichi had a provocative glimmer in his eye, while Maya returned a cold gaze. No matter how one looked at it, both seemed ready to fight.

“But, regarding your son’s engagement issue, I’m afraid I cannot agree to that.”

“Why? If I remember correctly, personal issues like marriage have no necessity to seek approval from the Master Clans Conference. Am I wrong?”

Before any voices of approval could be interleaved, Maya rebutted Kouichi.

“Indeed if it was only a marriage, I wouldn’t be saying this. But when the possibility of ruining potential talent exists, it’s a different story.”

With the exception of Kouichi and Maya, everyone’s eyes focused on Ichijou Gouki.

Gouki’s mouth was twisted into a bent shape, with arms folded. His face seemed to voice his thoughts “In such a place and time…”

How does consanguineous marriage impact a Magician’s quality? Such research has not made much progress, and thus is a topic yet to be concluded. Some researchers have claimed it is harmful, while some have claimed it beneficial. But, above the fact that the risk of genetic abnormalities is assumed, it is considered that it is better that marriages with blood relationships too close be avoided. Actually among the Numbers, the law tends to discourage even marriage among cousins.

Kudou Makoto interlaced his fingers on the table, closing his eyes. From the side, he looked like he was deep in thought.

“It’s just an inclination, it is not forbidden. There are real examples too.”

The one who refuted Kouichi in a weary voice was not Maya.

“Eh. Just as Yatsushiro-dono said, even among the 28 Houses, there are sanguineous couples. But in that case, they have different mothers. Considering Yotsuba-dono’s current case, it cannot be discussed on an equal basis.”

“Even if they weren’t cousins, you can go back to the grandparents and find the father is related by being cousins with the other’s husband. Even when the blood relations are distant, the element of risk still exists in sanguineous marriage, doesn’t it?”

This time it was Mutsuzuka Atsuko who refuted Kouichi’s claim.

“The risk is never zero. The only question is to what degree, Mutsuzuka-dono.”

But, Atsuko’s remark could not cause Kouichi to falter.

“The reason I object to the Yotsuba Family’s Successors’ engagement, is that they are monozygotic twins, with very close blood ties. No different from a marriage between half-siblings. Is that not the case?”

Atsuko did not reply. Kouichi ignoring his emotional intention, his logic held persuasion.

“A marriage between cousins may be recognized by law. But if it becomes a marriage between half-siblings, then it could even be called a circumvention of the law.”

“Saegusa-dono, that is going too far.”

Futatsugi Mai gently restrained the extreme phrase, circumvention of the law. But, Mai didn’t seem to show any intention to oppose Kouichi’s claim.

“Apologies. I’ve indeed gone too far. Please forgive me, Yotsuba-dono.”

Maya ignored Kouichi’s apology.

“So in the end, what do you want to say Saegusa-dono?”

Ignoring everything, she cut straight to the point to seek what Kouichi’s request was.

Stopping even Kouichi’s smooth tongue, Kouichi’s face in the direction between Itsuwa Isami and Mutsuzuka Atsuko, staring at Maya.

“What I seek is very simple. I believe the successor to the Yotsuba Family, Shiba Miyuki-dono, and Shiba Tatsuya-dono’s engagement should be cancelled.”

Maya returned Kouichi’s stare.

Both Maya and Kouichi’s line of sight met.

Hidden beneath his light colored lenses, the emotion that crossed his remaining left eye was either joy or hatred.

“My apologies. May I add in something?”

The person who cut into the high tension between the two was Ichijou Gouki.

“Yotsuba-dono, though our family has yet to receive an answer from yours, I should admit that what Saegusa-dono has said was influenced by us. As such, could you please consider our request?”

“The issue regarding the request for the engagement between your family’s Masaki-dono and Miyuki?”

“Yes.”

Returning a face of fortitude, Maya languidly sighed deeply.

“Masaki-dono is the Ichijou Family’s successor is he not? Miyuki has also been confirmed as the successor of our family. Even if I put aside the fact that it is inappropriate of you to request an engagement when a prior one has been confirmed, what you speak of is impossible.”

Maya clearly sought to offend Gouki——or so was her guise——

Gouki replied in a chilly tone.

“I apologize for being rude. But we too are making a serious request. It is not a joke of any sort.”

“A serious request? To seek the hand of my niece who’s already engaged to someone, what part of that is a serious request?”

“My son genuinely hopes to tie the knot with Miyuki-dono. If you were to accept our proposal of marriage, then we intend to give Masaki to the Yotsuba Family.”

The round table was astir. Carrying the title of “Crimson Prince”, Ichijou Masaki demonstrated a degree of power that’s combat worthy of that title even at the age of 13, also during the 2095 Yokohama Incident, even now as a 17-year-old youth, his reputation as a first-class combat magician is well known throughout the Ten Master Clans.

For Gouki to say that it would be fine to let go of such an heir. No matter how one looked at it, the deal was very much favorable to the Yotsuba Family. Since there was no amount of deception in Gouki’s words, even Maya had to recognize the proposition.

“Is that so? But I still cannot accept your request.”

Although the discomfort disappeared from Maya’s expression, her attitude did not turn cold.

“…The reason, may I hear it?”

“For Ichijou-dono, as a parent, to hope to fulfill your child’s wishes, that is something I understand as well. But if Ichijou-dono has considered your child’s feelings, then as an aunt, I must also consider my niece’s feelings.”

“Miyuki-dono’s feelings?”

“Yes. My niece, Miyuki, likes my son Tatsuya. I believe that Tatsuya too cares for Miyuki. I wish to respect both their feelings.”

To Maya’s words, Futatsugi Mai and Mutsuzuka Atsuko both deeply nodded. Such words after all resonated more easily with the female gender.

“Are Miyuki’s feelings unmovable? Could you perhaps give Masaki a chance?”

“A Chance?”

“Miyuki-dono likely does not know much about Masaki yet.”

“Is that not the same for Masaki-dono? Aside from appearance, your son likely does not know much about Miyuki.”

Subtly saying “Masaki was only attracted to her looks” made Gouki feel very ashamed. Despite it being the truth, he was defiant.

“Thus, I hope you would give them a chance for them to become acquainted. If both of them get to know each other well, and still she refuses to choose Masaki, then we will give up.”

“Ichijou-dono… Are you aware that since earlier, your family has been rather disrespectful to both Miyuki and Tatsuya? Especially towards my son, Tatsuya. What Ichijou-dono is saying can only be interpreted as calling Tatsuya inferior as a man in comparison to Masaki-dono.”

Gouki was at a loss of words. He had no intention of saying so but, he may have spoken out as a doting parent.

Towards Maya’s harsh words, even Mai, who’s role as the stopper, did not say anything to chide her. This was to say that the majority of the Family Heads felt that Gouki should be accountable for what he said.

Then Kouichi who did not think so, once again dredged up his claims.

“However if one were to shelve their romantic feelings and look at it objectively, I think an engagement between Masaki-dono and Miyuki-dono would be a good match. More than anything, it would avoid any harm that could come from a sanguineous marriage.”

“Saegusa-dono… Are you saying that Miyuki-dono’s feelings are not worthy of consideration?”

Mitsuya Gen, who had been silent until then, reproved Kouichi in a bitter voice.

But Kouichi did not withdraw.

“Suppressing one’s emotions to a degree is necessary, especially as a successor to one of the Ten Master Clans. Is that not the case for everyone here?”

No voice of objection gave rise. What Kouichi said, everyone present knew.

“Also, Miyuki-dono is still young. If she were to get to know Masaki-dono, she may change her feelings.”

“Is that so… chemistry between a man and a woman, if they do not get to know each other, one will never know.”

The first voice who supported Kouichi, was Itsuwa Isami.

But the one who was most surprised at Isami’s words was most likely Kouichi. Though not apparent in his expression, Kouichi doubted Isami’s intent in his heart.

“I too thought it was a good pair, requesting for an engagement with Saegusa-dono’s daughter, but… Mayumi-dono and Hiroshi’s character didn’t mix well, and in the end it did not go anywhere.”

As Isami said, right before the Master Clans Conference, the Itsuwa Family broke off talks of marriage.

“Kouichi’s claim that an engagement between the Ichijou Family’s Masaki-dono and the Yotsuba Family’s Miyuki-dono is reasonable. Their marriage will bring more and more development to Japan’s Magic Community. Not to mention Ichijou-dono has said he is willing to give the Yotsuba Family Masaki-dono, I don’t think it’s such a bad deal to Yotsuba-dono.”

With Isami’s support, the winds began to change. In that instant, the tail wind was definitely blowing for Kouichi and Gouki.

But that wind was about to be broken in an instant.

“Itsuwa-dono. Our family does not consider or seek benefits from Miyuki’s marriage.”

Isami awkwardly looked down. Having realized his intention to induce discussion about short-term gain and loss, Maya flatly rejected him.

“I understand your stance; Miyuki is still young. I cannot say that the possibility of her feelings to change is zero. But that is as far as I can say, I think Masaki-dono should put in his own effort to move Miyuki’s heart. If Masaki were steal Miyuki away from Tatsuya, then even I wouldn’t tie up Miyuki. To the Yotsuba Family, we will serve any command from Miyuki, but we may yield regarding the seat of the son-in-law.”

“So the engagement is not annulled?”

“In exchange, you would not mind if Masaki-dono were to go after Miyuki-dono?”





Makoto and Mai confirmed Maya’s meaning.

“That interpretation is fine. In the first place, dare I say, that Miyuki and Tatsuya’s marriage is a legitimate thing recognized by the law. It’s not anything that must result in accepting any objection by the law, is it?”

To Maya’s words, Mai nodded.

“It is certainly as Yotsuba-dono said. Sanguineous marriage does indeed carry some risk. That said, Saegusa-dono’s claim exceeds the scope of decisions that can be made in the Master Clans Conference.”

Mai then moved her gaze from Kouichi to Gouki.

“Ichijou-dono, is that fine? Yotsuba-dono has said that despite Miyuki-dono’s engagement, she will allow your son to interact with Miyuki-dono. The parents will not interfere with anything beyond that.”

“…I understand. I will convey that to my son.”

“I too, am fine with that.”

Both Gouki and Kouichi decided to lay down arms.

“By the way, the allowing of one to date while they have a fiancée also apply to Tatsuya-dono?”

Of course, Kouichi was not of the type that would raise the white flag without conditions.

Under the gaze of Maya and Mai, Kouichi made a smile.

“As Itsuwa-dono has said earlier, the talks for the engagement between Itsuwa Family’s Hirofumi and our Mayumi have broken down. If it goes well, I was hoping for Mayumi to marry Tatsuya-dono.”

Kudou Retsu had been once referred to as a “Trickster” due to his magic, but perhaps in terms of personality, Kouichi possessed similar traits.



As everyone was tired from the miasma thrown by Kouichi, the Master Clans Conference had a break.

Then ten minutes later, this time it was Maya who began with a bombshell.

Not an iffy thing like Kouichi’s claim, but a big scandal.

“Everyone, I have something I would like to say.”

“Oh. An issue raised by Yotsuba-dono is indeed rare. What would it be about.”

Encouraged by Makoto, Maya smiled at Kouichi.

A shudder ran down the spines of the rest of the Ten Master Clans Heads’. The extent of their antagonism was such that even Katsuto who had yet to see it felt the same.

Maya slowly opened her glossy red lips.

“Has everyone heard of a man that goes by the name of Zhou Gongjin?”

The moment Maya said that, Makoto’s body stiffened. Though Kouichi did not show any reaction but non-reaction was the same as saying that he indeed had knowledge about the subject.

“Zhou Gongjin…?”

“Yotsuba-dono, isn’t that the famous Zhou Yu of Wu from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms?”

Maya shook her head while smiling in response to Mutsuzuka Atsuko and Yatsushiro Raizou’s questions.

“Basing his headquarters in Yokohama’s Chinatown, he’s an Ancient Magician born on the continent. Taoists, I believe they were called, correct, Kudou-dono?”

“A, aah. Ancient Magicians from the continent are often called as such.”

Makoto used all his strength to suppress his body from trembling.

“Kudou-dono, what happened? You seem to have a bad complexion.”

“No, it’s nothing, Mutsuzuka-dono.”

After tilting her head at the suspicious attitude of Makoto, she turned back to Maya’s direction.

“So, what about this Zhou Gongjin?”

“Anti-Magic International Political Organization ‘Blanche’. Hong Kong based International Crime Syndicate ‘No-Head Dragon’. The sabotage forces of the Great Asian Alliance that caused the Yokohama Incident. And then the incident that took place in the heart of Tokyo, the Vampire Incident which took the world by storm: ‘Parasites’. He is the man who helped orchestrate all of this, the mastermind that brought chaos to our country, or should I say, the mastermind designated to cause trouble in Japan.”

The conference room had a bustling atmosphere.

It wasn’t that there was an increase in chatter, there were barely ten people in the room. It was not a topic one could freely discuss with those next to them.

But even so, the shock that took away the calm and composed attitudes of the Heads of the Ten Master Clans stemmed from Maya’s short speech.

“Yotsuba-dono.”

Facing Maya, Raizou softly raised his hand. It seemed to be an unintentional habit from university.

“Just now you used the word ‘designated’ in past tense, which is to say he has already been disposed of? Or that he has fled the country?”

“Assisted by Ichijou Masaki-dono, and Kudou Minoru-dono, Zhou Gongjin was killed by Tatsuya last October.”

Makoto expressed a feeling of surprise. He had heard the report from Masaki but he didn’t hear from Minoru.

However, the change in his facial expression was not noticed by the other Heads. This was because all eyes were concentrated on Maya, excluding Kouichi, Gouki and Makoto, the Heads were nodding in admiration.

“Minoru-dono, which is to say, Kudou-dono’s youngest son?”

Makoto barely faked a smile while nodding to Raizou’s question.

“The Ichijou Family’s Masaki-dono, the Yotsuba Family’s Tatsuya-dono, and the Kudou Family’s Minoru-dono… how reliable.”

Mitsuya Gen broadly complimented.

“That’s right. It really brings me joy to hear the next generation is growing up so splendidly. I can believe that the future of Japan’s Magic Community is secure.”

Futatsugi Mai accompanied.

“Both Juumonji-dono and I feel that, even though they will only be juniors in the next generation, they are indeed reliable.”

Mutsuzuka Atsuko’s words invited laughter from the seniors.

However the peaceful atmosphere was shattered by Maya’s next words.

“Saegusa-dono. Were you in collusion with Zhou Gongjin?”

The round table returned to silence.

“…Yotsuba-dono, does that claim have a legitimate basis?”

Itsuwa Isami squeezed out in a hoarse voice.

Kouichi remained silent.

“Saegusa-dono. You used your subordinate, Nakura Saburou, to establish contact with Zhou Gongjin, indirectly using Civil Rights Party’s Congressman Kanda to instigate the anti-Magician movement. Do you have any objections?”

Kouichi slowly opened his mouth.

“Yotsuba-dono, I too, would like to hear the basis of this.”

Kouichi and Maya coldly glared at each other.

“If I may speak.”

In that tense moment, it was the youngest, Katsuto, who spoke up.

In spite of the gazes focused on him, Katsuto began his testimony in a calm tone.

“The fact that Saegusa-dono instigated the anti-Magician movement is the truth. I heard it from Saegusa-dono himself.”

All the gazes on Katsuto, shifted to Kouichi.

“Saegusa-dono, do you have any excuses?”

Atsuko sharply cross-examined Kouichi.

Kouichi had a smile that had a feeling of complacency and calmness.

“What Juumonji-dono said is true. What Yotsuba-dono said is somewhat true as well. Just that the order is somewhat mistaken.”

“The order? What do you mean?”

Gouki spat out. But Kouichi’s smile did not falter.

“My subordinate established contact with Zhou Gongjin, only after the anti-Magician movement was more stable after First High’s Stellar Furnace Experiment. Aah, now that we’re on this topic, that too was the achievement of Yotsuba Family’s Tatsuya-dono. That experiment was highly evaluated by Rozen’s Branch, and radically changed the winds. What a spectacular son.”

“So, what about it?”

Gouki irritatedly rebuked Kouichi.

Kouichi did not delay the conversation any longer, or do anything that could irritate Gouki.

“When I established contact with Zhou Gongjin, it was to stop the Mass Media’s attempts to target Magicians as a whole. Of course, I had to give something in return, something that would be disadvantageous to Japan’s Magic Community.”

“Aa, you’re right. You joined hands with Zhou Gongjin after the instigation of the anti-Magician movement.”

Maya frankly admitted Kouichi’s claim.

“But the fact that Zhou Gongjin caused so much harm to our country is an indisputable fact. To collaborate with someone like that, is very inappropriate for someone from the Ten Master Clans. Everyone, is that not the case?”

The reason Maya wasn’t overly respectful with her words was due to this.

“Certainly.”

Ichijou Gouki expressed his consent briefly.

“It is as Yotsuba-dono said.”

Mutsuzuka Atsuko, “Unfortunately, it is as she said.”

Yatsushiro Raizou, “Saegusa-dono, at the time, I too said that it would have been better for you to stop.”

Juumonji Katsuto, “Saegusa-dono may have had his own ideas but…”

Itsuwa Isami, “I cannot defend Saegusa-dono.”

Mitsuya Gen, “Saegusa-dono. No matter what your intents were, you crossed a line you should never cross, and collaborated with someone you never should have.”

Futatsugi Mai, everyone supported Maya.

Kouichi, who was still smiling, was now cornered.

Gouki, Atsuko, Raizou, Katsuto, Isami, Gen, Mai’s eyes, all pointed in Kudou Makoto’s direction, who had yet to express his opinion.

But what Mai said to Kouichi at the end applied to Makoto as well.

Though it could be said that his circumstances were different from Kouichi, he too had been in collusion with Zhou Gongjin.

Makoto’s worries were interrupted by a knock on the door.

“Would you mind if I enter?”

The voice that likely came from the other side of the door was from an old man that all the members knew very well.





Sitting closest to the door, Katsuto stood up and looked at the rest.

Though there were others who agreed, no one was shaking their head.

Katsuto walked to the doorway, and opened the door.

Standing behind the door was the retired Kudou Retsu.

“Sensei, I haven’t seen you in a long time. Even so, what business do you have today?”

Mai invited Retsu in cordially. Katsuto tried to offer his seat but, Retsu smiled and waved his hand.

“Apologies but, I overheard the topic at hand.”

Retsu immediately cut to the chase.

Though there was nobody who would call it into question, it was a rule that the topics of discussion during the Conference were to remain absolutely confidential. The Kudou Family wasn’t the first to use methods to leak the general basis of the conference.

“For everyone to hold Kouichi accountable is obvious. But, I would like for that to be put on hold.”

Retsu referred to Kouichi not as “Saegusa-dono” but by his first name.

By doing so, he made it clear that his intent was not to speak as a former member of the Master Clans Conference but as the Patriarch of Japan’s Magic Community——the speech of an old man who held no authority.

“Instigating the anti-Magician movement was something I too discussed with Kouichi. And I did not stop Kouichi.”

Glances were exchanged in a flurry across the round table. Excluding Maya, Kouichi and Makoto; Gouki, Mai, Gen, Isami, Atsuko, Raizou, and Katsuto were all contemplating Retsu’s real intentions. Makoto wasn’t even aware of his father’s intentions. The only people who had guessed Retsu’s motive were Maya and Kouichi.

“Also, if you’re talking about relations with Zhou Gongjin, then the Kudou Family is not innocent either. Although we did discuss this plan, we hadn’t take any concrete actions. I took the magic provided by Zhou Gongjin to use Parasites as non-human magical weapons, with innocent young people as guinea pigs. If Maya’s son did not stop it, then something irreversible might have occurred.”

As Retsu faced Maya, she nodded and faintly smiled. She had intended to strike Kouichi firmly, but she wasn’t driven by that goal. If Retsu wanted to cover for Kouichi, she had no intention of ruining the student-teacher relationship.

“If you compare the actions we took, Kouichi’s do not exceed mine in severity.”

“But Sensei.”

Retsu turned towards Gouki’s direction and signaled for him to stop speaking.

“The Kudou Family shall retire from the Ten Master Clans. With that, could you consider this case concluded?”

“Senior…”

Makoto looked up at his father with a shocked expression.

As Retsu made his suggestion, he directed a harsh glance towards his son.

“Makoto, you are guilty of directly accommodating Zhou Gongjin. The incident caused by the Taoists sent by Zhou Gongjin has greatly inconvenienced Yotsuba-dono’s son, and Ichijou-dono’s son. For this kind of outcome, you should be speaking up, not me.”

“Senior… Father!”

“Makoto, I’m disappointed in you.”

“Sensei, would that be okay with you?”

The one who soothed Retsu was Maya.

“If the Kudou Family takes full responsibility for this, then the Yotsuba Family shall consent. It would be fine if Saegusa-dono makes amends with future contributions.”

Retsu did not cover for Kouichi just because of their teacher and student relationship. Makoto, his son, would hold higher priority in that case.

Currently, the magic group with the most power in Japan isn’t the Nation Defense Force, but actually the Yotsuba Family followed closely by the Saegusa Family. These two Families are the two greatest authorities in the Japanese Magic Community. If the Saegusa Family was to be excluded from the Ten Master Clans, it would be a very undesirable outcome. For the sake of maintaining order, they must remain a part of the Ten Master Clans.

To ensure the Ten Master Clans that he created would survive, Retsu covered for Kouichi. Maya seeing through his intentions wasn’t difficult.

“If Yotsuba-dono says so…”

“It’s certainly true that if the Saegusa Family were to be removed from the Ten Master Clans, the hole left behind would be too great.”

Atsuko and Raizou agreed with Maya successively. Yet Kouichi’s only eye still remind cold.

There were no voices of objection.

Kouichi looked at the circumstances with a poker face that lacked a smile.

Maya faced such a Kouichi and gave a smile.

“Makoto, let’s go.”

Ordered by Retsu, Makoto stood up tardily from the Ten Master Clans seat.

“Everyone, excuse us.”

Retsu lightly nodded and left the meeting room.

Makoto followed behind with drooping shoulders.



The door shut with a pattern sound.

“Very well then.”

As the stopped time began moving, Itsuwa Isami started with a harried voice.

“We must decide on a family to replace the Kudou Family.”

“Tomorrow is the Selection Meeting. Why not do it then?”

Mitsuya Gen objected, “In the event where a vacancy occurs in the Ten Master Clans, a replacement member will be chosen to fill in that role. Even if it would only be a day, the Ten Master Clans should not be in a state where it’s missing any members.”

In replacement of Makoto, Futatsugi Mai supported Isami’s suggestion as the next eldest.

“Is that so. Who would be a good choice? Any candidates?”

Gouki questioned with a helpless expression.

“Then.”

As Maya said that, all eyes were on her.

“How about Shippou-dono? The Head, Takumi-dono is wise, though they have few disciples, they have considerable economic strength.”

Gouki, Katsuto and Isami glanced at Kouichi’s face. Though it was well known by the others that the Saegusa Family and the Shippou Family had a bone to pick, Kouichi showed no sign of any reaction.

“Shippou-dono… Any other recommendations?”

There were no Heads who answered Mai’s question.

“Very well, the new member of the Ten Master Clans is decided to be Shippou-dono. Though it will only be for a day but, who shall convey it to Shippou-dono?”

“Very well, I shall do so.”

Katsuto raised his hand, and exited the conference room to make the call.

“Wait a moment, Juumonji-dono.”

Mai voiced out when his back was to her.

“We shall be taking a break for a while. How about resuming in 30 minutes?”

There was no objection to Mai’s words.




The next day, February 5th.

Right after entering Class 2-E, Tatsuya was visited by Shippou Takuma.

“Shippou, is something wrong?”

Faster than Tatsuya could ask, a voice filled with curiosity greeted Takuma, and the owner of said voice was the Club Activities’ senior, Tomitsuka.

“No, it’s just… I wanted to express my gratitude to Shiba-senpai.”

Takuma uncomfortably replied so.

Well, such feelings of discomfort were perfectly understandable. It was a well-known fact that Takuma had caused quite the commotion back in April with his series of duels.

His recent change of attitude was unanimously acknowledged by not only the freshmen, but even the upperclassmen. Even so, his rudeness to Tatsuya was still fresh in their memory. This was made evident by the numerous inquisitive looks that people gave him whenever he talked to Tatsuya.

In addition to this, Erika and Leo also gave him gazes of ill will.

Although Mikihiko had come to Class 2-E today, his look bore the same unfavorable feelings as Erika’s and Leo’s.

“Gratitude? I don’t remember doing anything worth being thanked for?”

What saved Takuma was that Tatsuya apparently didn’t hold a grudge at all. It was quite the opposite in fact, having seen Takuma’s efforts during the Nine Schools Competition, he now had a better opinion of him.

“Umm… I heard that Yotsuba-dono recommended my family as a replacement for one of the Ten Master Clans…”

“My apologies, but this is the first I’ve heard of it.”

Tatsuya wasn’t pretending, he genuinely wasn’t aware of it. To begin with, the fact that a “replacement” was needed meant that one of the current Ten Master Clans had stepped down from their seat. Just what kind of incident had occurred? Tatsuya couldn’t help but wonder.

“Even if it’s just as a replacement until a proper selection is made today… I’m still extremely grateful. Thank you very much!”

It had probably been extremely embarrassing for him, after immediately finishing his sentence, Takuma went back to his own classroom at full speed.

Tatsuya was vaguely aware of the fact that Takuma was sensitive about everything related to the Ten Master Clans.

However, to think that it brought him such a level of happiness…

Tatsuya was reminded once again of the fact that every person had a different sense of values, and of what was important.




Today was the day of the Ten Master Clans Selection Meeting, an event that only took place once every 4 years. Along with the Ten Master Clans, the respective Heads of the 18 Assistant Houses could be seen.

Aside from the Kudou Family, everyone was present.

“Well then, the Ten Master Clans Selection Meeting can begin.”

Following Futatsugi Mai’s declaration, all the members stood up.

“First of all, as per the tradition, if anyone present here has an objection or feels dissatisfaction at the current line-up of Members of the Ten Master Clans, please remain standing. If you don’t have any, sit down within the next minute.”

The primary voting is a peculiar tradition of the Selection Meeting. Even if only one person remained standing, then papers would be distributed and the ballot would move on to the actual voting. The vote would decide who would become the 10 Houses that would be the most suitable to hold the title of Ten Master Clans, and the counting would be done under the supervision of 3 Members of the current Ten Master Clans as well as 3 Members of the 18 Assistant Houses for a total of 6 Members.

However, this would be a “signed vote”. The criteria for choosing the next Ten Master Clans would be the power carried by each House at this point in time. However, “Magical Power” wouldn’t be the only factor in this, for the ability to support the Nation would also be required.

Even if you were to vote for an unsuitable House, you wouldn’t lose your Number. However, the following 4 years would have your House bear the penalty, or rather, stigma of not having discerning eyes.

Following Mai’s instructions, the first 10 Members around the table returned to their seat.

The current Heads of the 18 Assistant Houses also started to sit one by one.

When the second hand of the clock had done a 180°, the unexpected happened.

The Heads of the Kuki Family and the Kuzumi Family sat down.

Those two had been expected to vote for the now dismissed Kudou Family’s inclusion in the new Ten Master Clans, so this action struck a blow to the other members of the 18 Assistant Houses who hadn’t foreseen this turn of events.

The members who were still standing up looked at each other.

One by one, people sat down as if stopped dead in their tracks.

When 50 seconds had elapsed, there was no one left standing.

When the one-minute mark was reached, Mai stood up once again.

“Then, for the next 4 years, the Ichijou Family, Futatsugi Family, Mitsuya Family, Yotsuba Family, Itsuwa Family, Mutsuzuka Family, Saegusa Family, Shippou Family, Yatsushiro Family and the Juumonji Family will be known as the Ten Master Clans. Everyone, I expect your continued cooperation.”

The other nine members of the table stood up, and following Mai’s words, bowed.

The 18 Assistant Houses who were surrounding the new Ten Master Clans joined in a round of applause.



Once the selection of the new Ten Master Clan ended, it was part of tradition that the 18 Assistant Houses leave to allow the Ten Master Clans to discuss about their new organization and structure. However, when the Heads of the Kuki, and Kuzumi Families tried to leave, Mai called them to a stop.

“Kuki-dono, Kuzumi-dono, please wait for a moment.”

“Futatsugi-dono?”

“Is something the matter?”

“There is something I would like to ask of you two. Would you mind giving me a little bit of your time?”

The Heads of the Kuki and Kuzumi Families nodded. When the other Members of the 18 Assistant Houses finished retiring, only the Ten Master Clans’ remained, as well as two families bearing the Number “Nine”, for a total of 12 names.

“What did you want to ask of us?”

“Futatsugi-dono, allow me to take it from here.”

The one who stopped Mai had been Shippou Takumi, the newest member of the Ten Master Clans.

“Kuki-dono, Kuzumi-dono. Even though my family was bestowed the honor of being part of the Ten Master Clans, quite frankly, we don’t have the numbers that would be required to fulfill our duties. Normally we would have to take the supervision of the Kyoto area in Kudou-dono’s stead, but this is too big a duty for my family in its current state.”

“In that case, why don’t you ask for Yotsuba-dono or Futatsugi-dono’s help? If Kyoto is a problem, then Ichijou-dono also has responsibilities towards this area.”

Takumi shook his head with a smile at the proposal by the Head of the Kuki Family.

“That is also an idea. However, I want the Kudou Family to continue to watch over the Kyoto-Shiga and the Kii Peninsula. Of course, the Shippou Family doesn’t plan on only making demands. I would like every one of the ‘Nine’ to lend my family their strength.”

After a moment of wide-eyed surprise, the Heads of the Kuki and Kuzumi Families smiled broadly.

“Understood.”

“I will consult about this matter with Makoto-sama, we will definitely have a positive answer.”

“I’m counting on you.”

Takumi bowed deeply, the Heads of both the Kuki and the Kuzumi Families also bowed politely.



After their departure, a somewhat relaxed mood drifted in the conference room.

“Well then, let’s continue the Master Clans Conference.”

“A counter-plan to the Humanist ideology right?”

Mai’s words invited this question.

“No, before that we have to talk about this suspicious ship spotted near Izu.”

The one who had interrupted was Gouki.

“Ichijou-dono… There’s no hurry now is there?”

Although Isami reproved him with a shocked expression,

“If it is a terrorist ship, I can’t imagine the other side will keep waiting.”

Gouki didn’t yield.

“I don’t mind, Itsuwa-dono.”

The one who answered with this was Kouichi, who had regained his usual composure overnight.

“Then let’s hear more about this matter.”

Although Kouichi’s attitude was the same as ever, it appeared that Gouki didn’t want to associate with him anymore. For someone like Gouki, secret communication with the enemy was an inexcusable act.

“There was no reaction when searching for a Magician on the freighter Yotsuba-dono gave us coordinates for. Neither weapons nor ammunition were found on board.”

“Did you find anything?”

“There is a possibility that explosives were being transported. Since it’s also possible that the ship will be used for escape purposes, we plan on keeping it under observation.”

“How about the USNA’s movements?”

Taking Gouki’s momentum, this time it was Katsuto’s turn to question Kouichi.

“An agent has been dispatched. In other words, the group that has betrayed the USNA has been found out, but they’re not being that tactful about things. It’s quite possible that this duty wasn’t an order from the USNA Government itself.”

“In other words, a favorite hunter of theirs is on the prowl, hiding somewhere?”

“The cruiser that Yotsuba-dono received information on was confirmed as outside of territorial waters. He could unexpectedly be hiding out there.”

Hearing Kouichi’s answer, Isami wore a pensive expression.

“If it’s at sea, should I go and poke around? It should be possible to camouflage it into an accident using the natural disaster excuse.”

“The problem isn’t so much the hunter from the USNA, but the terrorists that have infiltrated our country.”

At Isami’s proposal, Atsuko brought forth a diametrically opposite opinion.

“That is certainly the case. We have no evidence of their presence at the moment, but we also don’t have any evidence of their absence. It’s really worrying that we don’t even know if they’re lurking about.”

Raizou was supporting Atsuko’s argument.

“They might even be targeting this very Master Clans Conference for all we know.”

This must have been a pure coincidence.

However, it was the truth.

Immediately after Raizou had said this, an overpowering sound accompanied by powerful vibrations invaded the conference room.




February 5th, 2097 A.D., 10:33 A.M.

It was currently break time between second and third period at First High.

A buzzing sound came from Tatsuya’s pocket as he was heading towards the Practice Room, it was an emergency signal.

Taking out his terminal and confirming the contents, you could read on his face that something terrible had just happened.

“Sorry, go on ahead without me!”

Tatsuya left his classmates, among which was Mizuki, and dashed towards the Practice Room.

Tatsuya, who had received his teacher Jennifer Smith’s blessing to leave early, met Miyuki on the way towards the main gate.

“Onii-sama also received the emergency signal?”

Miyuki, whose face had lost all trace of color, asked Tatsuya with a short sentence.

“Let’s go.”

Tatsuya answered with an even shorter sentence.

Although Miyuki had nodded and was about to hasten her pace, a voice called her from the behind.

Minami came out of the entrance, accompanied by her classmate Saegusa Kasumi, as well as her sister Izumi and last but not least, Shippou Takuma. All of them were related to the Ten Master Clans. All of them, with the exception of Minami, were blood-related to the Ten Master Clans.

“Miyuki-senpai.”

Izumi ran towards Miyuki.

“Izumi-chan, too.”

“So it wasn’t a false alarm then!”

Miyuki nodded to her question.

Izumi started to tremble uncontrollably.

“We’re going to see what happened for ourselves. What about all of you.”

Tatsuya, who was just a step away, asked the freshmen.

“I’m coming too.”

Takuma immediately answered so.

“We’re going as well.”

Kasumi grasped her trembling sister’s hand.

Minami came closer to Miyuki. So that she could shield her at a moment’s notice.

Leading the group, Tatsuya and the five other people hastened towards the station.




During the same time, at Third High.

“Masaki, what happened!”

Masaki had dashed out of the classroom after having asked permission to leave early. Kichijouji, who had run after him until he was out of breath, asked such.

“My old man has been attacked.”

Regretting even the time spent looking back, Masaki answered.

“An attack? But… Right about now it should still be in the middle of the Master Clans Conf…”

“I’m saying that the Master Clans Conference was the victim of a terrorist attack.”

“What did you say!”

Seeing Kichijouji at a loss for words, Masaki turned around.

“I can’t be sure about what exactly happened from the emergency signal alone. I only know that he’s still alive. I’m heading there by helicopter. I’m counting on you to watch over Akane and the others.”

“A-alright, I get it! Be careful, Masaki.”

“Yeah, I know.”

Masaki wasn’t heading home, he was heading towards the company heliport.




Simultaneously, at the Magic University.

“Saegusa-san, something the matter.”

During a lesson that was in the form of a debate, the female teacher called out to Mayumi.

“My apologies, Sensei. Could I borrow your ear for a moment.”

With a dark expression floating on her face, Mayumi walked with quick—steps towards the teacher’s desk.

She discreetly showed the teacher her terminal which was still displaying the emergency signal.

Just as the teacher was about to raise her voice, she managed to keep it under control with a gesture, she then brought her ear close.

“I recall the people in my family were rather anxious. My older brothers might even attempt to go on-site, I would like to go back home and try to have everyone settle down.”

The teacher nodded with a serious look.

Not letting her classmates feel any ambiguity, Mayumi announced with a smile and a slightly apologetic expression that she had to leave for familial business.




The explosion had occurred right behind the conference room’s doors, crimson flames licked the walls.

However, those flames were extinguished at once.

“Juumonji-dono, exemplary.”

Not a single member of the Master Clans Conference had a bruise. Both the heat and the impact were completely hampered by Katsuto’s heatproof shield.

“Mutsuzuka-dono as well, as expected.”

The erasure of the flames was caused by Mutsuzuka Atsuko’s Heat Manipulation. For the Magicians of the “Six”, putting out a flame that couldn’t even melt steel was child’s play.

“We should probably head towards the exit. If we get buried alive, it’ll be too much of a bother to escape.”

While Futatsugi Mai was prohibiting the oxidation of the structure from the heat so there would be no spreading of poisonous fumes, she made that comment with a composed voice.

“Agreed. It seems like a considerably large-scale suicide-bombing operation has begun.”

While Mitsuya Gen had several magics’ on standby, he nodded to Mai’s words.

“Puppet terrorists! Such a terrible thing they’ve done.”

Gouki clicked his tongue intensely upon seeing the suicide bombing continue. Puppet terrorism was basically suicide bombing using humans as puppets to perform the act. Using Magic or drugs to make human dolls out of human beings, there were also ways to deprive someone of self-control with magic.

What Gouki sensed was the latter, a magic that controlled the flesh. He felt slow-moving presences in the first floor’s lobby, as well as the corridors of every floor, it seemed to be going downward.

Although the Ichijou family and the Magicians of the “One” were skilled in Magic that interfered with the flesh and body, magic that manipulates the movement of the body has always been forbidden. There have been examples of “losing one’s number” for those who ignored that law. That is why even if Gouki understood what exactly was happening, he didn’t know how to stop this wicked thing known as Puppet Terrorism.

“This is bad.”

Sensing that the floor was about to collapse, Yatsushiro Raizou executed Gravity-Control Magic. It wasn’t comparable to the one used for Flight Magic, and lifting an area of this size which lost all support required tremendous effort.

“Let’s make haste.”

Everyone nodded to Kouichi’s words, Maya, Mai and Atsuko left the room, the ten Magicians aimed for the outside as a group.



Aiming at the bombers who were roaming around in the corridors,

Ichijou Gouki unleashed “Rupture”.

“They aren’t suicide bombers. They’re just manipulated corpses carrying bombs.”

The flow of insults that Gouki, who had just blown off a corpse’s arm to obstruct the detonation procedure, was spitting in an angry voice, surpassing the others’ expectations.

To prevent getting buried due to the crumbling floor, the leaders of the Ten Master Clans decided to go to the rooftop and jump off from there while disposing of the occasional corpse bomber they encountered.

It was Mitsuya Gen and Saegusa Kouichi who were the fastest in taking action towards the bombers. There was a technique that originally allowed one to perform up to a maximum of nine different Magic Sequences at the same time, then store them to allow a simultaneous, instantaneous release of all of them. “Speed-Loader”, using Kouichi’s “Octet” allowed him to maintain 8 different Magics from 4 different Systems on standby and select which Magic he needed to deal with a wide variety of situations instantly. The walking corpses could not even hope to approach them.

The odd time an explosion couldn’t be prevented, the multi-layered defensive wall “Phalanx” was the perfect tool.

Raizou’s Gravity-Control Magic was there to prevent the ground from suddenly falling under their feet.

Atsuko’s Heat Manipulation Magic could erase any fire.

Futatsugi Mai would remove the poisonous fumes, Maya was acting as a flashlight in those lightless corridors once the flames were put out.

Itsuwa Isami and Shippou Takumi didn’t have a chance to do anything.

It was impossible for those bomb-carrying corpses to kill or even wound any of them.

The Family Heads had already noticed this fact.

“It’s going to be tough finding a countermeasure to the Media.”

Gen complained all the while making Swiss cheese out of the corpses.

“I guess we have no way of deceiving them at all.”

While putting out a wall of flames, Atsuko made a comment with a tone of resignation.

“Although we managed to get a photograph of the fact that it was corpses who were holding the bombs… I think revealing this to the public would have quite the negative effect.”

Isami, who had given up on any hope of getting a turn at doing anything, he agreed while taking photos.

“Still, I doubt purposely injuring ourselves would help much, if at all.”

Hearing Maya’s point, Raizou shrugged his shoulders.

“Shall we hide until the flames of their fury cool down.”

Raizou’s comment which might have been either a joke or a serious statement, no voice of objection came.




February 5th, 2097 A.D., 10:30 A.M.

The number of victims of the Hakone XXXX Hotel’s terror bombings came out to be 22, and it became a disaster with as many as 34 casualties.

Furthermore, the number of uninjured people was 33. The number of Magicians among them was 27.

The harshest criticism came from the public opinions of those who claimed that the Magicians had prioritized their own well-being above that of others.

Afterword




Have you enjoyed, “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” Volume 17 “Master Clans Conference Arc” <Part 1>? This time around action wasn’t a factor, instead I tried to introduce plenty of love-hate components. (Lie) Not all of the men and woman are pessimistic about the establishment of the Class One couple. I think the majority is rather “glad” and would congratulate the two of them, and those who are on the side of “They are stuck together willfully” will think that it’s common. As for the couple themselves, if people think about them living as an established couple later on, it would probably be best to have them give their blessings.

But due to people being friends, acquaintances, and perhaps something that should be expected from a rival’s grief, it isn’t rare for “lover” relationships to be formed. They’re certainly present within today’s world. Surely the majority lies in this direction for fictional worlds.

However, speaking of established couples who were urged by their parents… How’s this: I think the author himself should become engaged before they officially become a couple. Well with the case (Refrained due to Spoilers), the person himself might be thankful since he has a clear mind to do as such. There are tons of late-bloomers though.

But I think (Refrained to due Spoilers) is an extreme nuisance. One’s true feelings get set aside.

Although it was slightly different from the previous illustrations, Lina had appeared in the storyline for around one year now. She is an easy character to write so I really want to include her a lot more… as of now, she has yet to depart from America. Even though she’s appeared on stage for a while, perhaps it will take form this time. Too bad.

Well, the next book will be “Master Clans Conference (II)”. This section will be made up of three parts just like the “Visitors Arc”. The content will be similar to that of the “Visitors Arc”. You might say that the games “Out of Order” and “Lost Zero” are similar.

…Since I won’t try to “not spoil anything anymore”, please look forward to enjoying the next book “Master Clans Conference Arc (II)”.

Notes




Boku (僕): Is a masculine form of 私 (watashi). It is mostly used by males, especially those in their youth, but tomboys are known to use the word as well.

RFID: RFID stands for Radio-Frequency IDentification. The acronym refers to small electronic devices that consist of a small chip and an antenna. The chip typically is capable of carrying 2,000 bytes of data or less.

The RFID device serves the same purpose as a bar code or a magnetic strip on the back of a credit card or ATM card; it provides a unique identifier for that object. And, just as a bar code or magnetic strip must be scanned to get the information, the RFID device must be scanned to retrieve the identifying information.
