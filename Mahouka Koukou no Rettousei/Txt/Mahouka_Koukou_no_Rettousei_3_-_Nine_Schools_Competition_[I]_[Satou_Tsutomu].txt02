Right now, she was in the middle of the three minute break where the players would usually towel off the sweat or grab a drink of water.

Unfortunately, her bag containing her towel and water was next to Tatsuya.

Walking off the court was the same as actively moving towards where Tatsuya was waiting — where he lay in ambush.

Mayumi was a little scared of leaving the court.

That being said, she couldn’t stay on the court either. Even though she hadn’t moved a muscle during the earlier session, she should definitely take the opportunity to take a break right now. Not only that, she needed to replenish lost moisture and head towards the next court.

She wouldn’t have cared if she shocked the Operations Committee Members, but with her position, she couldn’t afford to worry the students that came to cheer her on.

Mayumi took a deep breath and expelled all her unease and worry.

(Forget it, women need to be courageous!)

Mayumi ordered her feet to start walking.

“Good work.”

At her underclassman handing her a towel, Mayumi felt a sense of disappointment as that nameless dread seemed to fade away like a dream.

As usual, any thoughts he had beneath that serious visage were completely obscured by the poker face that even she couldn’t read. This young man gave her a formless and unidentifiable sense of dread, but at the same time provided a miraculous sense of relief that he would never betray her.

Her earlier comment about “having a younger brother” was something spontaneous or intended to tease Tatsuya. While phrased as a joke, on some level it reflected Mayumi’s real thoughts.

Mayumi came to the conclusion that being afraid of him was ridiculous, so she adopted an obstinate attitude.

“Don’t say good work yet, the contest hasn’t ended, so this isn’t the time to relax.”

Tatsuya was on the representative team, but he wasn’t a participant himself.

He was only on duty before and after the contests and was merely a bystander during the events, so telling him “this isn’t the time to relax” was very odd, but Tatsuya made no mention of it despite noticing this.

“No, it’s over.”

He was pointing towards a more practical matter.

“Ah?”

“The opposing participant is unable to continue and, even if she were going to enter the second session, would definitely keel over from exhaustion in the middle. The auxiliaries from the other side are also aware of this, so this round will conclude with their surrender.”

Mayumi turned around to find the opposing team’s tactical advisors discussing with the panel of judges about this exact topic.

The participant was sprawled on top of a long chair while covered in medical detection equipment.

“Psion exhaustion due to continuous magic invocation. Most likely a mistaken assignment. She was a little lacking to be your opponent, President.”

“……You understood that much just from seeing that?”

“So long as I can ‘see clearly’.”

There was no way the panel of judges could hear Tatsuya speak, but the moment he finished speaking, the panel announced that Mayumi’s opponent had withdrawn.

Dazed, Mayumi stood stock still without budging, an extremely rare side of her that would normally prompt a laugh. Yet, Tatsuya did not smile, and merely urged Mayumi to start moving.

“Let’s return to the pavilion. It’s best to review your CAD and prepare for the next round.”

“Yeah, you’re right, I’ll leave that to you.”

Right now, Tatsuya was completely in control of the situation, but Mayumi didn’t make any pointless resistance as she followed Tatsuya after picking up her bag.



After Tatsuya activated the maintenance device, Mayumi handed him her CAD and plopped down beside him.

Not across from him.

Mayumi wasn’t wearing her cooling jacket that extended to her knees so she was still in her “tennis uniform” that she wore for the match, but this wasn’t because she was in a teasing mood, rather that Tatsuya was no longer causing her to feel unnaturally cold.

The two of them were close enough that their shoulders could rub against one another, but Tatsuya never spared a glance towards her exposed thighs.

Nor was Mayumi upset by this.

Her concentration was completely devoted to the maintenance device as well as the personal CAD currently attached to the machine.

“Don’t you need to measure my current status?”

“The duration was only a paltry 10 to 15 minutes, so even if I could rewrite the code, there wouldn’t be any time to test it, so there would be little point in taking the extra time to run measurements.”

This occurred quite often during their mutual conversation, but this time Mayumi involuntarily tilted her head.

According to what he just said, this sounded like he could get a ballpark estimate completely independent of the machine……

“……You can tell visually?”

“Of course, surely the President knows as well?”

“That……”

“The President also knows that as long as they’re Magicians, they can tell whether magic’s activated normally or if a CAD is functioning normally without the use of machines, right?”

“This I know.”

“On some level, I’m just a little more knowledgeable.”

Tatsuya continued to watch the scrolling character strings.

Mayumi was very interested in exactly what this “some level” was, but she didn’t dare to disturb an engineer at work to satiate her curiosity.

Tatsuya removed the CAD from the maintenance device and turned off the power before inspecting the trigger and Activation Sequence circuit, then personally handed the CAD back to Mayumi.

Just as he promised, he never touched the code inside.

Mayumi privately heaved a sigh of relief (she thought she managed to hide it, but Tatsuya saw everything), but owing to some reason, after she received the CAD, she curled her finger around the trigger and put it on her thigh.

“President…… That’s a little disconcerting, can you not point the muzzle at me?”

Strictly speaking, a CAD doesn’t have a “muzzle”.

Large, rifle-shaped CADs are usually equipped with image detectors at the front that gives the impression of the “muzzle” from a laser gun, but regardless of whether it was a long or short model, the “gun barrel” was made of metal.

Still, the overall design mirrored that of a real firearm, so those that are aware of the danger guns pose would naturally feel uncomfortable staring down the “muzzle”.

“Ah, sorry.”

Tatsuya wasn’t certain how familiar Mayumi was with this situation, but she frankly apologized and shifted her CAD and left the muzzle pointed at herself.

“I should be the one apologizing for troubling you with such trivialities.”

“Please don’t concern yourself, this is basic manners after all. So how is it?”

Mayumi’s question was once again overly simplified, but Tatsuya had no problems navigating through her cryptic meaning.

“I felt that the calibration was well executed. No overclocking, no unnecessary unique features, it was a faithful job done strictly by the rules. There was an overemphasis on stability that led to a more convoluted Activation Sequence in some areas, but taking the President’s Magic Power into consideration, I’d say this garners full marks.”

At any rate, this wasn’t the time for needless flattery or nitpicking, so Tatsuya bluntly made his assessment.

Tatsuya answered this question with his eyes still watching the Activation Sequence display on the maintenance device, so when he turned around — he discovered Mayumi in a profound state of embarrassment.

“Is that so……? Hehehe, that makes me incredibly happy.”

The corners of her eyes were dyed pink as she slightly averted her eyes with a bashful smile.

Compared to blushing obviously, this reaction was even more awkward.

“……Is that so?”

The reason why Tatsuya asked was that he was honestly lost on how to respond, but the real question lurking at the bottom of his heart was that Mayumi should have long been inured to hearing such praise on a daily basis.

“Indeed, to receive the compliments of someone who usually gives scant praise, isn’t that something worthy of being happy about?”

Tatsuya didn’t believe that he was a completely mature adult.

From an objective standpoint, he felt that he was still an immature child.

That being said, Mayumi’s assessment made him out to be one of the fringe members of society unable to feign politeness, which he thoroughly disagreed with.

“……I can be just as polite as anyone else.”

However, Tatsuya’s rebuttal only earned a sweet smile from Mayumi that clearly said she saw through his subterfuge.

“So you were just being polite just now?”

“……No, I wasn’t.”

Mayumi’s delighted smile struck Tatsuya in the wrong way, but continuing this conversation served no practical purpose.

Also, there was no reason he had to respond in the first place.

Unruffled, Tatsuya calmly accepted Mayumi’s smile.



Among the events in the Nine Schools Competition, “Crowd Ball” was the event with the most matches this day.

In terms of pure number of matches, “Monolith Code” was the one sport among the other six that had the most matches. “Crowd Ball” and “Icicle Destruction” each had five, but “Monolith Code” and “Icicle Destruction” were split across two days, whereas “Crowd Ball” had to finish all 5 matches within half a day.

The allotted time was short, but the nature of the event and the fact that each session lasted three minutes with almost continuous magic invocation with no chance to catch a breather combined to create a situation that was in no way less arduous than the other events.

Thus, how to gauge the use of Magic Power was absolutely vital for seizing the gold in this event.

The goal was, of course, two consecutive victories.

During the match, the players weren’t trying to send back every ball haphazardly, but to take into account which shots should be allowed to score in order to properly pace themselves.

Mayumi, who could continuously channel her magic throughout the entire session, was undoubtedly an outlier in this situation.

Even so, Mayumi didn’t charge forward and rely solely on her strength in battle.

She also adopted strategies of her own.

Two consecutive victories was absolutely mandatory — this would prevent people from saying “Wait, didn’t she just power through to victory?”

By choosing magic that was unsuited to this event by solely rebounding the balls back, this was to avoid exhaustion from continuously replicating magic — this also denied people from claiming that “She’s not actually rationing her Magic Power, right?”

Owing to these reasons, her philosophy in battle was to go all out from the start without a trace of hesitation.

Yet, when the second round started, Mayumi was struck by a rare sense of confusion.

Her status was excellent.

Just like earlier, half the round was already over with her opponent unable to score a single point during the first match.

Her confusion came from a completely opposite reason.

(How……?)

True, thanks to her opponent withdrawing from the first round, she had more time to rest than usual.

Still, this was a tightly packed schedule with 5 rounds crammed into half a day.

Usually, her mental and physical status would be gradually worn down from exhaustion, but they would definitely not show a marked improvement that even she could notice.

Thus, there must be some reason behind this highly unusual circumstance.

Mayumi could only think of one possible explanation.

As soon as the ending whistle sounded—

Mayumi decided to interrogate her perfidious underclassman.

“Tatsuya-kun, I thought you said you didn’t alter the Activation Sequence?”

This was completely opposite from how the first round ended.

As soon as the judges confirmed the end of the round, Mayumi stormed to where Tatsuya was on the sidelines.

Mayumi’s accusatory appearance caught Tatsuya by surprise, but he still replied back in a calm manner.

“I never touched the Activation Sequence and there shouldn’t be any performance issues, unless you noticed something wrong?”

“Liar!”

Mayumi pointed a finger at Tatsuya’s nose, her whole stance quivered like it was about to give off “Bishi!” sound.

“The efficiency of magic construction was significantly higher and, since there was no time to change the hardware, the only possibility is that you altered the software!”

“……So the efficiency coefficient wasn’t lower, but higher?”

Tatsuya’s clearly befuddled question took the wind out of Mayumi’s sails.

“That’s true…… But……”

This would be a whole other story if efficiency dropped, but Mayumi finally noticed that her attitude was wholly ridiculous for someone coming to complain that her performance had shown marked improvement.

“Regardless, why don’t you take a seat first?”

Still wearing a baffled expression, Tatsuya handed her a towel, which Mayumi accepted awkwardly before sitting down with a look of consternation on her face.

“The efficiency coefficient rose likely because the garbage was removed.”

Tatsuya sat half a body length away from Mayumi and intentionally didn’t watch her as he softly settled her down.

“Don’t mess around with me. I was watching you the entire time. You didn’t take apart the CAD for cleaning, nor did you use any cleaning fluids, correct?”

Mayumi said petulantly, but Tatsuya replied back patiently.

“No, I wasn’t cleaning the hardware, I was removing the unnecessary software.”

CAD performance was also affected by the user’s mental condition.

If the user didn’t trust the engineer, then this would obviously negatively impact the CAD’s performance.

Since he did act without giving prior warning, which meant that he did not go through the informed consent phase, Tatsuya still felt that it was necessary for him to give an in-depth explanation.

“The President’s CAD had system files left over from earlier versions of the OS, so I had these removed. While previous system files rarely accumulate these garbage files, that doesn’t mean that they are completely removed either. By completely erasing these files, CAD performance can be improved by a few percentage points. However, this usually would not bring about an immediately noticeable improvement, hence I didn’t inform you beforehand. This just goes to show that the President’s senses are just that refined and I was being overly rash.”

“Ah, that…… If that’s all it is, then don’t worry about it.”

Tatsuya’s excessive bow and apology prompted Mayumi to frantically wave both her hands.

“In that case, this also shows that Tatsuya-kun was dutiful in all regards, so I should be the one apologizing for suspecting you in the first place.”

When Tatsuya raised his head, Mayumi was also bowing to him in apology.

Tatsuya couldn’t help but note how swiftly she was able to shift gears.

“Then, let’s end this conversation here.”

He also felt that she was someone who could readily admit her own mistakes.

“You’re right.”

Must be from a composure born of maturity.

“Then, Tatsuya-kun……”

Even so, it wasn’t like she was taking the high ground either.

“What is it?”

“That calibration method…… or do you call it garbage cleanup? Can you teach me later?”

No ill intent whatsoever.

“No problem, but please focus on your next match.”

“Of course, leave that to Onee-san!”

At this stage, choosing to adopt an older sister’s attitude could make anyone smile.



And so, Mayumi completely denied her opponent from scoring a single point. She won every match 2-0 without yielding a single point and took sole possession of the crown for the Women’s “Crowd Ball”.




“Icicle Destruction”, also known simply as “Pillar Knock”, was held in an outdoor arena that was 12 meters long and 24 meters wide. The field was divided into two halves, each with 12 ice pillars that were 1 meter wide and 2 meters tall, with the victor destroying all the pillars in the opposite field first.

Thanks to this, “Icicle Destruction” required preparation on a massive scale.

Requiring hundreds of huge ice pillars that needed to be kept frozen during the height of summer, it greatly limited the number of arenas, even with the military’s complete support.

Owing to the limits on ice production, the Nine Schools Competition could only afford to prepare two arenas for both the Men’s Team and Women’s Team for a total of 4 arenas. Each of the two sites had 12 matches in the first round and six matches in the second round for a total of 18 matches, which was the maximum limit for one day.

“Nevertheless, this is a contest that severely depletes Magic Power. If they held every match in one day, many of the players wouldn’t make it. For the single elimination contest on the second day, there’s an extremely short interval between each match. Thus, there is some truth in the saying that ‘Icicle Destruction is won by those with the greatest stamina’.”

Tatsuya was lecturing on the details while the one listening and nodding was Shizuku.

Miyuki was also present, but if his sister was the only one here, then Tatsuya wouldn’t have to explain at this particular time.

The three of them weren’t in the audience stands, but the auxiliary working area.

Their goal was to watch Kanon’s match from close proximity to get a first hand experience of what the contest was like.

Kanon was busy discussing the final details with Isori, so this wasn’t a good time to interrupt them.

Everyone went to watch the Men’s “Crowd Ball” contest.

Sayaka came to cheer on Kirihara, Erika chose to accompany her and roped Mizuki into the mix, then Mizuki invited Mikihiko to come along, finally culminating with Mikihiko grabbing Leo. And that’s how it was.

After hearing Miyuki’s report, Tatsuya maintained a “what a duplicitous bunch” feeling. As for who among them was duplicitous, some things are better left unsaid.

Kanon finally stepped onto the stage.

There were two platforms that stood four meters high at the two ends of the arena.

The players had to use magic to defend the icicles in their own half of the court while simultaneously destroying their opponent’s icicles.

After entering the arena, all restrictions on magic safety were removed, so this was publicly acknowledged to be the most intense of all the magic contests.

“Shiba-kun.”

After seeing Kanon off to the platform, Isori turned to wave at Tatsuya.

“Let’s go too.”

Isori invited Miyuki and Shizuku, who brought Tatsuya with them.



Behind the platforms where the players stood, there was a special observation deck for support personnel.

Here, there were several devices responsible for monitoring the players’ physical condition as well as a large window for viewing the competition.

“How’s Chiyoda-senpai’s status?”

Tatsuya felt that it was impolite to remain silent, so he supplied an icebreaker question.

“She’s very motivated, to the point that I’m a little concerned that she’s too fired up and will lose steam in tomorrow’s matches.”

With a smile on his face, Isori answered Tatsuya’s customary question.

There was no trace of unease on his face.

“I heard that senpai won the first round with the fastest time ever recorded.”

“Well, that is Kanon’s personality…… I earnestly hope that she would be a little more prudent, so those watching over her could relax somewhat.”

Tatsuya was quite interested in Isori’s wry smile and response.

Tatsuya was accompanying Mayumi all through the morning, so of course he missed the first round in the morning.

He only knew that Kanon claimed the first round using the least amount of time possible.

That being said, while the match time was very short, quite a few of her own icicles had fallen

“It’s starting.”

Shizuku’s soft voice prompted Tatsuya to direct his gaze back towards the arena.



With the shrill sound of the starting whistle, the earth groaned.

“Mine Genesis.”

This was no Mine Field, this was Mine Genesis.

The scene before Tatsuya’s eyes forced him to speak its name.

Versatility and speed were the crowning advantages of Modern Magic. Nonetheless, Magicians are also human, so there are fields where they specialize at or are not adept at.

Since magic talent is inherited, blood relations within a family naturally share similar aptitudes towards magic fields.

The Yotsuba Family, with each family member excelling in a unique area, was a notable exception.

Within influential families, besides everyone’s individual names, family members that share a notable skill usually share a second name as well — almost like a special title.

Some of the more famous ones include the Juumonji Family’s “Phalanx”.

The Ichijou Family’s “Rupture”.

The Saegusa Family did not have a system that they did not excel at, so they were ironically referred to as “Omnipotent”.

The Chiba Family was known as “Magic Swordsman” — this title referred more to their skills and techniques than any unique talent the family possessed, but was still used to refer to this family as a whole.

The Chiyoda Family was known as “Mine Genesis”.

The Magicians of the Chiyoda Family specialized in using Long Range Solid Matter Oscillation Systematic Magic, particularly when it comes to using Earthshaker magic.

Dirt, rock, sand, cement, all materials were irrelevant.

A powerful oscillation could be applied as long as the solid matter was recognized as the “Earth’s surface”. This was the true face of the Chiyoda Family’s specialty “Mine Creation”, with the Chiyoda Family’s title derived from “Mine Creator” = “Mine Genesis”.





The opposing field suffered vertical vibrations that ran perpendicular to the epicenter, with two icicles collapsing each time.

Her opponent tried to counter with Move-Type Magic “Compulsory Arrest” in an effort to stifle any motion on part of the object, but “Mine Genesis” continued switching targets at a speed that her opponent was unable to match, so by the time five of her twelve pillars had collapsed, her opponent abandoned all pretense of defense and concentrated solely on the attack.

“Huh?”

“What?”

“?”

Tatsuya and the others all expressed their astonishment in different ways, whereas Isori smiled wryly from the side.

As he watched the pillars on his side collapse without any resistance, he shook his head helplessly.

“Should I commend Kanon for going all out or criticize her for being overly reckless…… Her methodology revolves around going for the jugular before she gets KO’ed.”

“No, well…… I hardly feel that this is the wrong tactic.”

Her opponent had switched from defense to offense, and her resistance was suitably lowered.

By the time the number of pillars left on her side dipped to six, Kanon had already collapsed every pillar in her opponent’s territory.

“Victory!”

Kanon smiled widely as she flashed a victory signal while descending from the platform.

The target of her smile was, of course, Isori.

Isori’s face plainly said “what am I going to do with you”, but he was wearing the same smile.

“How should I describe this……”

“Match made in heaven?”

Miyuki was reluctant to voice her opinion, but Shizuku had no such compunctions.

“You two should say that they understand one another perfectly.”

Hearing the two of them, Tatsuya smiled wryly for a completely different reason.

Still, Tatsuya also acknowledged that they were a “match made in heaven”.

The two of them had a lot of synergy.

The player and the auxiliary, even though they didn’t step onto the stage together, the two of them were in the fight as one.

Yet — Tatsuya thought.

If they were a pair with so much synergy, would Isori be able to fulfill his duties to the utmost when paired with other players?

There were 40 players and only 8 technicians.

On average, each technician was responsible for five players.

Tatsuya was in charge of the 1st Year Women’s Team, but that was still six people, seven if you counted the the impromptu addition in the morning.

Once they forged an intense emotional bond with one individual player, could they put forth their all with the other players?

Tatsuya was also facing that quandary.

Would he really go all in for Shizuku or Honoka the same way he would for Miyuki?

“……Shiba-kun, what’s up?”

“No, it’s nothing.”

It’s not like he could actually ask Isori something like “Do you work so hard for every player?”.

Tatsuya replied back in a completely inane and normal manner to muddle through Isori’s question.




After securing advancement to the third round, Kanon and company — with Tatsuya, Miyuki and Shizuku in tow — returned to the pavilion in high spirits, only to frown at the dour atmosphere suffusing the camp.

“……What happened?”

Isori asked Suzune, who was probably the only one who maintained her usual attitude.

Suzune turned around to reveal an even more blank emotion than normal.

“The Men’s ‘Crowd ball’ event didn’t perform as expected — we’re recalculating the odds right now.”

The standings in the Nine Schools Competition were determined by the aggregate score from each event.

First Place received 50 points, Second Place received 30 points, and Third Place received 20 points.

Fourth Place finishes in “Speed Shooting”, “Battle Board”, and “Mirage Bat” netted 10 points. “Crowd Ball” and “Icicle Destruction” only awarded points to the top three, so the three teams that are eliminated in the third round each receive 5 points.

For “Monolith Code”, First Place would receive 100 points, Second Place receives 60 points, and Third Place only gets 40 points, which makes it the single largest event in terms of points.

Half the points from the Newcomers Division would be added into the total.

This was the score breakdown for the Nine Schools Competition.

Anyone not in the top four or six would receive no points, so even if First Place was out of the question, taking Second through Fourth place was still valuable in scoring points to contest the overall victor. According to this breakdown, advancing as many players in as many contests as possible to the single elimination or duel phases was one of the keys to victory.

“Not performed as expected means……”

“The players were eliminated during the first, second, and third rounds.”

Isori asked with trepidation while the voice that answered him was quite indifferent by comparison.

“While we held onto next year’s right to compete, this result was thoroughly unexpected.”

The voice was largely indifferent likely because the person being questioned was struck heavily by the news.

Compared to the other events, the Men’s “Crowd Ball” lineup was certainly lacking in firepower.

Regardless of the fact they didn’t possess an ace like the Women’s “Speed Shooting”, “Crowd Ball”, and “Battle Board” or the upcoming Men’s “Icicle Destruction” who was “assured of victory”, they still should possess enough talent to compete for First Place.

“The Newcomers Division is a little harder to estimate, but based on our current lead, if the Women’s ‘Battle Board’, Men’s ‘Icicle Destruction’ as well as ‘Mirage Bat’ and ‘Monolith Code’ all seize First Place, we’re still in the clear.”

A 2nd Year student from the tactical advisory team made the report.

Tatsuya, who was just listening as a bystander, felt that this threshold was a little high.

Including both the Men’s and Women’s contests, they wanted to claim First Place in four of the six remaining events in the Official Division.

Katsuto and Mari could be relied on to win the gold in their respective events, but based on these calculations, if any accident were to occur, they ran the risk of morale reaching a breaking point.

Still — this wasn’t something that Tatsuya had to concern himself with.

He was probably overstepping his boundaries by worrying about these things.

Compared to the points, Tatsuya personally was more mindful about something else.

Kirihara was participating in the Men’s “Crowd Ball” event.

Certainly, Kirihara had a reckless side to him, but he also possessed a strong sense of duty.

He wouldn’t be depressed because of this turnout, would he……?




After the day’s events had drawn to a close, Tatsuya found Kirihara near the hotel’s rest area close to dusk.

Outwardly, he looked perfectly normal.

Sayaka was sitting next to Kirihara.

Kirihara was working hard to keep up a cheerful appearance, but Tatsuya could tell at a glance that he was forcing a smile.

“Kirihara-senpai, thanks for your hard work.”

“Ho, so it’s Shiba.”

Of course, Tatsuya could have chosen to pass by the rest area without saying a word, but he didn’t do so.

“I was taken out early in the second round, and quite badly at that.”

He was definitely putting on a strong front, but he recovered faster than Tatsuya suspected.

Maybe athletes were more accustomed to victory and defeat and were more resilient when it came to dealing with the bitterness of defeat.

Tatsuya always lost when he was trading blows with his master so he didn’t have any real “competitive” experience, and could only rely on logic to explain this.

Tatsuya was unable to judge whether this was an appropriate moment to offer words of comfort, so he elected to speak the truth.

“Senpai was unlucky to draw Third High’s ace that was favored to win the event in the second round and only lost by a grand total of eight points after losing three out of five matches. This favored player was exhausted from the long struggle with senpai and was promptly eliminated in the third round, so this was a Pyrrhic victory for him as well.”

“……Man, you’re one blunt guy.”

Tatsuya never bothered to sugarcoat the defeat and delivered a cold analysis that didn’t smack of comfort, but Kirihara wasn’t angry.

“You never thought that I would be depressed?”

Kirihara’s tone and expression were more teasing than anything else.

“I did, but I couldn’t think of any consolation.”

The scene was dead silent for a few seconds.

Kirihara suddenly burst into laughter.

And he was laughing to the point that he was bent over the sofa.

Enough to thoroughly discomfit Sayaka by his side.

Tatsuya continued to watch him without any expression.

“Shiba…… You really are an interesting guy. Usually, now would be the time to wear a totally~ awkward expression and quickly pass me pretending not to see me, not the time to actually sit down and talk.”

That choice — intentionally overlooking him — was also on the table, but Tatsuya believed that wordlessly passing by wasn’t cordial enough. However, this time it looked like Tatsuya was being a “busybody”.

Tatsuya realized that he shouldn’t even be taking how cordial he was into consideration since that didn’t jibe with his personality, but……

“Still, I feel a lot better thanks to you. Since you said it was a ‘Pyrrhic victory’, then that must be how it was. This shows that I’ve still got a lot of potential.”

……Looks like that wasn’t the case.

Whether Kirihara truly believed that was immaterial.

Likewise, whether this was truly the result Tatsuya was aiming for was also immaterial.




Despite the outcome falling into considerable doubt, the basic personnel duties did not change very much.

The ones responsible for odd jobs and errands might claim otherwise, but since Tatsuya was a member of the technician team, the brass from First High wasn’t foolish enough to have him work on menial tasks and run the risk of endangering his original duties.

After preparing for the Newcomers Division two days from now, double checking the physical and mental conditions of the players under his care and running a final compatibility test for CADs, today’s work schedule came to a close.

Tatsuya received a long package in the mail from the hotel counter and returned to his own room.

It wasn’t dinner time yet.

There was still ample time left, so Tatsuya opted to test the item in the package.

He took a glance at the clock to verify when the dining hall opened.

There was still a significant interval until he had to meet up with Miyuki.

Tatsuya unpacked the parcel and gazed at the contents within.

This was something he called Four Leaves Technology’s CAD Development 3rd Division in the early hours of the morning for.

The components were all universal, the shape exceedingly simple, and was assembled to the point that an automatic construction device could do the rest by reading the manual. Even so, the fact that this could be assembled and shipped all within half a day was quite impressive.

(I hope Ushiyama-san isn’t pushing himself again……)

Should he be saying pushing himself, or pushing his subordinates?

Tatsuya took great pains to carefully remind them that this item was “partially out of curiosity”.

Regardless, Tatsuya couldn’t “really” turn back the clock, so fussing over these details was useless at this point.

After he opened the package and took a look inside, he found a combination seal around a long, thin container. This case was usually intended to transport CADs with the dimensions of a shotgun.

Tatsuya punched in the usual code.

There was a “sword” inside the box.

The item Tatsuya removed from the box had the outward appearance of a long sword with an upgraded hand guard.

The entire length measured 70 cm, and 50 cm without the hand guard — that was how it was shaped.

There was no blade.

This did not refer to the lack of an edge, but the fact that this tool was never forged to be a “sword”.

The literal meaning of the words seemed paradoxical, but a better description would be “a metallic bokken forged to look like a long sword”.

Or maybe it was “flat rod with an added hand guard”.

This item was plainly not any ordinary rod.

After thumbing the activation button and upping the psion intake, a familiar feeling passed across Tatsuya’s hand.

This item was in the same vein as Erika’s police baton in that it was a weapon that concealed a CAD.

The utility was even more restricted than a Specialized CAD and could only provide one Activation Sequence. Erika’s CAD was a Specialized model that retained the ability to switch abilities. In comparison, this was a Specialized CAD that possessed only one function, making it a prototype for “Weaponized Integrated CADs”.

Tatsuya measured the distance to the wall to gauge whether he should take a test swing when someone knocked on the door. The perfect timing caused Tatsuya to chuckle wryly as he placed the prototype on the table.

There was some time until the arranged meeting time, but given that the presence on the other side of the door did nothing to conceal themselves, he knew that friends had come calling.

And this prototype suited that friend very well.

Rather than testing this himself, it would be far more interesting to have that guy handle it — Tatsuya thought as he opened the door.

“Onii-sama, is this a good time?”

The leader and the one who spoke up first was his little sister.

Tatsuya pushed the door open and beckoned everyone inside. Erika, who was following Miyuki, came close enough that the two of them were almost touching.

Next, Honoka, Shizuku, Mizuki, and Leo came in, with Mikihiko bringing up the rear.

Rather than saying ladies first, it would be more appropriate to say this was how the pecking order went.

Still, while this was a double room for the sake of storing equipment, it was still a squeeze with so many people piling in at once.

Just the chairs and bed weren’t enough, someone even had to sit on the table — which was neatly ordered and not the least bit sloppy, so Tatsuya had no complaints.

Erika was the one sitting on the table, so of course she was the one who noticed the “sword” on the table, and it naturally aroused her interest.

“Tatsuya-kun, is that…… a blade replica? Except it looks more like a sword.”

“Negative.”

“Then an iron whip?”

“Also negative…… I don’t think the samurai of this country would use weapons like iron whips.”

“Who uses the term samurai in this day and age…… Then what is it? ……Ah, is it a Houki?”

Erika flipped it over and examined both sides and asked again upon noticing the trigger on the handle.

“Correct, to be precise, this is a Weaponized Integrated CAD, commonly known as weaponized calculation devices. The CAD is specifically attuned to use one type of magic only that can also double as a close combat weapon that uses aforementioned magic.”

“Wow……”

The reason why Erika made this sound wasn’t because the Weaponized Integrated CAD was incredibly rare, but because this was the first time she saw one in the form of a “sword”. Erika wasn’t the only one gazing at the sword in her hand, both Honoka and Shizuku were looking on with deep interest.

Miyuki’s face revealed an “Ah, so that’s what it was” expression, clearly because she remembered the conversation from last night.

Neither Mizuki nor Mikihiko expressed any interest, probably because they preferred familiar objects rather than foreign materials.

Tatsuya glanced at the other person standing to the side and smiled mischievously as he plucked the prototype from Erika’s hands.

“Leo.”

And tossed it towards Leo, who was standing off to one side with his face averted.

“Whoa! Tatsuya, isn’t that kind of dangerous?”

In reality, Leo was burning to give it a go, but he feigned disinterest due to his ongoing cold war against his nemesis Erika, so while he was outwardly frantic, he eagerly grabbed hold of the sword hilt.

Tatsuya completely ignored his protest and sent a challenging smirk his way.

“Want to give it a try?”

“Eh, me?”

Leo’s mouth split into a wide grin.

To the side, Erika wore a “This guy is easy to read……” expression, to which Tatsuya spared only a single glance before directing his attention back to Leo.

“This weaponized calculation device was created by merging a striking weapon with the Fortifying Magic that Watanabe-senpai used during the ‘Battle Board’ event, with the blade also serving as a slashing weapon after being reforged, so I think this suits you very well.”

“So Tatsuya made this?”

“Yes.”

“Hold on.”

Mikihiko inserted himself into Leo and Tatsuya’s conversation.

Initially, he wore an apathetic expression, but he was paying attention to the entire conversation.

“Watanabe-senpai’s event was yesterday, so you made this in one day? This doesn’t look like a ready-made product.”

“The components themselves are all commonplace. The outer frame is also a generic alloy, so there are no special materials involved.”

“But this still isn’t something you can manually forge, right? You shouldn’t have that much spare time……”

“Why of course, I only came up with the design, then had a familiar factory construct this using automatic assembly devices.”

Miyuki overheard the entire conversation and when she heard the term “familiar factory”, she almost burst into laughter. Thankfully, she regularly prepared several masks for occasions like these, so she didn’t draw any attention to herself or her brother.

“So Leo…… Want to give it a try?”

Tatsuya’s words were like the sweet whispers of the demon Mephistopheles.

Even while knowing something was afoot, the lure was irresistible.

“……OK, I’ll be your guinea pig.”

“He fell for it.”

Shizuku’s soft whisper succinctly reflected everyone’s inner thoughts.



Next, Tatsuya pulled out a HMD with light refracting mirrors and a speaker attached.

“This is the instruction manual.”

Seeing the HMD in front of him, Leo seemed to not comprehend Tatsuya’s words as a question mark sprouted on his head.

“Take a look, the user’s manual for the weaponized calculation device is recorded within.”

“Ah? Oh……”

This object that Tatsuya handed him (more like tossed to him) appeared to have images and sound files stored on it, which included the Weaponized Integrated CAD instruction manuals. Leo let out an “I get it now” expression and accepted the HMD from Tatsuya’s hands.

“This counts as a virtual terminal device, right?”

Honoka, who asked the question, wasn’t the only one wondering about this.

Virtual information terminal devices posed considerable harm to immature Magicians.

With this in mind, First High forbade students from using virtual terminal devices.

Tatsuya himself insisted on using a material terminal device, but asked his friend to use a virtual terminal device. Even if the device was restricted to visual and hearing, everyone held the same misgivings.

“It’s nothing that outrageous, but they do share some similarities.”

“……Is this OK?”

“Huh? Oh…… You’re referring to the harm caused by the virtual terminal device?”

“Uh…… Yeah.”

“There’s no need to worry on that account. The risks from virtual terminal devices arise from the user’s inexperience. If used strictly for testing realistic conditions, then it’s actually quite a valuable tool.”

“I don’t follow……”

Honoka’s tone towards Tatsuya was very polite, but there were traces of Miyuki’s influence mixed in.

“Magic is a skill that uses perception to temporarily alter reality. Virtual terminal devices create illusions that people mistake for reality.”

Tatsuya’s explanations were always attentive and exhaustive, which possibly was a reflex on his part.

“The two of them share the distinction that they project an unnatural phenomenon into reality. On the other hand, by experiencing the phenomenon through the virtual terminal device, there’s no need to expend energy to rewrite reality, nor is there a risk for spell failure. Herein also lies the risk for virtual terminal devices.”

Tatsuya temporarily stopped at this point.

Because he felt that he was being overly loquacious.

However, his friends that were arrayed in front of him wore equal parts understanding and incomprehension on their faces, so he felt that his explanation wasn’t detailed enough and plodded on.

“Virtual terminal devices would cause a Magician to hallucinate and believe that they can effortlessly alter reality with no consequence. People incapable of using magic wouldn’t run into this problem in the first place. Skilled Magicians would be able to differentiate what they are capable of, but immature Magicians may confuse the difference between what they experienced in the virtual world with what they can actually accomplish and overestimate their abilities.

Once immature Magicians have become accustomed to altering reality without the concepts of hard work or failure, they become unable to reflect upon why they cannot use magic to successfully rewrite reality and lose the ability to think critically and the drive to do so. Hence the popular belief that immature Magicians still studying magic experience harm from using virtual terminal devices.”

Tatsuya paused again to survey his friends’ faces.

Additional explanations were probably unnecessary, but he’d still conclude as a precaution.

“In other words, the problem lies in whether the user believes he or she has accomplished something they were previously unable to. Utilizing virtual terminal devices to test the waters isn’t a problem in and of itself. That type of virtual experience actually benefits the planning phases for constructing Magic Sequences. At the end of the day, it remains extremely challenging to pick out only the benefits, so I feel that a global ban on virtual terminal devices made perfect sense.”

“Is that so…… I actually learned a lot from that.”

Tatsuya felt that Honoka’s nodding was overly zealous and also believed he said too much.

Even if she heavily relied on him, he had no way of responding……

Those were Tatsuya’s heartfelt words.




The test for the prototype calculation device was set after dinner, using one of the outdoor combat training facilities on the outskirts of the Nine Schools Competition area.

Tatsuya didn’t make the arrangements; Erika was the one who called on her connections.

Since arriving here, Erika seemed to be frivolously throwing around her family’s influence in a self-destructive manner.

Did something happen that caused her mental landscape to change?

Speaking of which, Tatsuya recalled that something similar happened during the banquet.

Nevertheless, Tatsuya was powerless to act regardless of how worried he was.

His own emotions were only façades anyways.

It was probably better to look the other way and let an engineer’s curiosity take first priority. This was probably a more honest method to go about it.

Tatsuya convinced himself this way and once again warned himself against butting into other people’s business.

“Leo, do you understand the mechanics?”

Next, he had to focus all his concentration on this test.

Even if this was something done during his leisurely time — even if this was an overly simplified way of applying modern magic — this still broke new ground for testing magic and calculation devices.

If an accident occurred due to his complacency, the one who would bear the brunt of it would be Leo and not Tatsuya.

“Uh, I think so…… But, am I really going to do that?”

“That” likely referred to the demonstrated motions he saw within the HMD.

Likely was the wrong word to use, since that was the only possibility at this point.

“We’re undergoing this test to find out.”

“You’re right.”

This training facility was 30 minutes away from the hotel by foot.

This would pose no problems during the day, but it was night time now.

Likewise, city districts would be fine, but they were located in a military training facility in the mountains.

Miyuki and Erika stubbornly refused to cooperate, but were finally persuaded to remain at the hotel.

Despite this, Tatsuya still remained uneasy, so he called on Honoka to watch Miyuki and Mizuki to keep an eye on Erika.

Now, only Tatsuya and Leo were present.

“Let’s begin.”

“Got it.”

Initially, they weren’t going to use the slashing (more like striking) dummy.

Right now, they needed to verify the movements of the Weaponized Integrated CAD without performing any physical actions.

“Starting now.”

Leo thumbed the activation button on the bottom of the hilt.

With a “clang” sound, a feathery touch crossed his fingers.

He wrapped his index finger around the trigger near the top of the handguard and started supplying psions.

Contrary to his physical impression, Leo’s supply of psions wasn’t explosive, but possessed an inexhaustible durability. Correction, maybe that would be the most suitable description for his youthful and energetic side.

If a CAD was not calibrated for individual use, there would be practically no assistance in constructing Magic Sequences, so there was a small delay as the Activation Sequence was translated into the Magic Sequence.

Approximately 0.6 seconds.

Even so, this was still much swifter than during practical skills class.

This might be caused by his personal expertise in this field of magic, or the outstanding performance from the CAD and Activation Sequence.

Regardless of which one it was or both at the same time, this detail remained unimportant. What was important right now was to observe the activated magic in action and not the time necessary to activate aforementioned magic.

“Oh?”

Leo gasped, not because the magic was activating, but because the effects of inertia far exceeded his expectations.

“Haha, it’s actually floating, how incredible!”





Leo revealed a childlike smile and swung the “sword” that had less than one half of the blade still attached.

The other half of the blade floating in midair mimicked his motion and swung in a similar arc.

“Three, two, one……”

“Whoa…….”

Leo stopped upon hearing Tatsuya counting down.

“Zero.”

With the end of the countdown, the blade swiftly reconnected with the “broken” blade and reformed into a complete “sword”.

“Tatsuya, that was a complete success.”

Leo was wearing a thoroughly delighted expression as he raised a thumb, whereas Tatsuya mirrored his gesture.

“Still, I’m impressed that you could come up with something like this. Detaching the blade from the hilt, then using Fortifying Magic to solidify its position and ‘shoot’ out the blade. I still can’t believe I just did that. Now I know Fortifying Magic can also operate by separating objects.”

“That is because the core concept behind Fortifying Magic is stabilizing relative positions, and if you ignore all the stereotypes, you find that objects don’t have to be physically connected to one another. In addition, the operational form of this CAD is more like ‘extension’ rather than being ‘shot out’.

The blade will only elongate in a linear fashion, since the middle segment is empty space.”

“I never thought about that, I’ll just treat this like a really~ long sword.”

Just as Leo said, this weaponized calculation device wasn’t like other long range system weapons that required additional energy to control, but was simply matching the motion of the blade while flying at a set distance until the magic lost effect.

“Speaking of which, why did the blade come back? I didn’t activate any other magic.”

“Oh, that’s simple. That’s an electric current reaction-type recall alloy, so it only separates the moment an electric current is applied to break the connection.”

Leo nodded to signify his understanding, since this was a popular design in the modern era.

“So if a large force is applied during the state where magic isn’t supplied, this could easily be broken.”

“That’s not a problem, we just have to store it in a scabbard when not in use, right?”

“That’s true, shall we perform live tests on dummies? Or test the fluctuations during separation?”

“Tatsuya, while this thing is separated, is the length adjustable?”

“That’s not impossible, but exceedingly difficult. Currently, the Activation Sequence tied to the activation button on the hilt is set as a constant, but that can be easily changed to a variable. The challenge lies in that whenever the length needs to be adjusted, a new magic needs to overwrite the previous one.”

“Is that the case?”

“If the return speed could be increased, then there’s no need to concern ourselves with the changing distances in between. After all, a real sword can’t elongate itself halfway through the slashing motion.”

“Yet Erika seems to be able to accomplish that feat. What do you plan to do?”

“Well…… Let’s do a dummy test first.”

“Got it.”

Tatsuya manipulated a control mechanism that was slightly larger than a notepad and called up three man-sized straw dolls from the ground.

“……Oldschool.”

“……I wonder whose hobby this is?”

Even though regenerating products had become mainstream in modern society, the oddly outdated design still prompted the two of them to exchange a helpless glance.

“Regardless…… In terms of sheer specs, they’ll do as slashing targets.”

“Straw dolls don’t have any ‘specs’…… But there’s no other choice.”

Leo slapped his face lightly with his empty left hand to focus himself, then fell into a stance against the straw dolls.

He thumbed the power switch.

The blade flew into the sky.

Leo swung the weapon with all his strength.

Ahead of his right arm, the detached blade built up rotational momentum to a respectable speed before smashing into the straw doll.

“Lot of strain on the arm.”

Leo looked like his hand had gone numb, but he lightly swung the restored medium length, sword-like weaponized calculation device as he voiced his thoughts.

“That’s because while the flying part is physically small and despite the fact that speed can supplement strength somewhat, inertia still remains an issue, so you need extra arm strength to compensate.”

“No wonder. So in actual combat, I would need to apply more strength into each of my swings.”

Leo acknowledged Tatsuya’s explanations with a nod of his head and aimed at the next target.

As he watched Leo fall into another combat stance, Tatsuya thought:

(Indeed, even after applying an actual blade, a slight increase in weight would be perfect for combat conditions. Still, this level of power would be appropriate for competition venues.)

The thought circulating in Tatsuya’s mind was the restriction on direct contact during “Monolith Code”. This weaponized calculation device had a flying blade, so it bypassed this restriction.

(……Not that there’s any connection here.)

While he claimed this was strictly a toy, he was still actively considering practical applications. Tatsuya could only secretly laugh at himself.





Chapter 7




It’s the third day of the Nine Schools Competition.

The Men and Women’s “Icicle Destruction” and “Battle Board” were being held today, making this the biggest hurdle of the first half of the Nine Schools Competition.

The players from First High that had advanced thus far included two men in “Icicle Destruction”, two men and women in “Battle Board”, and one woman in “Icicle Destruction”.

This was not going according to plan, but was still within the acceptable combat parameters.

“Hattori-senpai is on first for the Men’s Team, Watanabe-senpai is in the second round for the Women’s Team, Chiyoda-senpai is set for the first round, and Group Leader Juumonji is scheduled for the third round……”

Tatsuya felt a headache forming as he surveyed the schedule.

Even if the start of the contest didn’t coincide perfectly with the schedule, he could only watch either Hattori’s or Kanon’s event.

(Though Hattori-senpai probably doesn’t want me to watch him compete……)

That being said, Miyuki and Hattori were both part of the Student Council, so not watching Hattori’s contest was still a problem.

“Ah, found you, Tatsuya-kun!”

Still, Tatsuya no longer had to concern himself with this, or maybe he no longer had to concern himself period.

“President, what’s the matter?”

“I was hoping you could help.”

Mayumi dragged Tatsuya towards the engineering vehicles.




“Onii-sama, it’s about to start!”

In the end, Tatsuya barely got away in time to catch the start of Mari’s event.

Mari had dropped by when Tatsuya was working and specifically reminded him: “You are going to come watch me, right?” If he stayed away after that, even if he was just a little tardy and missed the opening segment, he would never hear the end of it.

Tatsuya thanked his little sister and friends for saving him a spot, then turned to look at the starting line.

Looks like he made it just in time.

Mari was wearing her customary headband with her hair fluttering as she adopted the set position.

There were a total of three contestants in the semifinal round, which would run for two matches.

The winners of the two matches would advance to the final round where they would duel one another.

The two others were tense with anxiety, but Mari fearlessly awaited the starting signal.

The “Get Set” whistle sounded.

The audience was dead silent.

After a split second, the second whistle rang out.

The race was on.



The first one out the gate was Mari.

Unlike the preliminary round, the one in second was right on her heels.

The player in third was only slightly further behind.

“They’re tough……!”

“No wonder they’re known as ‘Seventh High of the Waves’.”

“I remember that they had the same team in last year’s finals.”

The billowing waves on the surface were clear evidence that their magic was interfering with one another.

Generally, Mari would use her position in the lead to take advantage of the waves to disrupt her opponent behind her, hereby achieving greater effect than the sum of its parts, but the player from Seventh High adeptly maneuvered her board to compensate for her disadvantage in magic.

The three players threaded through the snaking aqueduct and rounded the tight corner neck to neck.

After passing through there, they entered a passage that couldn’t be seen from the observation deck, so now the action had to be watched through the television screens.

Tatsuya glanced towards the widescreen TV that was displaying the images from the sharp turn.

“Huh?”

A small oddity onscreen grabbed his attention.

“Ah!”

So Tatsuya accidentally missed this moment.

Screams erupted from the stands.

Tatsuya frantically looked back.

The player from Seventh High had completely lost her balance.

“Speed Burst?”

Someone shouted out.

That’s certainly what it looked like.

The player’s board wasn’t gripping the water’s surface.

As if in full flight, the player from Seventh High was gliding across the water’s surface and was about to slam straight into the railing.

—Under the assumption that no one was in the way.

Mari, who had just finished decelerating and was ready to sprint ahead, was directly in the path of the trajectory.

Mari faced the railing.

Even so, she still kept her head turned behind her, likely because she detected the oncoming presence from the rear.

Her following action, could only be described as superlative.

Mari canceled her forward acceleration and switched to parallel rotational acceleration, using the waves crashing back from the walls of the aqueduct and her own magic to spin the board halfway around.

Next, she used multiple recalculations to use two new magics and prepared to receive the out of control Seventh High player.

First she used Move-Type Magic to fling away the player’s board and then applied Weight-Type Inertial Neutralization Magic to prevent herself from crashing into the railing after catching the other player.

This would have been enough to avert disaster.

If the water’s surface didn’t suddenly dip.

It was only a minute difference.

However, Mari was in the middle of a high level technique to achieve a 180 degree turnaround.

Mari wasn’t a surfing expert, she was just using superb magic and personal buffing to change her stance. The moment her flotation faded, her balance was destroyed as well.

Which in turn caused the activating magic to fizzle.

She successfully redirected the other player’s board that was hurtling towards her legs.

But the Inertial Neutralization Magic didn’t activate, which sent the player from Seventh High careening into Mari.

The two of them slammed into the railing together.

Shrill shrieks sounded from all around the stands.

Immediately, a flag rose to signal a halt to the competition.

Tatsuya couldn’t help but rise to his feet.

Mari was sandwiched between the railing and the player from Seventh High.

It looked like she wasn’t able to successfully erect any protective measures.

“Onii-sama!”

Completely pale, Miyuki was gazing up at him.

“I’ll go take a look, you guys stay here.”

Tatsuya had received military and guardian training since youth, which more than qualified him for minor surgical operations.

“Understood.”

Tatsuya’s steady voice allowed Miyuki to realize that everyone going to take a look would only add to the panic, so she waved her hands to signal their friends to take a seat and nodded her assent towards Tatsuya.

Tatsuya charged down the observation deck and threaded through the dense crowds as if performing a magic trick.




She did not wake very quickly.

There seemed to be a thick cloud hanging over her consciousness, so it was difficult to grasp her surroundings.

What was she doing here……?

This was the first question that flashed across Mari’s mind as she awoke.

“Mari, are you awake? Do you know who I am?”

An evil friend — even at this time in the privacy of her mind, Mari still didn’t apply the term “friend” — could be seen in front of her face.

Mari knew the literal meaning of the question, but was unable to comprehend why the question was asked, so she murmured in confusion—

“Mayumi, what are you talking about? Why would you ask……”

—Halfway through her sentence, Mari recalled the reason why Mayumi asked the question as well as her current predicament.

“So I’m in the hospital……”

“Yes, the hospital at Susono Base. Thank goodness…… Looks like there was no mental damage.”

“How long was I out?”

There was still a dull throbbing coming from the back of her head, which allowed Mari to realize that she didn’t fall asleep, but was forcefully knocked unconscious after failing to erect defenses in time.

“Since just after noon. Ah, don’t get up yet.”

Mari wanted to sit herself up, but Mayumi quickly pushed her back down.

She didn’t apply a lot of strength, but Mari’s physical mobility was reduced to less than half.

“Your ribs are broken and while they’ve used magic to reconnect them, they still need some time to stabilize. I think you know very well that healing magic is ultimately only an emergency measure.”

“There’s only the outward appearance of recovery during the stabilization period, rather than instantaneous recovery — don’t worry, I know at least that much.”

Mari took the words right out of Mayumi’s mouth as she murmured to herself and sank back down onto the bed.

“How long will I be out?”

“At least a week for a full recovery, though you are cleared for daily activities after one day of bed rest. Still, to be on the safe side, you are forbidden from strenuous activity for the next ten days.”

“Hey, then……!”

“You’ll have to withdraw from ‘Mirage Bat’ too. There’s nothing we can do about that.”

“Is that so……”

Mari sighed and closed her eyes.

She reopened them after a short interval.

“What was the conclusion of the contest?”

“The instigator from Seventh High was banned as punishment with Third and Ninth High advancing to the finals. Kobayakawa-san was highly motivated, so I think we have a chance to seize Third Place.”

“Kobayakawa is more than capable so long as she doesn’t mentally handicap herself.”

“Indeed. By the way, the player from Seventh High didn’t suffer major injuries, so your efforts weren’t wasted.”

“……It doesn’t really count as helping if I’m seriously injured myself.”

Mari scowled as she was complaining, though her “pretense” at negativity drew a light laugh from Mayumi.

Mayumi averted her head and feigned ignorance.

“On the Men’s Team, Hattori-kun advanced to the finals, but Murakami-kun just barely missed out. Juumonji-kun and Kanon-san both advanced to the single elimination portion of ‘Icicle Destruction’ on their respective sides.”

“So I’m the only one who couldn’t fulfill her end of the bargain……”

“It’s not your fault. Mari, you made the right decision. If you didn’t halt your acceleration, you might have been able to narrowly avoid the collision and advance to the finals, but…… The player from Seventh High would likely have suffered serious injury to the point that her life as a Magician might be over, that’s how dangerous her situation was. Tatsuya-kun also concurs.”

“……Hey, why are you bringing up this guy’s name now?”

“Because he was the one who escorted you here and stayed on station while you were undergoing treatment.”

“What?”

“Well, of course we didn’t leave it all to Tatsuya-kun himself…… Shocked?”

Mayumi sported a grin while Mari turned around with a miserable expression on her face.

It was precisely because she felt a tight knot unraveling inside her that Mayumi’s grin irked her even more.

“Naturally, men wouldn’t be present while ladies are changing, so he obediently waited in the corridor while treatment was ongoing. But you better thank him later on. He arrived practically at the same time as the emergency response teams and helped bring you to shore. He also spotted your fractures in one glance and gave the orders for treatment.”

“……Who the devil is this guy?”

Mari’s eyes were wide with amazement while Mayumi nodded deeply.

“How should I put this, he seems very adept at dealing with accidents and victims…… Speaking of which, what’s your status?”

“Why are you asking this now…… I have a small headache, but that’s a strictly physical injury, and my head is clear.”

“Looks like there’s no trauma…… In that case, let me get this over with now.”

“?”

Mayumi pinned the still befuddled Mari with a serious look.

“What’s with the sudden serious attitude?”

“Mari…… At that time, were you hindered by an outsider’s magic?”

“What do you mean?”

“Just as Mari was about to catch the player from Seventh High, did you lose your balance because a third party maliciously used magic to disrupt the water’s surface? This is what I want to express.”

Upon comprehending the intent behind Mayumi’s words, Mari’s eyes glinted with alertness.

“……Just before the board started sinking, I did feel an odd vibration near my feet, but I have no idea if that was caused by magic and even less of an idea if it was malicious…… Why would you think that?”

“When you lost your balance, the water movements were very unnatural, to the point that there is suspicion that this was caused through illogical means like phenomenon rewriting magic. Yet, neither player from the other schools used this magic, so the only remaining possibility is that an outside third party cast this magic. Tatsuya-kun also concurs. I heard that he’s requesting the recording from the committee in order to analyze the fluctuations on the water’s surface. At least we can find out if this was actually caused by unnatural, foreign forces.”

“I would like to call into question why a high school freshman is capable of such an analysis, but let’s table that for now…… Since the other players and I were all using magic, why are we investigating if there were unnatural, foreign forces at work? I for one think this is pointless……”

“Tatsuya-kun said that the players’ magic effects could be taken into account as well to determine if outside forces were acting on the situation. Isori-kun also said that he would go help him after the contests were over today, so I think between the two of them, we can find some meaningful answers. Mari, if you can think of anything else, please let me know. This doesn’t just concern us — the overall standings for First High, this may impact the entire Nine Schools Competition and all the magic high schools combined.”

“…………”

As Mari silently digested this from the bed, Mayumi said “I should go” and departed from the room.

Now alone, Mari directed a solemn gaze towards the ceiling.




Upon hearing the knocking sounds, Miyuki went to open the door and found a pair of 2nd Year students waiting outside.

“Please come in…… Onii-sama, Isori-senpai, and Chiyoda-senpai are here.”

Miyuki’s words prompted Tatsuya to stop typing and rise from his chair.

“Sorry for calling you here.”

“No problem, please don’t worry about that. After all, I was the one who volunteered and couldn’t bring the still active terminal device over here.”

Tatsuya nodded slightly in agreement whereas Isori casually waved a hand.

After thanking him again, Tatsuya turned towards Kanon.

“Chiyoda-senpai, congratulations on winning the gold.”

“Thank you. Since Mari-senpai got caught up in that incident, the rest of us have to work harder on her behalf!”

Hot-blooded would be the perfect way to describe Kanon with her fists clenched, causing Tatsuya to reevaluate her as dazzling.

“So, did we find anything?”

“I’ve gone through the recording once and arrived at the conclusion that this is definitely the work of an outside party. Isori-senpai, would you mind verifying this one more time?”

“Got it…… As expected of Shiba-kun, that was fast.”

Isori accepted the invitation and sat down while using a hand gesture to express his admiration.

There was a modest monitor (standard size, 20 inches) on the table that was split into two screens, one displaying the actual recording itself while the other was strictly the outline of what happened.

Isori picked up the visual pointer shaped like a monocle with a brain wave supplementary add-on and smoothly unfurled the thin, long C-type metal frame around his head, adjusted the monocle over his right eye, and placed his finger on the buttons near the bottom center of the keyboard.

The brain wave supplementary add-on and the visual pointers were originally intended for users to input data without the need to remove their hands from the keyboard, but have since progressed to the point that direct input on the keyboard has become unnecessary.

However, Isori chose to use the original function, which was a pure supplement to keyboard input.

The actual recording and the model images both started moving under Isori’s direction.

He quickly fast forwarded to the moment the incident occurred, then proceeded to play the sequence in slow motion.

Above the model images, lines of data described the changes in the water’s surface.

Within the scene in question, which was when the water’s surface dipped downward, an unknown quantity arose, signifying that the “power” released could not be explained by magic interference from the three players.

Isori paused the image and turned around.

“……This is even more troublesome than we imagined.”

“Kei, what happened?”

“Kanon, you know that in order to prevent outsiders illegally using magic to interfere with the competition, the Nine Schools Competition hired highly skilled counter magic Magicians and stationed them as committee members all over the various arenas, then placed cameras all over the place to observe the situation. Since the network didn’t catch this, I suspected that the culprit acted from a high altitude that exceeds the security network and fired a compressed block of air downwards to cause the dip in the water’s surface. But if that were the case, there’s no way Watanabe-senpai could have missed it and I also realize this is an outrageous hypothesis.

Yet, based on Shiba-kun’s analysis, the dip in the water’s surface originated from within the water itself. If someone utilized a Magic Sequence from outside the aqueduct, the security network would immediately pick up on it. The only natural way for the water’s surface to dip downwards would be a leak, so that possibility can also be ruled out. The only possibility remaining is that someone was hiding in the water for this precise moment…… But that’s almost impossible……”

“Could Shiba-kun’s analysis be incorrect?”

Kanon’s blunt question caused Miyuki to stiffen.

“No.”

However, before Miyuki could speak, Isori denied Kanon’s assertion.

“Shiba-kun’s analysis is flawless, at least it is not within my capability to discern any errors.”

Isori and Kanon both lapsed into silence.

The silence lasted around two minutes before it was broken by more knocking.

Miyuki visually interrogated her brother and only moved to open the door after her brother nodded in agreement.

She quickly returned.

With two classmates in tow.

“Mizuki said that Onii-sama wanted them to come over……”

“Sorry for calling the two of you all the way over here.”

Tatsuya verified his sister’s question and turned to the two upperclassmen.

“Allow me to introduce you: These two are my classmates Yoshida and Shibata. I think you two know these two are Isori-senpai and Chiyoda-senpai from 2nd Year.”

Mikihiko and Mizuki were both a little tense and, after a quick round of self introductions from Isori and Kanon, Tatsuya used a concise answer to respond to the five questioning looks sent his way.

“I asked the two of them to come and identify our culprit.”

This sentence alone was a little too vague for anyone to understand.

Tatsuya knew from the get go, so he kept explaining without pausing.

“We are now examining the possibility that Watanabe-senpai’s incident was caused by malicious interference from an outside party.”

This was for Mikihiko and Mizuki’s benefit.

Mikihiko knit his brows while Mizuki revealed an astounded expression.

“As Watanabe-senpai was losing her balance, an unnatural dip appeared on the water’s surface, which disrupted the timing for her Inertial Neutralization Magic and forced her to collide with the railing. The change on the water’s surface was almost certainly caused by magic cast from within the water.”

Mizuki still hadn’t shaken off her astonishment.

Yet, upon hearing Tatsuya’s words, Mikihiko’s eyes took on a hard look.

“It is strictly impossible to cast magic on the water from outside the stadium without detection. The possibility that this is caused by delayed magic is also low. Because if that was the case, Kobayakawa-senpai would have detected this in the first race.”

Modern magic also had magic that activated after a set delay, but the Magic Sequence must be “recorded” onto the object. Once the delayed magic was cast, the target object would be under the influence of magic rewriting and interfere with the next magic cast on the target object.

“If that is the case, then the only possibility remaining is that something hidden in the water cast the magic — this is the conclusion Isori-senpai and I arrived at.”

Tatsuya visually sought confirmation from Mikihiko and Mizuki, who both nodded in understanding.

“Still, having a living, breathing Magician submerge themselves in water sounds ridiculous. Currently, neither modern magic nor Ancient Magic is able to accomplish this feat flawlessly.”

This time, Tatsuya’s words prompted Isori and Kanon to nod in agreement.

“If that’s the case, a more suitable hypothesis is that ‘something inhuman’ cast magic while hiding in the waterway.”

Isori and Kanon glanced at one another, mirroring each other’s confusion.

After a while, Isori finally asked.

“……Shiba-kun thinks this may be the work of Spirit Magic?”

Tatsuya nodded in response to Isori’s words.

Magicians that use modern magic typically use psion surges to identify magic.

But SB, or Spiritual Beings, are primarily composed of pushions. Pushions are supplements used to “move” the objects around — precisely like ordering spirits around — this was the current dominant theory.

It wasn’t that Magicians couldn’t identify pushions.

Yet, in ordinary circumstances, they couldn’t identify them as readily as psions.

For example, even though the human senses could detect infrared rays as “warmth”, there was no way to distinguish between colors the same way they could for visible light.

Magicians could use their senses to identify active pushions.

But had a very difficult time identifying inactive ones.

In other words, Magicians using modern magic couldn’t detect dormant Spiritual Beings.

If they were using a Spiritual Being planted ahead of time — a type of delayed magic using Spiritual Beings, there was a high probability that they would elude the committee’s detection.

“Yoshida is an expert on Spirit Magic and Shibata is especially sensitive towards pushion light.”

“Hence why you called the two of them.”

Tatsuya once again nodded towards Isori and turned to face Mikihiko.

“Mikihiko, I would like your expert opinion. Is there a way for Spiritual Magic to delay activating for several hours and then selectively create a dip in the water’s surface?”

“Yes.”

Mikihiko immediately replied.

“Based on those conditions, all you would have to do is set the start of the second race as the primary condition, then someone’s approach as the second condition and order the water spirit to create a wave or whirlpool. Even if spirits are off the table, a shikigami can accomplish that too.”

“Can you do it?”

“With enough time to prepare. I cannot do that right this moment, but give me half a month to prepare and repeatedly enter the arena to make the arrangements, I should be able to.”

“Would you need to infiltrate the arena the day before?”

“No need. As long as I’m familiar with the lay of the land, I can use the ley lines to send the spirits, which is the point of investigating beforehand. However……”

“?”

“Even if they managed to accomplish this, there’s almost no power to speak of. Spirits are empowered by the user’s emotions and will, so if it was set several hours beforehand, I feel that the only thing lingering would be something like a practical joke at best.”

“In other words?”

“Even if they could disrupt the water’s surface, they couldn’t use this method to create large enough waves to disrupt Watanabe-senpai’s balance. If the player from Seventh High didn’t happen to lose control at the exact same time, this would be relegated to kid’s play.”

For some reason, Tatsuya gave a massive nod at Mikihiko’s words.

“That’s only under the assumption that it was an accident in the first place……”

“Ah?”

Mikihiko was unable to follow Tatsuya’s cryptic words, but Tatsuya didn’t immediately reply and instead turned his gaze on Mizuki.

“Mizuki, during Watanabe-senpai’s incident, did you see the movements of the SB?”

“……I was wearing my glasses at the time ……Sorry.”

“Please don’t say that. You’re right, that’s my mistake. Mizuki, you don’t have to apologize.”

Tatsuya bowed his head towards the glum Mizuki and Miyuki also came over to comfort her.

“In regards to what we were just talking about……”

Tatsuya turned back to Mikihiko.

Yet Isori and Kanon both knew these words were also directed towards them.

“I feel that the loss of control from the player from Seventh High was not a pure coincidence. Take a look at this.”

Tatsuya brought Mikihiko in front of the monitor and restarted the model images.

He was also paying attention to Isori and Kanon, who were peeking around to take a look, and stopped the recording shortly before the accident occurred.

“The player from Seventh High would normally decelerate at this point.”

Then proceeded to advance the recording frame by frame.

“But as everyone can see, she was actually continuing to build up speed.”

“……You’re right, that is extremely odd.”

“Indeed. A Magician who would make such a fundamental mistake has no business being in the Nine Schools Competition.”

Tatsuya nodded in agreement with Isori and Kanon’s opinions, then returned the playback to normal speed.

“I suspect that the CAD the player from Seventh High was using had been tampered with.”

The room was suffused with shock.

“This is the first major turn that requires deceleration along the entire route. If the decelerating Activation Sequence was swapped for an accelerating Activation Sequence, an accident here is unavoidable. Based on last year’s results, it is well within predictable boundaries that Watanabe-senpai and the player from Seventh High would be neck to neck at this stage. If my goal was to sabotage them, this would be the perfect opportunity to eliminate two favored candidates for First Place in one fell swoop.”

“That sounds reasonable…… But could they tamper with the CAD? And if so, when would they do that?”

“Unless there’s a traitor that snuck into Seventh High’s technician team?”

Tatsuya slightly shook his head at Isori and Kanon’s questions.

“Alas, we have no proof. Even if we petitioned Seventh High to review their CADs, they are guaranteed to rebuff us. Still, I think there’s an opportunity to do so.”

“So there really is a traitor?”

Tatsuya once more shook his head at Kanon’s speculation, but this time he was noticeably slower.

“While there’s no way to properly gauge this possibility…… I think there’s a much higher chance that there is a mole in the committee.”

His words stopped there.

Isori, Kanon, and Mikihiko were all struck speechless.

They all wore skeptical expressions.

“……But Onii-sama, assuming there is a mole on the committee, how and when would they tamper with the CADs? Each school jealously guards their own competition-use CADs……”

Miyuki would never question Tatsuya’s judgment. She was only assuming her brother’s hypothesis was true and asking for the next step in the puzzle.

Tatsuya did not reply directly, but told everyone a publicly known piece of information.

“All CADs are guaranteed to leave each school’s control and be turned over to the committee once.”

“Ah……!”

Miyuki let out a gasp since she had never thought of this. On top of that, she was the only one who gasped, since Isori, Kanon, Mikihiko, and Mizuki were all struck dumb.

“Still, there’s no way of telling what their methods are, that is the truly puzzling area……”

Just in case, they could not let down their guard even for an instant.

Miyuki and Tatsuya, the former who was about to begin her competition and the latter who was responsible for calibrating CADs, carved those words into their hearts.




For the third day, First High took First Place in both “Icicle Destruction” contests, Second Place in Men’s “Battle Board”, and Third Place in Women’s “Battle Board”.

Third High took Second Place in both “Icicle Destruction” contests as well as First Place in both “Battle Board” contests, so the two schools were much closer than the day before.

Before the competition began, Mari had told Tatsuya that the Newcomers Division shouldn’t have an impact on the final result. In this case, she appeared to be mistaken.

Tatsuya meticulously examined the CADs for the players he was responsible for and prepared for tomorrow’s Newcomers Division. It was this moment Mayumi sent a message via terminal requesting his presence.

Bewildered, he paused his work and thought “What does she need me for at this hour?”. As he headed for the conference room reserved for First High, he ran into Miyuki at the door.

“Did the President call for you too, Miyuki?”

“Yes, Onii-sama as well?”

Tatsuya initially considered that Isori and company would ask him to come and discuss countermeasures against future sabotage, but that wouldn’t explain why Miyuki had also been summoned.

“Let’s go inside.”

“Yes.”

There were some things that could only be discerned after careful thought, and some that couldn’t be discerned no matter how much one thought about it.

If pondering posed no benefit, then taking action was the way to go.

As the ancients say, pointless pondering is time wasting.

“Excuse us.”

Tatsuya didn’t want to be mired in such tiresome thoughts — likewise, he didn’t do so by any great principle, but at least he didn’t needlessly worry himself before opening the door.

Mayumi, Suzune, and Katsuto were inside — as well as Mari, who should be in bed.

“Thanks for your hard work. Are you ready for tomorrow?”

“No, I still need some time.”

“Is that so…… I’m sorry, I called Tatsuya-kun as well.”

According to Mayumi’s guilty words, the primary recipient of these words was Miyuki.

“Please, take a seat.”

The siblings did so side by side.

“There’s a small detail I would like to discuss with you two…… Sorry, it’s no small thing.

I asked the two of you to come to discuss something of vital importance.”

It seemed like it had been ages since Mayumi’s tone was so serious, causing Tatsuya to perk up a little.

“Rin-chan, can you explain?”

So she still uses “Rin-chan” even when in a serious mood, Tatsuya thought as he looked towards Suzune.

“I think you two are aware of the current standings.”

This was obviously a rhetorical question on Suzune’s part, but Tatsuya and Miyuki both nodded anyway.

“Although we ran into some unforeseen accidents, our school’s running score is roughly the same as our predictions. Unfortunately, Third High’s score is vastly greater than we anticipated, so the difference between us is a lot less than we had hoped.”

At this point, both of the siblings nodded to show that they understood.

“That being said, we still possess enough of a lead. Even if we aren’t the overall winner for the Newcomers Division, we can still claim the overall victory so long as we claim First Place for the last ‘Monolith Code’ and the score differential isn’t too large. However, if we fall too far behind Third High, then it may come down to the ‘Mirage Bat’ event from the Official Division.”

Everything that Suzune detailed were all assumptions, so was she telling them to perform well during the Newcomers Division?

If that’s all it was, there should be no need to call them at this hour…… Tatsuya was quite confused beneath his poker face.

“The point total from the Official Division is worth twice as much as the Newcomers Division, so our school’s tactical advisors have arrived at the conclusion that we should make some sacrifices in the Newcomers Division and channel our firepower into the Official Division’s ‘Mirage Bat’.”

Tatsuya’s brow twitched. He quickly read between the lines of “some sacrifices in the Newcomers Division”, thus producing minute changes in his poker face.

“Yes, Tatsuya-kun, it is exactly as you surmised.”

Mayumi adroitly read the fractional changes on Tatsuya’s face and preemptively responded.

“Miyuki-san, we ask you to replace Mari in ‘Mirage Bat’ for the Official Division. Tatsuya-kun will continue to serve as Miyuki-san’s technician and compete on the ninth day.”

Mayumi’s words clashed with her earlier words, this was no discussion.

This was a declaration of what will be done.

“But there are other senpais that are only participating in one event, so why was I chosen as a replacement knowing that this would imperil the Newcomers Division?”

Miyuki’s voice was steady, not overjoyed that she was suddenly promoted but staying cool and calm as she raised her next question.

Her reaction prompted an “Oh?” expression from Mari, even Katsuto was caught slightly off guard.

“We believe this way we can maximize our gains.”

Suzune’s voice was even calmer as she replied.

“The biggest reason is that we did not prepare a backup for ‘Mirage Bat’.”

Mari, who was originally the attending player, also joined the ranks of the persuaders.

“Even for our school’s representative players, asking them to suddenly compete in the air during the Official Division’s ‘Mirage Bat’ is still a stretch. Compared to this, we have a better chance sending a 1st Year student that has already trained for this. On top of that—”

Mari paused here for emphasis.

She was a young lady that loved to indulge in histrionics.

“Tatsuya-kun, your sister will triumph even in the Official Division, correct?”

And struck the weak spot for massive damage.

Tatsuya felt that this argument was being a little crafty, but he had no reason to be humble.

“Of course.”

“Onii-sama……”

Tatsuya’s certain answer was given as if he was stating a fact, causing Mari to break into a grin, Katsuto to nod kindly, Mayumi to widen her eyes, Suzune to shift her brows slightly, and Miyuki to duck her head in embarrassment.

“Since everyone has esteemed us so highly, I will put forth my all as an engineer. Miyuki, are you willing?”

“Y…..Yes!”

Miyuki’s beautiful back was straighter than ever as she replied to Tatsuya in an elevated voice.

This perfectly conveyed her willingness to charge into the breach.





Afterword




Firstly, allow me to deeply thank all those who actually choose to pick this book up to read.

It has been 3 months since we last met, however I am sure that there are also those [who are meeting me for the first time today], however [these kinds] of words are overly used, therefore please forgive me for using them as well.

Now that 《Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei》 volume 3 has been released into the market, and in terms of arcs its the <first> of the second arc, I must apologise for ending it at such a delicate stage, though it’s because I have tentatively set the beginning of volume 4 to be the moment when the first years (that’s the protagonist group) really start to liven things up.

The next volume will be the second arc’s <final>, rest assured that there won’t be an <intermediate>, however, conversely the thickness of the volume will be rather spectacular.

Although Dengeki Bunko (ASCII Media Works) was willing to accept any level of thicknesses, however it would not be good to do this every time and that is why from the next next volume onwards I will conduct myself better—— however, I simply cannot make such a promise, as it may be too much for me to endure.

If you are someone who only reads the afterword after actually finishing the volume, you will know that this arc’s main stage is the inter-school tournament.

Using invented magic to compete to decide a winner, to use magic skills to differentiate from each other.

Rather, other than just the representatives abilities, the technician team’s skills also largely affects the chances of victory for the whole team.

For this, perhaps even more so than ball sports or track and field meets, it is more akin to the relationship found in racing, though unfortunately the wonderful atmosphere that is usually found in World Motorcycle Championship (MotoGP) or Formula One racing (F1) is not present here.

……It’s really kind of pitiful that only now do I think of such things, however I guess I can only be contented with adding racing elements into the next Nine Schools Competition then.

For example, using sponsors or ○○ girls and et cetera, maybe the editor will use this as the type of reference materials to focus their research on (There is no such thing)

I will stop the jokes here. Perhaps some of the readers may have already realised but the story line visualised this time is really similar to a certain popular world-class novel’s fourth[2] entry.

However, the difference lies in the fact that that popular world-class novel’s fourth entry is about an individual’s competition, whereas my story is about a team competition. In addition to that, the forms of magic are completely different, therefore the competition’s circumstances is in no way similar to each other.

Speaking of similarities, I cracked my brains over (how to properly create the settings of a fictional competition), and just like a certain popular world-class novel’s…… fourth entry, maybe I should say that the whole thing is similar to Quidditch.

There are not many changes——wrong, I should say that it has already become a modern day type of a Quidditch competition.

Weirdly, the Author-sama of a certain (story) seems to not have cracked her mind about how to create such a scene, however I certainly had a headache over this. What I did manage to create is not nearly engaging and appealing enough, perhaps this is my limits as a writer.

Each of the competitions rules and regulations aren’t that difficult (there shouldn’t be any……), I hope that all of you will use a light and relaxed mood to [appreciate] the vigorous actions of the students from the Magic High Schools.

In the next volume “Nine Schools Competition (II)”, the main protagonist will finally distinguish himself in the competition. And not just in the arena, the protagonist will also have the opportunity to fully showcase his dark hero’s abilities wantonly in the outside world.

This kind of (abnormal conduct) may lead to a bipolar disposition, however I hope that you will continue to accompany me onwards in my story.

Next, this time I would also like to extend my thanks to all those who were involved in the creation of this light novel.

M-sama, thank you giving me so many precise suggestions, especially [When on a trip, of course you need to go to an onsen]. Without this suggestion, the colored illustration as well as the normal novel illustration will not be able to depict such a wonderful scene.

Ishida-sama, Stone-sama, I am sorry that I made so many demands. The two of you patiently handled all my complicated and difficult requests, and designed such beautiful and wonderful illustrations for me, and for that I really don’t know how I should thank you guys.

Especially the female protaganist’s softening smile (M-sama’s name) which caused me to sprout forbidden feelings for my own creation’s character.

Furthermore, I would also like to thank the person in charge of the illustrations’ color schemes, Suenaga-sama, as well as all the other helpers. It is all thanks to the assistance provided by everyone that an even better form of my light novel could be published.

And most importantly, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the readers who have picked up this book. It is all thanks to your support that the following volumes should also be able to be successfully published.

With that, I hope that I will be able to meet you all again in the next volume, “Nine Schools Competition (II)”.

Notes




Bokken: A bokken (木剣, bok(u), “wood”, and ken, “sword”) (or a bokutō 木刀, as they are instead called in Japan) is a Japanese wooden swordused for training. It is usually the size and shape of a katana, but is sometimes shaped like other swords, such as the wakizashi andtantō. Some ornamental bokken are decorated with mother-of-pearl work and elaborate carvings.

Bokken should not be confused with shinai, practice swords made of flexible bamboo.

Magic Eyes / Magical Appearance: Sound the same in Japanese.

Harry Potter Reference: Quite sure that this is referring to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
