“They were taken by someone else.”

“Were they that strong?”

Tatsuya’s reaction to Leo’s answer was a little different than the usual approach to this situation.

However, the detail that Tatsuya cared about the most was precisely this one.

They had been in the same class for almost a year. In Tatsuya’s eyes, the three of them had the power now to match any frontline combat Magician and maybe even the members of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.

Of course, they still couldn’t take on Kazama or Yanagi (without “Trident”, even Tatsuya couldn’t defeat them), but they could definitely hold their own against the rank and file.

“It was unfortunate that we failed, but from a strength perspective, they weren’t particularly capable opponents.”

“They did have exceptional gear. That’s the first time I ran into someone wearing a jacket that could numb an enemy on contact.”

“They also had durable armor that scattered dust on impact. If only I had had a longer weapon yesterday.”

“No wonder.”

That sort of equipment was certainly unique, but then again, that made it easier to identify the enemy.

“In the end, they even got on a black airship and fled. That was frustrating.”

“OK, we should be thankful that nothing more serious happened.”

Hearing Tatsuya’s words, or more like after hearing Tatsuya’s words, Erika couldn’t help but turn a “Hm?” look on Tatsuya.

“Tatsuya-kun, don’t tell me you already know who they are?”

“Sort of. I never made direct contact with them before, but I think I can guess.”

“Who are they?”

After considering the nature of the answer, it wouldn’t be strange that saying something and not saying something both held merit.

“JSDF Intelligence Department Counterintelligence 3rd Division. With that sort of interesting equipment and even a stealth airship for transport, it must be the 3rd Division.”

Tatsuya’s answer was very direct. Nor did there appear to be any sign he was holding back. It may be that not only Erika, but even Leo and Mikihiko had become embroiled in his affairs.

“Does…… Tatsuya know that because he’s a member of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion?”

“Ah?”

Even so,

“I don’t recall telling Erika the unit I belong to……”

At someone pointing out something they didn’t remember, Erika shook her head.

“……I see, you heard from Miyuki.”

“After seeing something like that, there’s no way I wouldn’t ask.”

The item Erika was referring to was probably the Movable Suit. Despite uncovering Tatsuya’s identity, Erika still hadn’t connected Tatsuya to the “Scorched Halloween” yet.

“Since we were engaged in full blown combat with the invading force, a clearly differentiated chain of command couldn’t be avoided. Still, I do hope you will keep that a secret.”

“I know. I don’t want to be arrested for espionage.”

Compromising the National Secrecy Act was synonymous to being suspected of spying. The majority of the citizens protested that this invasion of privacy in the latter half of the previous century, so Japan had since returned to being a normal country.

“Hey, since you know who our opponents are, you wouldn’t happen to know where they carted those guys off to, right?”

Erika’s mood rebounded quickly as she asked in a hopeful voice.

Unfortunately,

“Without knowing their objective even I can’t be sure.”

Tatsuya frankly shook his head. That was how reality was.

“True…… Our opponent is a government organization, so they must have multiple hideouts.”

“That’s because there’s a budget, though it’s not inexhaustible. Still, they’re probably like a wily rabbit that has three different hiding holes.”

Just as Mikihiko said, this time their opponent was a government organization. In terms of fighting assets at their disposal, they were on a fundamentally different level than foreign forces that had illegally invaded their soil. They had always enjoyed home field advantage, but this time that was transferred to the other side.

“Meh, it’s not like we have to worry too much. This wouldn’t have ended even if you guys had taken care of the interlopers from last night. We also know that the Parasites are onto Pixie. We just have to lay a snare that cannot be stolen from us next time.”

Tatsuya wore an evil smile as he reassured the three of them. –Despite the kind words, Erika, Leo, and Mikihiko all backed away fearfully from that expression, but Tatsuya seemed not to care.

“Let’s table this here. Lets hurry back to the classroom before we freeze here.”

Though no one present would feel that this chill would be anything serious, at the end of the day, cold was cold.

None of the three raised any objection as they followed behind Tatsuya going indoors.




Coincidentally, at the same time that Tatsuya and Erika’s group were having a chat on the rooftop, Colonel Libra also received a phone call on her end.

“I’m terribly sorry for bothering you so early in the morning, Ms. Virginia.”

“It’s you again.”

The image that appeared on the screen was the face she saw yesterday. The 15-year old young lady who claimed to be the spokesperson of the Yotsuba, Kuroba Ayako. This morning, she was still wrapped in silk and lace.

“School…… No, excuse me.”

Except while she was fulfilling her duties, Colonel Barans was pretty much a moralist. That was why she was on the verge of telling off a young girl who plainly was of the age that she should be in school but was evidently engaged in non-school related activities this morning.

“Thank you for caring.”

Keenly discerning what Virginia was thinking, Ayako revealed a perfectly polite smile.

“Still, Ms. Virginia need not worry. I have long since obtained the necessary credits to graduate.”

Since Virginia was not aware of the Japanese middle school system, there was no way for her to judge if Ayako was lying.

“No, I was the one who said something pointless. So do you have news on your end?”

Colonel Barans was only observing the forms by asking this question. She honestly was not expecting to receive any worthy intelligence on the first day.

“Indeed. Actually last night, the JSDF Intelligence Department Counterintelligence 3rd Division captured a Parasite. Right now, we have confirmed that one of them was a former Magician of the USNA military. The head told me that I should inform Ms. Virginia of this and I have done so.”

“Inform” via phone was a slight problem. Still, Barans wasn’t planning on wasting breath on that, since the information that was just provided to her far outweighed that.

“Are the Parasites on the move again?”

“Family members have reported that Parasites who have lost their vessels found new hosts. These should be the people who captured one.”

At the same time she said this, Ayako transferred encrypted documents to Colonel Barans’s terminal. After reading the table of contents for the documents that automatically decrypted themselves, she verified that one of them contained personal information with a picture attached.

“There are 3 captured Parasites. Among them, this is the only one we have currently identified. If you wish, I can also inform you of the location where they are being held captive.”

Just looking at the table of contents was not sufficient to clarify why this retired Magician was so important, but leaving him alone was not an option for Colonel Barans.

“Please do so, Ms. Kuroba.”

“Understood.”

The young lady in the picture bowed as the information was sent over. Without losing decorum, Colonel Barans gave a simple thank you before hanging up and immediately examined the documents.

Colonel Barans’s expression turned dark.

She turned towards an encrypted line specifically prepared for her and swiftly sent out a message.

The message contained orders to prepare for mobilization tonight.

The recipient of that message was Major Angelina Sirius.




The first subject of the day was General Studies. Students were allowed to read and work on problems, though some students chose to listen to music in order to enhance their studying.

Tatsuya had always allowed the text to scroll on its own, so today he brought his earphones. He would listen to the synthesized music while thinking about questions that had nothing to do with school.

It was true that he heard about the Counterintelligence 3rd Division’s name and unique features from the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.

Yet, this wasn’t like it was incomprehensible for a branch of the Intelligence Department.

Within the Intelligence Department, they were the division that had the closest relationship with the Saegusa Family. They were a detachment that had participated in this action as the hands and feet of the Saegusa Family. To be precise, they should be a unit that had mobilized with the Saegusa Family’s support in the background, which was how Tatsuya speculated this opposing force to be.

Still, this turnout felt rather surreal to Tatsuya.

He was working under the assumption that this incident happened under the Saegusa Family’s orders.

Using a stealth airship as the centerpiece to forcibly take the Parasites seemed a little too violent.

Tatsuya wasn’t that familiar with the modus operandi of the head of the Saegusa Family, Saegusa Koichi, and therefore he was unable to discern the Saegusa Family’s motives. However, if this sort of high stakes gambling was the Saegusa Family’s normal style, it would have led to a conflict with the Yotsuba Family a long time ago.

So in the end, who was it that plotted this sequence of events?

There was also the possibility that this wasn’t the will of the Saegusa Family and simply the Counterintelligence 3rd Division going rogue.

(Given that the army has disobeyed their hidden backer and acted on their own…… Then his motive must lie around some goal that is connected with the army’s existence.)

Then what is the army after?

As the violent organization dedicated to protecting the country, the army’s sole purpose was to directly meet another country’s direct overture of violence.

The nature was too complex to explain in one or two sentences.

However, from the surface, the army’s intent was glaringly obvious.

The army’s sole goal is victory. All other goals were secondary to that.

There were many paths to victory, and failing where they were supposed to fail was also a form of victory.

No matter what, everything was fine as long as they won.

Anything after winning was the business of politicians. The army only had to worry about how to seize victory.

Thus, the army would pursue power.

An intelligence unit that believed itself a cut above the norm and went rogue would undoubtedly pursue strength as its goal.

Thinking along those lines, a chill ran down Tatsuya’s spine.

It couldn’t be that the 3rd Division was trying to harness the Parasites – the demons for military purposes?

That was far too dangerous, Tatsuya couldn’t help but think.

One of the key indictments that painted Magicians in a negative light within the USNA was the accusation that Magicians summoned demons to this world. Though the agitators blamed military ambition as the reason behind summoning the demons, the slander here was obvious. However, using Parasites for martial purposes would only give more ammunition to the anti-Magician faction.

(No, the end result would be the same if the Ten Master Clans were plotting behind the scenes.)

Regardless of whether the Counterintelligence 3rd Division went rogue or were operating under orders from the Saegusa Family, Tatsuya’s renewed consideration placed them both at the same degree of risk.

A mere pup like him may have no business doing so, but a warning shot needed to be fired across the Saegusa Family’s bow.

Though this was definitely going to inconvenience Mayumi as she was preparing for a test, he really needed to find some time to talk. The moment the thought crossed his mind, he used his personal terminal to set up a meeting with Mayumi.

—Though his brain may say that this would inconvenience her, Tatsuya really didn’t care that this would make it tough for Mayumi.



After sending a message to Mayumi in the middle of class, he got a reply back within one minute. Although the message was flagged as “urgent”……

(Isn’t that person supposed to be a test taker?)

There wasn’t too much time until the test began. Though there was no danger of her failing, he still couldn’t help but think “Is this really a good idea for a test taker?”. Oh well…… Any further thought on this matter was minding someone else’s business. Since she could reply to urgent messages immediately, she must have no complaints on the matter.

After ruminating over this, Tatsuya opened the mail.

The message Tatsuya sent over was “Can I see you within the next two days to talk about something?”

Mayumi’s reply was “Come immediately to the Student Council Room.”

Even though she was able to freely come and go from school, she still came to school often.

Furthermore, her current location was not the classroom or the library, but the Student Council Room.

……Is this really a good idea? Test taker? Tatsuya thought from the bottom of his heart.



Since Tatsuya was the one who reached out for a meeting, of course he was the one who wanted to handle the situation as soon as possible, so Tatsuya was walking directly for the Student Council Room.

Though this was bona fide ditching school, cheating the monitoring system was difficult but hardly impossible.

Tatsuya used the ID card that someone he didn’t know set up for full access and opened the door. Probably because this was still class time, Mayumi was the only one in the room.

After exchanging greetings – Mayumi thought that was enough whereas Tatsuya had to consider for a moment about the right attitude – Tatsuya sat down across from Mayumi and immediately conveyed what had happened.

“……This is the situation. I think that airship belongs to the Intelligence Department Counterintelligence 3rd Division that is rumored to be connected with the Saegusa Family. As to exactly why they wanted to capture a Parasite, I have no idea. However, it is extremely dangerous if they plan to use the Parasite for military purposes. Though I do not know if they can be completely destroyed, sealing them would probably be the best bet.”

“Counterintelligence 3rd Division? Though not an adult, even I as a member of the Saegusa Family do not know about this. Tatsuya-kun, I’m amazed that you are in the know for something like this.”

“I would greatly appreciate it if you would not ask me for my sources.”

“……Well, Tatsuya-kun seems to have a lot on his plate so I won’t ask. Compared to that, can you tell me why you went after the Parasite alone?”

“I felt that if senpai’s side also sent men, they would be too wary to come.”

“Is that all there is?”

Mayumi watched Tatsuya playing dumb with a highly displeased expression on her face.

“I’ll let it go for now……”

Yet, before the completely unperturbed Tatsuya, she was about to shrug her shoulders but stopped the motion halfway.

“Tatsuya-kun wants me to try and persuade my father, correct? So that the Parasite captured by the Intelligence Department can be returned to Erika-chan and her group.”

Though this hardly mattered, at some point Mayumi started to refer to Erika as “Erika-chan”, something that would have prompted a highly unwilling look on Erika herself if she were present (Mizuki was allowed to do so, but no one else). Then again, he could never get used to Mikihiko being called “Miki”, so this must be what it means by “what goes around, comes around”.

……Tatsuya shook his head to dispel the random thoughts and replied with “I didn’t ask you guys to return it” in response to Mayumi’s question.

“I’ll be blunt. If the reason for keeping the Parasites turns out to be something other than experimentation and that their usage as military tools is discovered, hereby having a negative effect on Magicians, I will ensure that the organization responsible pays dearly for this.”

“Quite the terrifying declaration.”

Though the voice contained some degree of surprise, her gaze seemed to signify an unspeakable hatred towards that sort of talk.

“After taking into the consideration what is happening in the USNA, such a threat is necessary.”

Mayumi also knew that discrimination against Magicians was growing worse day by day over there. If a similar situation broke out in the much smaller Japan, things might turn into bloodshed at a much faster rate.

“……I understand. I will talk to my father, but I cannot guarantee anything, so please don’t be too hopeful. After all, unlike Juumonji-kun, I’m not the heir to the Saegusa Family.”

Mayumi’s last words threw Tatsuya for a loop.

“……What?”

“No…… It’s just that it’s surprising that the Saegusa Family turned out to be so patriarchal.”

“What is Tatsuya-kun’s family like?”

This may be because she was shy or simply being sulky. Tatsuya was a little unclear about the meaning behind Mayumi’s reaction.

Still, there was no reason to answer. After reflecting briefly, Tatsuya approached Mayumi’s question in a state of mind much like someone playing a penalty game.

“Our father’s influence isn’t something that is a part of our lives, since he currently moved into his second wife’s condo.”

Mayumi’s eyes started to drift all over the place.

Seeing such an innocent side of Mayumi that was so easily flustered by something like this, Tatsuya couldn’t help but think that she’s not that much older than we are. Though she often acts like an adult, she definitely couldn’t be called a “mature woman”.

“The only difference is that she’s not a lover but a second wife now.”

“How mature.”

“That’s just giving up. And if being an adult means ‘giving up’…… Then I don’t even want to think about it.”

Tatsuya answered Mayumi with a completely defeated tone.



Even a bad premonition will occasionally miscalculate.

In regards to Tatsuya’s theory about the JSDF Intelligence Department using the Parasite, that was sadly not going to happen.

Still, it was hard to say whether this constituted being “fortunate”.

The next morning.



“The Counterintelligence 3rd Division’s espionage detention center was raided. The captured Parasites have been executed.”



That was what was written on the message Mayumi passed along.





Chapter 16




—The Intelligence Bureau’s facilities were attacked, and the contained Parasites had been killed—



Tatsuya suppressed the urge to immediately contact Mayumi for a detailed report. Instead he went to the bathroom for the time being. Rinsing off the sweat from his regular training under the shower, he considered his next move.

Miyuki still hadn’t been told.

He had just come back from Yakumo’s temple. This was perfectly routine, and just because he had checked his mail before entering the shower she shouldn’t have inferred anything from it.

(No…… It’d be useless to try and hide it.)

Should he just keep quiet, Tatsuya considered, then immediately rejected the idea.

He wouldn’t be able to keep anything from his sister’s sharp intuition very long. And it would be one thing if it was completely unrelated, but Miyuki was just as involved in this matter as Tatsuya was.

Deciding to not sneak around and openly come clean with his sister, Tatsuya exited the shower.

Tatsuya’s fingers flew over the console of the workstation in the basement. If it were to be described in words, it wouldn’t be “brilliant”, but “accurate”, and “fast”, rather like his personality.

It was a Saturday, so they only had a few morning classes. But Tatsuya had considered skipping if the investigation ended up dragging out.

In that case, it would be something natural for him (he himself considered it to be “natural”).

In Miyuki’s case, it would be something natural for her, as well (to her, however, it would be more due to “necessity”), and since skipping today would have been entirely of her own free will, she had wavered until the last minute.

Fortunately, he found the data they were looking for immediately.

Although he was accessing the Defense Forces server without being authorized, the resistance of the local system (local here meaning, not standalone, but merely localized) against the hacking program made by the “Electron Sorceress” Fujibayashi Kyouko was decidedly inadequate. Compartmentalizing information in this way as a risk countermeasure meant that, whilst specific sections may be vulnerable, leaks would not impact the whole. It had both merits and demerits.

Well, since it had led to a favorable result for Tatsuya this time, he could afford to be graceful.

The video which was recorded therein contained something shocking.

Not in the sense of ruthlessness or cruelty causing a physiological impact, but that the identity of the one who had gone and caused everything had a considerable impact on the siblings.



Under the cover of darkness, a petite figure invaded.

Illuminated by the light of the alarms was a masked, flaming haired girl.

With a single glare of her golden eyes, the plain clothed soldiers were blown away, then she proceeded to carve a complicated pattern four times towards the door. As she then stepped aside, the door crashed down.

On the other side was a small room. The width was about enough to fit two single beds, and the low ceiling was 2 meters tall. On the far side were three bunk beds.

Deprived of movement, in a straitjacket, legs tightly bound, a man was lying on top of the third bed. While he looked different due to being completely pale, his face was unmistakably that of the Parasite who had identified himself as Marte.

A pale mist emitted from the girl’s mouth. It seemed the room was kept rather cold.

In her hand, the knife had been replaced by an automatic pistol.

The single shot she fired hit Marte right in the chest.

All of a sudden, the man’s body combusted.

The source of the flame had likely been the bullet. It was probably a magic which blazed on the condition the bullet stopped inside the target’s body.

The flame haired girl, Angie Sirius, fired more shots into the top and bottom beds. Clearly, this was a killing with no regard for recovering the “content”. The objective had been not merely to erase the “container”; it was an “execution”.



While watching the girl calmly walk away off the camera, Tatsuya sighed unconsciously.

He knew that Sirius’ tasks included the neutralisation of rogue magicians. He also knew perfectly well that humane treatment for magicians was all just empty talk, but he couldn’t help sighing nonetheless.

The entire affair was highly unfortunate.

Inflicting the role of a merciless killer on a 16 year old girl, just what were the USNA military brass thinking.

Even the Mafia was more considerate in their personnel selection. This was no different from religious and fundamentalist nuts who drove boys and girls to terrorism in the name of holy war.

“Onii-sama, that was…… Lina wasn’t it?”

Miyuki had been informed of Sirius’ secret, “Parade”.

She could tell from that rough image that the killer was Sirius— Lina.

“Probably.”

Miyuki seemed to be in shock, but Tatsuya could find no words to soothe her.

There was nothing he could say about the murder itself. He didn’t believe he was qualified to do any such thing. He himself had undertaken missions he could not reveal, and amongst the dirty work to be done, assassination could be said to be one of the cleaner acts.

At the same time, however, it was lonely and dismal work.

Unless there was a great compatibility in terms of personality, it would be far too heavy for a teenage girl. Unable to bear the weight, her heart would break down little by little.

And from what Tatsuya had seen, Lina was no killer.

From the voice and look Miyuki gave him, she was of the same opinion.

At this rate, there may come a time when she is lost to the darkness.

Fortunately, what happened next was further shocking enough to blow such melancholy away. All of a sudden, another figure walked into the monitor screen of the Third Counterintelligence Division’s video server Tatsuya was hacking into.

With blond hair and blue eyes, the young man appeared to be an Anglo-Saxon. He looked childish, but his age was probably around that of Tatsuya’s.

Holding her hands to her mouth Miyuki let out a sound of dismay, but Tatsuya remained calm.

This workstation had been intended for hacking, and was completely isolated from the other systems as well as running on a dedicated line. There were no mics in the room, nor cameras. Sound and visuals could only flow one way, so there was no way of observing this place from the other side of the connection.

“Hello, you can hear me right? I’ll speak on the assumption you can.”

Sure enough, the youth reflected in the monitor began to speak without attempting to establish communication.

“Let’s start off with introductions. My name is Raymond Sage Clark. One of the ‘Seven Sages’.”

Miyuki’s hands, which had at some point found their way to Tatsuya’s shoulders, tensed.

Tatsuya was aware that the sensation included tenseness of his own.

“I’ve heard about you from Tear[3]…… No, Shizuku. Nice to meet you, Tatsuya.”

It seemed this boy was a fellow student of Shizuku in her exchange.

Furthermore, someone she had provided information to.

If Shizuku’s information source had been Lina’s mentioned “sage”, it was of little wonder that even off-record information could be accessed.

But, just what was his purpose?

Going as far as to expose himself to Tatsuya.

There was always the possibility it was a video dummy, but Tatsuya’s intuition told him it was the real Raymond Sage Clark.

“Let’s speak bluntly. ……Ah, that’s a pretty nice phrase.”

Raymond was speaking Japanese. “Speak bluntly” was fluent, if not a bit incorrect. There was nothing “blunt” about his speaking anyway.

“The one who told Angie Sirius about this place was me.”

Tatsuya reflexively wanted to point out “your use of the idiom is completely wrong”, but there was no way to convey that unfortunately.

There was no doubt that “this place” referred to the Third Counterintelligence Division.

“Since before I said anything, she already knew about this place, anyway.”

The hell is that, Tatsuya thought. You’re not telling someone anything if they already knew.

Once again, there was no opportunity to retort. Tatsuya decided to see the video through to the end.

“And now, I’ve got something special for you.”

“Exclusive news” was pretty informal Japanese. It was as if he had been learning Japanese from some news room.

“I think it’s something you’ll be quite interested in. The price is my repayment to you for watching, is what I’d like to say, but since we’re wrapping up I’ll give it to you for free.”

Although Tatsuya knew he couldn’t hear, he still muttered “it’s not like I asked you” under his breath.

That was all he had time to spare for that, however.

“The anti-magician movement currently raging in the States, which is about to spill over into Japan, was orchestrated by one of the Seven Sages: Jiedo Sage Heigu.”

Being hit with this news all of a sudden, even Tatsuya couldn’t suppress his surprise.

“Jiedo Heigu, aka Gù Jié[4]. A stateless Chinese, and leader of the international terrorist organisation ‘Blanche’. The boss of that Blanche Japan branch leader whom you caught, Tsukasa.”

As the names lined up one after the other,

“He was also the previous leader of the international crime syndicate ‘No Head Dragon’, and his grandson Richard is a senior in that same group. Within the organisation he is referred to as the ‘Black Sage’, or ‘Lord Heigu[5]’.”

Tatsuya was transfixed to the screen.

“Ah, so you know, just because we’re both Sages doesn’t mean we have any connection to each other. The Seven Sages isn’t the name of some group, but rather refers to the seven operators who have access to Hliðskjálf.”

It wasn’t like conversation — questions were possible, yet he willed him to hurry up.

Hliðskjálf…… He had only heard a rumor of it once. It was a rumor, no more seemingly real than an urban legend, yet it was true, apparently. Was this the same thing as that which he had heard in the rumor?

“Hliðskjálf is-”

With impeccable timing as if reading Tatsuya’s thoughts, Raymond proceeded to describe it.

“An additional extension of the global observation system ‘Echelon III’. It’s a backdoor into Echelon III, so I suppose you could think of it as a hacking tool which allows you to lurk within the system? What would you say Tatsuya?”

“What would you say” he asks, even though there wasn’t the slightest chance of an answer.

Of course Raymond was perfectly aware of that as well, so he continued without waiting for one.

“As for where Hliðskjálf itself is located, not even us operators know. It may even be that it’s simply a program, with no physical hardware to be found.”

Raymond shrugged on screen. The gesture looked like it came straight out of some anime.

“Anyway, Hliðskjálf collects information from all over the world with an efficiency surpassing Echelon III’s main system and brings it to the operators. The operators seem to be chosen by the system itself, and there seems to be no discernible selection criteria. Apparently it’s completely random.”

Raymond mimicked twirling a pipe. He was probably rather disappointed he had forgotten to bring an actual prop.

“To try and think of something they have in common, I suppose it’d be the financial security to access advanced information systems on their own? It’s not like you’d need to be a millionaire or something, in terms of Japan or the States something along the lines of the standard of living of an average middle class would be enough.”

This was completely unbelievable.

That was Tatsuya’s impression from Raymond’s explanation so far.

Just what were the creators of Hliðskjálf thinking. It was inconceivable that they were merely hackers doing this for the pleasure of it.

“Well to be honest, it’s not much of a system. Hardware wise Hliðskjálf is completely dependent on Echelon III, and it’s merely the data processing which is more efficient; it can’t access data which is in storage since it’s merely an interception system. By the way, there’s a system guard in place which prevents saving any of the results to some external storage. The information which can be obtained is limited by the brain of the operator. At best, it’s something which grants information gathering capabilities, and allows its operators to take the name of ‘Sage’.”

Even with just that though, it was a serious threat.

It could be said now that all data of importance was moved through a network of some kind.

Just, what data was there which wasn’t communicated at least once.

“Not to mention, using Hliðskjálf poses a risk to its operators. In order to streamline the search, Hliðskjálf uses two agents: Huginn and Muninn. The search history of the operator is recorded in Muninn. Anything one operator searches for will be known to all the other operators. The reason I know of Jiedo Heigu is due to Muninn.”

At this point, Tatsuya thought “Oh my”. Theoretically speaking, that would mean it was possible the identity of Raymond Clark was known to Jiedo Heigu as well.

“Due to the loss of the Japanese branches of both Blanche and No Head Dragon, Heigu lost the means to meddle with Japan. The reason Heigu sent the Parasites to Japan was to cause an escalating turmoil, under cover of which he could rebuild his bases of operations.”

In the video, Raymond had dropped his performance. It seemed this was a serious matter to him.

“I have come to the conclusion that his aim is the elimination of magic from society. If he can push out magic technology, magically underdeveloped countries like the Great Asian Alliance can even the balance of military power at a stretch. They would be dominant in a non-magical world, and I believe that is what Heigu and those who are behind him are plotting.”





Although seemingly overdramatic, Tatsuya concluded it was logical as a whole. It had been Tatsuya’s own feeling that the Great Asian Alliance seemed to want to eradicate magic technology.

“That is not a world I desire. ……It’s fine if you laugh and call me a romanticist, but I truly believe that magic is something which will lead to the advancement of mankind.”

Although he knew there was no way the other side could hear, Tatsuya couldn’t help a spit-take. Somehow, a fundamental part of the boy just didn’t seem to match with that opinion.

“And so, from here on out, I’ll try and continue providing information you may find necessary. Tatsuya Shiba — Strategic Class Magician, God of Destruction, ‘The Destroy’.”

At that exaggerated nickname Raymond bestowed upon him, Tatsuya frowned with all his might.

—Don’t give me a name that sounds like the boss of some crappy video game. Was it possible that this boy was an “otaku” of universal language.

“We may have gone juust a bit over time. To summarize, for this matter I will offer my help in the destruction of the Parasites.”

Hardly just a bit, Tatsuya thought, but the monitor didn’t switch off.

“About the information on Jiedo Heigu. It’s up to you if you’ll believe it or not. Whether you’ll trust what I’m about to tell you right now is up to you as well. If you do however, I’d like you to repay me by completing a few tasks.”

For a moment, Raymond was silent. Not in the sense of dramaticism, but more likely due to tension, from what was reflected in the screen.

“Tomorrow, the night of February 19th your time, all active Parasites will be drawn to the back outdoor training grounds of First High. I’d like you to destroy them there.”

No evidence had been presented, but by this stage Tatsuya was already prepared to take Raymond up on his offer.

“You should note that I’ve already relayed this information to Angie Sirius as well. Whether to cooperate or not, is once again all up to you.”

He wasn’t particularly thrilled about this gesture of consideration, but unfortunately there wasn’t exactly any way to object either.

Raymond spoke no further, then the monitor suddenly went dark.

An exhalation was heard overhead.

Miyuki appeared to have been holding her breath.

Tatsuya had been too.

“Seems that we’d better leave soon if we don’t want to be late.”

Rising and looking back, Tatsuya called Miyuki along.




Year 1 Class E’s 2pm class was practical.

Although it was called a class, as usual there was no teacher present. Students just operated their CADs on their own following guidance shown on the wall monitors. The students themselves were already familiar with this, and there was now an ease due to being free from a teacher’s eyes. Of course there were those who simply gave up; whether one did so or continued persevering was up to the individual.

Most of the boys kept it up.

In order to keep from raising any attention Leo, who was delayed in arriving to the practice room, looked around and, seeing the figures of Mikihiko, Erika, and Mizuki, he proceeded inside.

“……You’re late, Leo.”

“Quiet you.”

While Mikihiko’s voice had softened considerably as of late, his reproof contained a hint of sharpness; Leo responded with a fearless grin.

That grin soon switched to an “oh?” expression.

“What about Tatsuya?”

To his inquiry, Mizuki replied “It seems he has a visitor?”

Her tone was rather questioning since Mizuki was unsure as well.

“Visitor? At school?”

As Leo echoed with raised eyebrows, Mizuki could only return a vague smile.

“More importantly, let’s get this over with.”

Erika spoke up from the side in a carefree voice. Discernible underneath her indifferent tone was a warning not to step into private matters.

“You’re right. Today’s task seems like it’ll be quite challenging.”

Saying so, Mikihiko began setting his CAD. Erika considered it someone else’s business, Mizuki was slightly anxious, and Leo felt a slight twinge; their smiles each contained their own respective feelings.



Meanwhile Tatsuya, with his moody pokerface, was sitting on a sofa in the drawing room.

Across from him sat a middle-aged man in a luxury suit. His expression was plain moody.

As these two displeased visages faced each other, it was unlikely either would attempt a conversation.

The one who ran out of patience first, having being forcibly called out of class, was Tatsuya.

“Aoki-san, would you please state your business?”

His tone couldn’t be said to be polite, nevermind his wording; the temper evident in Aoki’s face seemed to step up a notch.

Aoki as well, since it was Tatsuya, couldn’t help letting his feelings show. As the one who dealt with the underground economy and guarded the Yotsuba treasury for over ten years, Aoki’s mask shouldn’t have a single crack, nevermind going as far as to impair his speech.

Aoki should have known more than anyone how letting his emotions out like this would impair his mission. But the hierarchy of the Yotsuba had been too deeply ingrained into him,

Such consciousness had turned no few people into idiots.

“……I’m in the middle of class at the moment, so if there’s nothing important I will excuse myself.”

“Wait.”

At Tatsuya’s ultimatum, Aoki finally opened his mouth. Considerably reluctantly too.

“The other day, you purchased a 3H-P94, did you not?”

The business-like way of speaking Aoki adopted was understandable. Tatsuya found it humorous, but didn’t laugh. Such petty retaliation was, in all likelihood, just his way of coping.

“To be exact, it was the day before yesterday.”

In the same way, Tatsuya responded in a business-like manner. Unfortunately, his resolve would be lost almost immediately.

“The madam wants it. We’ll reimburse you twice the amount, so please hand it over immediately.”

Tatsuya rapidly stood up, and confirmed with a sharp gaze there were no eavesdroppers.

Since there was always equipment for the observation of magical power in magic high schools he could not use his “Eyes” freely, but his naked eyes were also trained for such a feat. In any case, there had been no one listening in to their talk.

Tatsuya took out from his pocket his mobile terminal, and connected a cable into it, holding out the other end to Aoki.

Thinking about it — no, even if you didn’t this was pretty presumptuous behavior, but realizing Tatsuya wasn’t about to say anything, Aoki with a frown nonetheless took the cable and plugged it into his own terminal.

“Aoki-san, are you sick?”

The first message he sent over was this unexpected thing.

Aoki’s reflexive reaction was to get angry, but sensing the unusual pressure emitting from the other side he inadvertently kept himself under control.

“Today is a Saturday. If you had waited just four more hours you could have called me somewhere with no people. Why would you run the risk of discussing House matters in the drawing room of a public school? I’m sure you know it’s an order from my Aunt that my links with the family are to be kept absolutely secret.”

Large cracks began to appear in Aoki’s mask of calm. The edge of his lips was trembling finely. His complexion was also pale.

Tatsuya knew there must have been reasons for such carelessness. Avoiding places Miyuki would be, preserving hierarchy, all could account for such unreasonableness.

Aoki should have realized Tatsuya would see through all that. And yet, the movement of his pen as he wrote a reply was the only answer.

“I would just like to carry out madam’s orders as soon as possible. More importantly, please bring out the 3H right now. I can leave straight after.”

“There’s no way I can do that. Even if I transferred ownership to you, the loan agreement with First High would still be in effect. The reason I bought the 3H-P94 in the first place was to prevent it from being taken away by a third party. I will take responsibility for it myself. Please tell Aunt that.”

Aoki’s face shifted from red to blue. This generally signaled an incoming tantrum.

“Are you going to disobey your orders?”

At Tatsuya’s stinging words however, Aoki deflated.

Seeing this change in him, Tatsuya stood up. He judged that there was no longer any reason for him to remain.

“Wait. No, please wait.”

It seemed Aoki didn’t intend to leave just yet.

Looking closely, the arrogance, which had earlier filled his face, no, his entire body had disappeared. Tatsuya didn’t think for a moment he was having some sort of existential revelation. Looking in his eyes however, his attitude had completely changed.

“I apologise sincerely for my conduct earlier.”

Saying so, Aoki bowed low to Tatsuya. He was still seated on the couch, but there was no misunderstanding that he really was apologising.

“Please raise your head, Aoki-san.”

As he spoke, Tatsuya returned to his seat. It didn’t mean he was responding to Aoki’s sincerity. In the first place, Tatsuya didn’t feel much sincerity at all. However, he was interested in what Aoki had to say which would cause him to become so serious.

“Tatsuya-kun, rather, Tatsuya-dono, it’s exactly as you say. Since the loan agreement was a prerequisite for the purchase, it stands to reason that you cannot just take it away. I’m sorry for asking something so unreasonable.”

“It’s fine.”

As Aoki bowed again, Tatsuya inclined his head to match. He replied with just that because what Aoki had stated was so obvious, anything he said could end up being construed as sarcasm. In any case, the fact that he didn’t consider it a problem anymore seemed to have been conveyed to Aoki, who raised his head without prompting this time.

“I would just like you to understand this. Madam isn’t asking for your 3H because she’s taken some fancy to it. It seems she thinks it’d be necessary for some kind of research.”

“I understand.”

“I won’t impose on you any further. Again, I realize you must feel the need to keep that near at hand. If at any point you feel like letting go of it however, please consider handing it over to madam. In that case, I will of course provide appropriate compensation.”

It wasn’t hard reading the lines behind Aoki’s proposal. It seemed whatever the case, his Aunt didn’t want Pixie falling into someone else’s hands.

“If you’re willing to accept, we will be happy to provide the promised amount, plus an additional 10% of what you spend every year.”

“Every year?”

He didn’t think they’d go this far. It was still only a drop in the bucket for the Yotsuba, but from global rates it was a princely sum.

“Yes, every year. Specifically, we would like to make a contractual conditional purchase reservation with you which automatically renews every year.”

Not just a verbal promise, but even a contract. Both to Tatsuya, and the Yotsuba, 10% of the purchase amount was peanuts. The purpose of the contract then was more for Tatsuya to keep his end of the bargain.

In other words, claiming ownership. It was an offer behind which the seriousness of the Yotsuba — of Maya could be glimpsed.

“As I’m sure you know, I’m still a minor.”

“I will relay things to your father.”

Meaning that Aoki would sort through the legal details himself.

“Got it. I don’t mind.”

There was no disadvantage in Aoki’s proposal for Tatsuya. Rather than further harming his image in the view of his obstinate Aunt, it’d be better to make a compromise here, Tatsuya thought.




Having accompanied Aoki all the way to the entrance, Tatsuya went back to the practice rooms. Although half of the two hour class had passed already, he felt that he should still be able to make attendance.

His feet stopped however before he entered the corridor.

“Lina.”

The face of the transfer student, whom he hadn’t seen for a while, was notably worse for wear. There were no physical cues such as gaunt cheeks or bags under the eyes visible. It was impossible to find any sign of adverse health.

But her luster was gone. She was holding on to her usual act, and someone who knew little about her would have been fooled yet by her utterly gorgeous looks. But someone who was familiar with her — even if only to Tatsuya’s degree — would notice the absence of the overflowing spirit which had truly made her shine, and the difference was palpable.

It seemed the mental fatigue was stacking up.

She must be under immense pressure.

Now however the shadows added a frail transience to her beauty, and increased her charm in a different way from usual. Even Tatsuya who normally took little interest in a girl’s appearance — or rather, was utterly accustomed to them, couldn’t help but feel admiration.

“Tatsuya.”

Nonetheless, it wasn’t to the point his reactions were delayed.

At his name being called, he adjusted his gaze to look into those sapphire eyes.

“Did you hear?”

“Yeah.”

They were talking about the information obtained from the Sage. The one which said that tomorrow night, the Parasites would be led to the outdoor training grounds in the back. Their words were brief, but the intent was fully received by both of them.

“Do you know who it was?”

“No.”

So it appeared he had not shown Lina his face, Tatsuya inferred from that answer. It made sense. If the USNA army became aware of the Sage’s identity, they would stop at nothing to hunt down that veritable fount of knowledge.

“I see, that’s a pity.”

“I suppose. Not that it matters.”

Cutting to the chase, Lina looked at Tatsuya with challenging eyes.

“Tatsuya.”

Firm and bright.

A gaze with as strong a will as that night they were killing each other.

“I will not hold back.”

He already knew, but Tatsuya found himself realizing again. Regardless of his own preference, an alliance had not been an option from the very beginning.

“I know. The worlds we live in are completely separate after all.”

Tatsuya’s answer was a classic (old fashioned) line often found in romance novels (or movies), synonymous with a farewell.

The reason he chose such an easily misunderstood line was because of those secretly listening in.

Lina visibly swallowed her retort. With just a little delay, she seemed to have noticed Tatsuya’s intention.

Some color however had returned to Lina’s pale complexion. Somehow, Tatsuya felt that the red now dying her cheeks held a different meaning from before.

“Such an idiot!”

Spitting those words out, she spun around on her heels,

And it was impossible to tell whether she was simply playing along with Tatsuya’s act,

Or if those had been Lina’s true feelings.

Tatsuya was clear of one thing now however.

—With a sigh of acceptance, he resigned himself to a detention practical after school.




Yotsuba main house.

As Hayama served afternoon tea, an electronic sound denoted an incoming call. Seeing Maya’s nod, Hayama picked up the classic voice communication terminal and pressed it to his ear.

“Aoki. ……So, you failed. ……It is a fact it seems you were unable to carry out Madam’s orders. Well, such circumstances cannot be helped. ……I do not believe there is any hurry. Tatsuya-dono is unlikely to change his agreement over something of this degree. ……Very well. I shall inform Madam. ……Good work.”

“……What news from Aoki-san?”

After Hayama set down the terminal, Maya asked. With a look of not wishing to have to convey unpleasant news, Hayama bowed to Maya.

“Apologies, Madam. We were unable to procure the 3H.”

The failure had been Aoki’s. But as the head butler, Hayama could be said to be Aoki’s superior. Aoki’s bungle was his shame to bear.

Maya’s answer held neither forgiveness nor reproach.

“Tatsuya-san’s name had come up.”

What she took interest in was this point.

“Tatsuya-dono had purchased the 3H.”

As Hayama answered, a wry smile appeared on his face.

“Apparently Tatsuya-dono did not wish for it to fall into the hands of others. He has entered into an ownership lend-lease agreement with First High.”

Still, that had been the next best alternative had Maya not been able to get ahold of Pixie itself.

“……I wonder if he knew. Or was it just coincidence?”

“I do not know.”

Maya’s expression was slightly puzzled. But she immediately cleared her mind.

“……Well, if Tatsuya-san can take good care of it I don’t mind.”

“Aoki has said that if Tatsuya-dono ever decides to let go of it, we are contracted to purchase it.”

“Yes, that would be good.”

Hayama faced Maya and bowed lightly. Although Maya had not blamed Aoki, much less Hayama from the beginning, he nonetheless showed his gratitude for her leniency towards the mismanagement.

“Still, it really would have been nice to have a sample on hand……”

At Maya’s mutter Hayama, with a look suggesting “we should just leave things be” spoke up.

“Madam, I’m sure there is no need for me to say this, but it’s best to have as little as possible to do with those creatures.”

Maya’s ironic smile was a reminder she was lovely still.

“Because they’re rather distasteful?”

“As you will.”

“They’re very important sponsors after all.”

At Maya’s sly smile, Hayama frowned.

“I know what you want to say, Hayama-san. I have no intention of causing discord. I only do this because I believe that obtaining a ‘Parasite’ is necessary for the Yotsuba.”

“Does Madam believe then that studying the Parasite will bring us closer to the mysteries of Mental Interference?”

“Yes. ‘Just what exactly is the mind’ is a question the Yotsuba have been endlessly pursuing. It’s said that the Parasites are individual mental information bodies. Information on substance, structure, location…… Even if only a little, it should give us hints as to the true nature of the mind.”

Understanding Maya’s reasoning, Hayama bowed.

Maya returned to the original topic.

“By the way, what are the movements of the other spirits?”

“According to the report from Kuroba-dono earlier, the spirits which were purged yesterday night have already been resurrected.”

“Already? That’s quite early.”

“There must have been a reason for the rush. Kuroba reported it seemed the spirits were preparing for battle.”

“I see…… Any idea about whom against?”

Floating on Maya’s face as she queried Hayama was a barely repressed smile.

“Judging from their modus operandi, they will be aiming for their compatriot trapped in the doll.”

“At this point it’s not so much that trouble finds him, but almost as though he goes after trouble himself.”

Needless to say, Maya’s words referred to her nephew. The person in question would no doubt violently protest that, but here there was no one who voiced dissent.

“Do you know when it will happen?”

“Kuroba-dono anticipates it will be tomorrow night, around First High school.”

“It would still be prudent to keep an eye on the surroundings then…… All right, please organise a group. The leader can be…… Ayako-chan should be fine. The goal isn’t a fight after all.”

“Certainly.”

Hayama clapped his hands, calling for a maid to serve Maya in his place, before heading towards the communications room to relay Maya’s orders.




Although it was not a relatively late hour, Saegusa Mayumi was an examinee.

Today was February 18th, Saturday. One more week until the entrance exams for magic university. Her chances of not making it were practically zero, yet nonetheless it was a fact she had little time for much else.

That the “vampire incidents” had seemingly subsided for now was good news for her mental state.

Making up on her weak areas in the school library, by the time she returned home the day had almost passed.

Being welcomed back by a slightly timid young servant, Mayumi immediately noticed.

“Is Father back?”

“Yes, m’lady.”

Being well trained the maid didn’t fumble her words or the like, but Mayumi could perceive that what had frightened her was her father.

(To scare a young girl like this…… Father, just what are you doing?)

Although she felt irritation in her heart, to display it would only disturb the staff more.

“Alright.”

Mayumi smiled at the maid, then proceeded to her own room.



At that time in his study, the household head Saegusa Koichi turned a face filled with ill-concerned frustration to his confidant Nakura.

“……So you’re saying the one who invaded and killed the Parasite the Third Counterintel division had captured was the Stars’ Sirius?”

“There is little doubt.”

In the face of his master’s anger, there was no trace of fear in Nakura’s face. While he was courteous, unlike the interactions between Hayama and Maya, there was a business-like aspect to be found. Nakura was not a family member of the Saegusa, and would be more aptly described as a mercenary. He was not inextricably bound to Koichi’s side.

Sometimes he was assigned as a guard for children, such as with Mayumi, or sometimes sent to accomplish missions which lay outside the law such as intel gathering. That was how he was treated by Koichi, as an Extra number.

“But even for the Stars’ Sirius, for them to simply waltz in and kill the prisoner so easily is too much. The Intel division wasn’t slacking off either. Could your source have been mistaken?”

As Koichi spoke with disgust, Nakura calmly rebutted.

“The Intel division of the defence forces is by no means incompetent. Had we been the ones to attempt an infiltration of the Third Counterintel division’s building, we would not have found the security to be lacking. Rather, it’s simply that the Stars are just that good. There’s a reason they’re known as the most powerful force of magicians in the world to date.”

Being spoken to as if being chided as a child, Koichi’s expression became increasingly sullen. Not to the point of losing it and yelling at Nakura however.

“Sir, if I may be so bold, I believe it’s time we cut our losses. The benefits of the Saegusa’s continued involvement in this diminish by the day.”

“……You’re right.”

Koichi calmly considered Nakura’s calm advice.

“It seems the Kudou are also moving in this matter. I had considered asking them to supplement our depleted forces, but pulling out may be for the best.”

“As you say.”

“Tell our dispatched members to return to their normal duties. Nakura, dismissed.”

“Excuse me.”

As Koichi began operating an encrypted communication terminal by himself, Nakura left the study.




AD 2096, February 19th, Sunday.

Eight Parasites would be moving. Tatsuya did not unilaterally trust this information from across the sea.

He had endlessly researched regarding a boy named Raymond Clark amongst the students in Shizuku’s exchange school.

The face on the photo stored in the school server was the same as that which had appeared in the video.

But that alone did not guarantee Raymond Clark was telling the truth. Just as you would not dismiss all anonymously supplied information as false, you wouldn’t trust all information just because it had been supplied by someone who gave their true identity.

Nonetheless Tatsuya had gone over to the specified location--the outdoor training field of First High. This was because he had no other significant leads.

He waited, leaving things in the hands of chance. Even if it ended up being false and he wasted the day, it wasn’t a big deal.

In the exceptionally large grounds behind the school was an artificial forest. Technically it was also part of First High, but it was difficult to tell where the artificial forest came to an end and the natural forest began. Especially so at night.

The time was nearly 7pm. Maybe it didn’t quite qualify as night yet.

Unlike in the inner city however where bright lights eclipsed the darkness, in this forest with no street lamps in sight it wouldn’t be wrong to think it was nearing nightfall.

To prevent trespassers entering by mistake, a high fence surrounded the training grounds. If a normal citizen wandered in and was hit by magic shot during training, it would be all kinds of problematic.

However, even without the fence, it was unlikely any locals would enter. It was well known in the neighbourhood that this was the practice field of First High.

Besides, there were no households around unrelated to the magic high school. When First High had been established here, the government had offered compensation for residence transfer to all those who were unrelated to magic, who couldn’t use magic, or who wanted nothing to do with magic. All those who remained knew very well the risk of setting foot in that field.

That was also why there was no particular security system. There was nothing to steal considering it was just an artificial forest, so there was no pressing need to keep out intruders.

“Can you get over it?”

Looking up at the three meter high fence, Tatsuya asked his companions. The only direct entrance in was a back gate from First High, so having exited the school the only way in was scaling the fence. Entering from outside was simple, but entering from inside would require dealing with the school’s difficult to deceive monitoring system. While systems were of course in place to detect thieves entering from the training grounds, if suspicious people entered not only from outside but inside as well there would be far more cause to investigate.

“Of course, Onii-sama.”

“No problem.”

“Something like this’ll be a piece of cake!”

At Tatsuya’s words Miyuki, Erika and Leo replied in the affirmative.

“It is possible.”

Last of all, the one to whom the question had originally been posed to, Pixie, answered.

Tatsuya’s companions tonight were these three, and one doll. —Originally, Tatsuya had not planned on bringing Miyuki. Erika as well, since she had been involved thus far, had only been supposed to be informed of events.

But he knew that knowing about such events, there was no way they’d simply wait quietly at home. When leaving, Miyuki had tagged along as if it were only natural, and at the specified time Erika had casually just turned up; at both these times Tatsuya had not protested. He knew that resistance would only be a pointless exercise in futility. Rather he had given up, and immediately set about incorporating his friends into his strategy.

Turning his focus to the training grounds again, he felt the air of the forest stir. The other players seemed to have ascended to the stage already.

Whilst pretending to operate his CAD — he didn’t forget to maintain confidentiality at this stage — he pulled the sequence for “Leap” from his memory and jumped over the fence.



Amongst the shadows of the forest, the four + one moved as a single entity. They did not spread out to search for the target. In an area of this size, in this darkness, separating would have little benefit and only run the risk of them being defeated individually.

Even if that hadn’t been the case, it had been proven in Aoyama that regrouping under such circumstances would be an arduous task. It wasn’t impossible that the opponents wouldn’t be coming out on alert, but even so there was no sense risking it. If they couldn’t find the Parasites like this, they would simply come back tomorrow and search steadily again.

Not to mention, Tatsuya had the feeling that they would appear.

It was not a prediction.

Nor an inference.

Although he had no basis, Tatsuya was certain as he clove through the trees. The light of their torches only illuminated a small part of the ground, but there was no one who stumbled amidst the dead branches and tree roots. Possibly because there were no new tracks, whilst straining their eyes they simply proceeded on at the same pace as if it were day, for about 15 minutes.

“Tatsuya-san, please stop.”

From the communications device fitted to his ear, the voice of Mizuki came through. In conference mode, the words reached all of their headsets.

“38 degrees to the right of your current direction, I can see the aura of Parasites.”

Instead of accompanying Tatsuya and the others, Mizuki was on a rooftop overlooking the training grounds providing navigation with her “eyes”.

“I see them too! Two men and a woman, three in total.”

Using the aura Mizuki had spotted, Honoka’s magic applied to a camera activated. The image aquired via optical magic was as clear as those taken from close range in broad daylight, and was delivered to the group’s terminals via wireless.

If not for the unique talents Mizuki and Honoka possessed as magicians, a search scheme of this type would be impossible. Having determined that their utility was indispensable to the mission tonight, Mikihiko had been assigned as an escort for the two. Mikihiko himself had not been unhappy with this placement. He understood full well how important his role was, and knew that he was perfectly suited for the job.

“Ah! From the opposite direction, a masked girl is approaching the Parasites!”

Honoka’s report rang in. With the Parasite’s aura becoming visible, it seemed Lina had sprung the attack.

Tatsuya signalled with his hands. Miyuki, Erika, Leo, and Pixie nodded.

The next moment, Tatsuya became a gale blazing through the forest.

Erika followed right behind him whilst Leo, checking side to side, started running with Miyuki and Pixie.




Tatsuya’s group, the band of Parasites, as well as Lina and her backup team.

Gathered in this forest right now were these three forces, both Tatsuya and Lina thought.

Tatsuya knew that there was a faction in the defense forces who wished to capture a Parasite, but he recognised they were under the influence of the Saegusa. Being warned through Mayumi, with the Yotsuba undoubtedly moving to keep them in check and having received a large blow from “Angie Sirius”, Tatsuya determined that they should be in pretty bad shape. At least, they would be in no condition to interfere tonight.

In fact, however, under the shade of the trees, a different group approached both Tatsuya and Lina.

They were a guerrilla infantry platoon of the defense forces First division, specialising in close combat, known as the “Sword Corps”. As the name implied they did not use firearms, but were a group which launched surprise attacks using sword type devices.

Their mobilisation was due to a range of circumstances, what with Tokyo being under the First division’s jurisdiction, the nature of the mission requiring covert action, as well as them being under the influence of the Kudou. No, that last reason may have been the biggest of all.

Tatsuya was not omniscient. Something unknown couldn’t be calculated for, and naturally the wrong response would result. That the Kudou elder would be interested in the Parasites as weapons, and that he could assemble a force in only three days, was not something he could have have known.

And furthermore, there was another. Rather, one more person.

One shadow, tracking the Sword Corps.

Now, within the training grounds of First High, these five powers raced towards their inevitable collision.




As the Stars captain “Sirius”, the mission must be fulfilled.

Underpinning Lina now was this pride alone.

It wasn’t as if she had known no setbacks before coming to Japan. In the juvenile education program provided by the Pentagon, she had gotten only Cs in algebra and biology. In the combat class, within the same group, there were monstrously developed female soldiers of the same age who she just couldn’t seem to beat. She had not done well in pilot training either.

But she had never once lost in magic.

The captain of Stars, Angie Sirius.

One of the most powerful magicians in the world.

Everyone had praised her, and she had supreme confidence in her skills herself.

But here in Japan.

She had lost to those siblings.

The first battle had been of her choosing.

Having withdrawn in her own time, it had been a “successful retreat”.

The second time she had faltered in the face of Tatsuya’s “kamikaze” attack, and though she had lost to the ambush, even though strategically she was defeated she had not been bested by magic.

In the single combat with Miyuki which followed however, it was her defeat.

In spite of the adverse conditions, Lina did not think of them as an excuse.

In a head on clash, she had lost to Miyuki.

That defeat had further spurred her fighting spirit.

Unfazed, she had vowed vindication.

However,

In that fight for redemption,

Lina had been hammered by Tatsuya.

Luring him out into a one-on-one, even going as far as to pull out “Brionac”, she had still lost.

Even as she felt chagrin towards him, there was neither enmity nor resentment. Where Tatsuya had put Lina to shame was not in the speed of her restraint.

The fight itself had been very fair. Rather, she had the advantage.

She had lost to Tatsuya not just in terms of magic skill, but also in conviction…… Lina accepted that.

But without a doubt, that defeat had shaken her to the core. She was one of the most powerful combat magicians in the world, Sirius.

Therefore she had been selected as the captain of Stars, the position which cared neither for age nor gender but was given to the USNA’s strongest based on power alone. In the case said magician wasn’t in the army, even if plotting and subterfuge was required they would be conscripted in as the Stars captain and “Sirius”.

The chances of those defeats leaking out to the world at large was slim. In the first place both Tatsuya and Miyuki, as well as those who had accompanied them, were keeping quiet. Tarnishing the name of Sirius was not their goal.

Yet even if nothing was known to others, she had to face the fact she lost with dignity. In order to redeem herself, Lina had to demonstrate her abilities and fulfill her duties as “Sirius”.

If she were to be able to continue as Sirius.

For the sake of the girl within her who was lost the moment she had taken the Sirius name, Angelina Shields.




When Tatsuya had closed in enough to see with his own eyes he saw Lina: masked, flaming haired and golden eyed taking on the three Parasites alone.

Although the Parasites could cast magic without the need for activation sequences, merely thinking it into being, Lina wasn’t giving an inch. In terms of attack ratio, Lina was dishing out seven blows for every three the Parasites managed to get in. If it weren’t for one of the Parasites having a dangerous ability, the battle might have been even more skewed

The ability was pseudo-teleportation.

In terms of magic, it combined complex inertial dampening and high speed movement techniques.

By using the trees for mobility, it was possible to move in three dimensions, popping up and firing off magic.

The magic attacks held low interference power, and were nothing before Lina’s magical might, yet she could not merely do nothing, and every time she raised defensive magic, some of the attacks from the other enemies would get through. Tatsuya judged the situation in an instant.

He had no intention of assisting Lina, but Tatsuya halted, and aimed “Decomposition” at the Parasite using teleportation.

Many magicians aim magic using the five senses. Even when using perceptions outside the five, their aim would be the location of the target.

That was how it was normally.

Tatsuya however could aim at the information itself. Even if the location of the target changed rapidly, as long as the information itself was recognisable the aim would not be hindered.

The pseudo-teleportation had no effect on Tatsuya.

“Leave it to me!”

That wasn’t just the case for Tatsuya however. Catching up to the now stationary Tatsuya, then passing him, Erika activated inertia control.

The pseudo-teleportation held a threat only if the opponent’s hands, feet, and above all eyes could not keep up. On the other hand, if the opponent’s speed exceeded that of the operator, such three-dimensional maneuvers were merely wasted acrobatics.

Erika grasped the Isori house-made and Tatsuya-adjusted (not that she asked him to) downsized version of “Orochimaru”, the integrated CAD armament “mizuchimaru”, and accelerated straight ahead.





Her destination was exactly where the Parasite, who had just kicked off a tree trunk, would land.

With extraordinary dynamic vision, her body control not lost even under the effect of an inertial canceling technique, her footwork propelling her forwards without any wasted motions, she was able to calculate the exact moment the opponent would hit the ground.

In terms of magic power, the Parasite was probably ahead.

But Erika’s might as a martial artist overturned the difference.

Erika swung Mizuchimaru.

Without an ounce of hesitation, the honed blade cut the Parasite down.

Tatsuya modified the aim of his partial decomposition, shooting out the limbs of another Parasite which was now aiming a telekinetic attack at Erika, and as she delivered the final blow he held out his left hand towards the fresh corpse.

Mikihiko would maintain a barrier which prevented the Parasites from exiting their hosts. He had set up a simple altar on the roof of the school building. The reason Mikihiko was positioned on the rooftop was not only to escort Mizuki and Honoka, but also because he could project remote barriers.

The effects of the barrier were imperfect however. It wasn’t a matter of Mikihiko’s skill, it was a fundamental flaw of the technique itself. Originally, barriers could not be constructed like this.

As long as the host survived, the Parasite could not flee from its vessel. In other words, once the hosts died the Parasites were free to escape. Even if they could secure the bodies, they could not contain the Parasites themselves. Before Erika fully killed the Parasite, it was necessary to process it.

A mass of psions shot from Tatsuya’s palm, and ripped the psions away from the body of the Parasite. No, a closer image would not be “ripped” but rather “scattered”.

Tatsuya, Miyuki, and Mikihiko had examined the results of previous engagements, and deduced that the Parasites were a core of Pushion information bodies with a thin layer outside; schematically speaking analogous to a fibrous layer of Psion information bodies coating a Pushion center; this led to the hypothesis that they consumed Psions whenever they used magic.

Destroying the Pushion body itself was difficult for Tatsuya. That had been proven twice now.

He had discovered, however, that he could cripple them.

And while Mikihiko would have difficulties sealing a Parasite alone, when stripped of magical resistance and weakened it was a different story.

“Mikihiko!”

Tatsuya called out into the hands-free headset. It wasn’t necessary. Thanks to Honoka’s optical magic and Mizuki’s “eyes”, Mikihiko was already fully aware of the events transpiring in the field.

Mikihiko “seeing” what was happening, and calling down a bolt of lightning from the heavens, was almost simultaneous with Tatsuya’s call. The lightning struck the dead body of the host, and seared the skin black. Remaining carved on the skin were a series of characters and regular geometrical patterns.

“Nice shot!”

Erika shouted out with delight. In Tatsuya’s sight, no information was leaking from the host body.

However, he didn’t share Erika’s joy just yet.

He fired more shots at the Parasite he had disabled.

The body of the host, left to its biological responses, was flailing around wildly.

Another flash of sealing retribution struck down. The body, hit by Tatsuya’s Psion bullets, stopped moving. That made two Parasites sealed.

At the edge of his vision, different thunder roared. Rather than Ancient lightning, it was a blitz of modern magic.

He saw a body charred by Lina’s magic. It was probably already just an empty shell.

“One escaped. Mizuki, do you have it?”

“I’m sorry, keeping track of everything from here is……”

When he reflexively inquired into the headset, the answering tone was apologetic. Thinking about it, this was natural; as Mizuki’s vision couldn’t extend to that which she couldn’t physically see, she couldn’t enlarge and view distant objects.

“I see. Sorry, I asked something unreasonable. Don’t mind it.”

Following up to Mizuki, Tatsuya turned to Lina and Erika with a bitter look.

“Angie Sirius.”

That she was upset behind her mask was not an illusion of Tatsuya’s.

“What.”

But this time, she seemed willing to talk. Her voice had changed as well, was this another effect of “Parade”?

“Try not to kill them until they’re sealed. The cleanup will be troublesome.”

She was momentarily at a loss for words. She intuitively understood that Tatsuya hadn’t said “troublesome” simply to look bad; he truly did simply view a person’s life and death as a “hassle”. —Not that it changed Lina’s answer.

“It’s not my problem. I am merely here for the deserters.”

While she had consciously changed her tone, it was still possible to tell from her intonation, Tatsuya thought.

Of course, what he said was completely different.

“The duty of Sirius is it……well, that’s why we want to seal the bodies. One’s escaped.”

“That is not included in my mission.”

Stubborn as ever. And negotiating with someone unwilling to listen had never been Tatsuya’s strong point. His stance had always been “if you don’t want to listen then fine do what you like, and so will I”. However, he had to get her to listen in this case. Tatsuya persevered as he suppressed the urge to heave a sigh.

“Mission you say, but the one you killed just now seems like an Asian born and bred. Was he really a deserter?”

Tatsuya wasn’t completely certain that wasn’t the case. It was a bluff really. But Lina was clearly upset. His guess appeared to have hit the mark.

“……Even if not a deserter, he was guilty of aiding them.”

Yet even now, her stubbornness refused to relent.

“I’ll say it again, the Parasites are no concern of mine. All I’m here for is to fulfill my role as Sirius.”

Saying so, Lina disappeared into the forest.

Holding back an urge to shrug, Tatsuya turned to Erika.

“So she came out, that Sirius.”

Erika came leaping over. Knowing that she smiled without holding a grudge over the events of three days ago, Tatsuya could only smile wryly in turn.

After her grin of triumph passed, the smile vanished,

“That was……Lina wasn’t it? Although she looked completely different.”

And Erika asked with a straight face.

“If she looked completely different, why would you think so?”

“Her actions, I guess. The way she moved and carried herself, it’s all so familiar.”

“Good point……”

Tatsuya had to acknowledge Erika’s powers of observation. The illusory magic “Parade” which changed everything from face to build had been seen through by something so trivial.

Still, he couldn’t be stuck in admiration forever.

“I think you understand already, but keep it a secret. That being said, I’d like to apply what I said to Lina to you as well.”

“Don’t kill em?”

“Yes. You heard the explanation. As long as the host doesn’t die, the Parasites cannot escape from within them. We put up a barrier to prevent escape, but neutralising without killing is still the best way to make sure.”

Tatsuya’s request was reasonable. Erika understood that.

“I’m sorry. It’s unfair on you Tatsuya-kun, but I can’t do that.”

However, Erika — Erika shook her head.

“One who is prepared to kill by the sword, must also be prepared to be killed. Thinking about that moment……I just can’t purposely prolong their pain without killing them.”

The reason was completely different from Lina however. It was personal, and her true feelings.

“It’d be different if they could be saved without killing them, but sealing them is the same as killing them isn’t it? So even if they’re no longer human, I want to take them down without drawing out their suffering.”

There was no nervousness in Erika’s expression, or her eyes. Her determination however was resolute.

“Guess it can’t be helped.”

Killing was an absolute to Tatsuya. Whether one was killed after being inflicted with suffering or not, the end result of being killed did not change; this was Tatsuya’s reasoning.

He didn’t try and sway Erika however. Values were an individual matter.

Some of which did not bear another’s meddling.

“Well, I’ll just have to work extra hard.”

That exterminating the Parasites would require such contradictory commitment didn’t cross Tatsuya’s mind.




Leo, chasing after Tatsuya, saw the flashes of thunder and psion light from the battle and suddenly froze. With almost no delay, Miyuki immediately stopped as well. Pixie, in the body of a machine, took a few steps to come to a halt.

“Saijou-kun, be careful.”

“That’s my line.”

Leo spoke in a joking tone, but his eyes were already sweeping left and right.

“We’re surrounded……or something. It seems like it if nothing else. I’m empty handed for now, but what should we do Miyuki-san?”

He had no far-sight or infrared perceptions. He had done no particular training either, but observing his surroundings he could vaguely make out the signs of others’ maneuvers .

“Let’s intercept.”

Miyuki’s reply was short and straightforward.

“……That’s pretty aggressive.”

Leo’s reaction wasn’t quite as enthusiastic.

“Is that so? But there’s nothing to be afraid of you know? Even if things get out of hand, Onii-sama will come over and help immediately.”

“Ah~, of course, of course.”

Her reasoning was very cute however.

His eyes narrowed as he unintentionally muttered.

“Though, I don’t want to bother Onii-sama either……”

As Miyuki debated back and forth to herself, she called out to Pixie.

“Pixie, stay behind me.”

“Yes.”

Turning towards the thicket on the left, Miyuki gave instructions. Ordered by Tatsuya to obey Miyuki, Pixie complied with minimal verbosity and moved into position.

The mobile terminal CAD in Miyuki’s left hand was already on standby. As Leo wondered just when she had reached for it, he found himself looking at her with admiring eyes once again.

To his credit, his gaze didn’t remain fixed indefinitely.

He was an “unconcerned” type, but even if not Miyuki herself would have ignored it without noticing the eyes of any save Tatsuya’s.

Her awareness was already focused on the enemy.



Miyuki’s fingers moved smoothly. The thumb of her left hand gripping the CAD danced across the force feedback panel.

There was no warning.

The air of the forest gleamed. Glittering shards of ice formed on trunks and branches and fell to the ground. It was a phenomenon known as thin ice, or diamond dust. February, inland, in a forest at night; needless to say it would normally be impossible given the conditions.

There were none who mistook it for a natural occurrence however.

It was a magic which formed an area of diamond dust in a 100 meter radius instantaneously. This was neither an offensive nor defensive magic however. Unsure of the intent of the other party, Miyuki was merely declaring her territory.

By merely forming a thin layer of interference, the weather had changed. In the Yokohama incident of October, Mari had evaluated Miyuki’s magic as “worthy of Tactical level”.

Strictly speaking, that was incorrect. Miyuki’s magic wasn’t “worthy of” tactical. It “was” tactical.

Miyuki’s magic abilities, rather than enhancing an effect, were more specialised towards suppressing an area.



—Power sufficient to, even unintentionally, dye the world white as far as the eye could see—



That was Miyuki’s magic.

In this situation, Leo was truly impatient.

To him, a fight was the means by which “talks” were resolved.

Like in Yokohama, in a situation where it was clear the opponent had no interest in words, strength would immediately become the “mediator”.

If it was the enemy who had underestimated them and come over, he would not be stingy in “correcting” them with his fists.

If it was an acquaintance in trouble, he would “lend a hand” in a rough violent manner.

It may be called “uncivilised”, but fighting had always been a staple of negotiating.

In the face of Miyuki’s power, however, nevermind their claim; the enemy’s very existence would be blown away.

Rather than a cat toying with a mouse, it would be more like an elephant crushing ants.

They would be far too pitiful to be considered opponents.

That was against Leo’s style.

“Miyuki-san, I’ll take these chumps on. Just back me up until Tatsuya arrives!”

In this darkened frozen world, a focused fighting spirit blazed forth.

There was no hostility, only willpower. No negative feelings, simply purpose.

The other party were professional fighters incomparable with typical city thugs, yet nonetheless he threw down the gauntlet before Miyuki. His mind was probably already made up.

“Oh? Then, I’ll leave things to you.”

At Leo’s words, Miyuki lightly stepped back.

The frigid air permeating the forest however lingered.

Like I’ll lose to these guys, Leo psyched up.

From the shadow of the trees and thickets, men in field uniforms wielding large knives materialised one after another.

After around ten, the newcomers ceased.

No more flashes had been seen in the direction they had been heading towards, and the din of battle was no longer audible. It seemed things had settled one way or another.

“Panzer.”

Muttering “hurry up, Tatsuya” in his mind, Leo spoke the voice command to deploy his activation sequence.

Ironically, that became the signal.

Wordlessly, soundlessly, one of the encircling soldiers sprang forth.

Fast! Leo barely had time to think before the knife thrust.

He repelled it with his left arm.

Both Leo and the soldier were startled.

Yet neither of them lost a beat.

The soldier’s free left hand shot towards Leo’s face.

Although he had a bit of time Leo followed his instincts and immediately threw himself to the right.

A shockwave hammered the side of his face.

Eardrums — stable. Vestibular system[6] — minor damage.

While checking the damage he received, Leo rolled over and sprang up. He really would have liked to distance himself further, but his opponent was not so permitting.

The moment he was on his feet, the knife was already flashing in. If he had still been on the ground, the knife would have approached from above and it would have been checkmate.

The blade was aimed at his shoulder — it seemed the opponent was not intent on killing a fellow Japanese high school student — and Leo intercepted it with his arm.

The “penetration” magic on the knife clashed with the “fortification” magic on the faux leather sleeve.

The knife having failed to strike Leo’s skin, he proceeded to slam a fist into the soldier’s chin. It was a superb left hook.

The power of the strike, strengthened by genetic manipulation and then even further by relentless training was enough to knock out the seasoned soldier in a single blow. The movement of the other nine soldiers, however, was not affected.

Without a moment’s pause, more knives came flashing in from both sides. Just one had been barely manageable, and now there were two of them. Furthermore, the lengths of the blades were different.

Even a master swordsman would have found it difficult to deal with that combination of blows. And despite his superhuman reflexes and however fast his reactions were, Leo was no master swordsman. In order to learn to wield Usuba Kagerou, in the short period of time Leo spent in the Chiba dojo, he had acquired the sword ability of a black belt. But there were limits. The rich soil of his capabilities could only do so much against the storm.

Trusting in his magic, Leo focused on the enemy to his left.

He shut out the sight of the knife approaching from the right.

Sliding under the slim sword aimed at his clavicle, he sprang up and swung his left arm around.

The impact of Leo’s punch on the opponent’s nose was almost simultaneous with the sound of blade ringing on blade.

“—Thanks for the assist.”

Leo’s flicker punch had merely grazed the enemy’s face, and was far from decisive.

The attacking two soldiers jumped back out of reach.

One of them was empty handed.

The knife he had held was stamped firmly under Leo’s foot.

“You seemed like you were in trouble.”

What had knocked it out of his hand was Erika’s sword.

“Well, even if I hadn’t jumped in it seems Miyuki was ready to cover you.”

Looking back, Leo saw Miyuki merely return a faint smile. If Erika hadn’t arrived in time, it was likely the enemies’ arms would have been frozen solid.

Leo felt an involuntary shudder.

“Where’s Tatsuya?”

Trying to suppress the feeling, he changed the subject.

“He’s having fun with the guys who were circling around back.”

Erika purposely replied in a loud voice.

As per her intention, the soldiers seemed rather agitated.

“Miyuki, Tatsuya-kun said for you to link up with him.”

“What about Pixie?”

Still on the sidelines, Miyuki replied to Erika’s message in a slightly flustered voice.

—Although this was not the time to be laughing, Erika couldn’t help but feel a laugh coming up her throat.

“Pixie will assist us. Pixie, instructions should have come from Tatsuya-kun already right?”

[As per Master’s orders, authorisation for use of psychic powers, confirmed.]

“And there it is. Miyuki, just leave this place-to-us.”

Despite the situation, Erika was perfectly content to make a show.

“Then, please take care.”

Miyuki’s reply was brief, then she left without looking back.

“Ahh~h……do you even know where he is? Well, that would be rather insensitive.”

“You two over there.”

Leo’s face too was different from before, a fearless expression welling up.

Although he himself was desperately trying to suppress it.

“Now then……it’s been left to us, so shall we clean up?”

Aware of the change in Leo, and deliberately not pointing it out, Erika gripped Mizuchimaru. At that moment.

“No, that’s enough. Erika, sheathe your sword.”

A new player appeared on the stage.

Erika sharply drew a breath.

The tall shadow who came out from the darkness of the artificial forest was,

“Jikei-ue[7]……”

Erika’s second eldest brother, Chiba Naotsugu.




The reason Tatsuya called Miyuki to his side was not purely because he was worried about her. Of course such an element always existed, but consciously at least the reason was different. He had perceived a situation occurring beyond Leo and Erika’s abilities to deal with. In order to handle it, Miyuki’s powers would be necessary.

And the situation he had predicted had occurred.

Right behind him, Miyuki gasped. –Devastation was spread out before her.

In front of Tatsuya, in twos and threes, lay the fallen bodies of the defence forces. Although they didn’t know, these were the combatants sent by the Kudou.

This was not Tatsuya’s handiwork.

Rather it was the Parasites, now engaged in battle with Lina.

“Lina, get back!”

“Useless talk!”

Tatsuya was not merely watching either. He was in the midst of the engagement as well.

Lina was attacking a group of Parasites head on. Their number was six. Factoring in the number of opponents cleared up already, it was more than the amount calculated by Pixie.

If they had been six ordinary opponents, the fight would have been over. The name of Sirius wasn’t just for show, and as the one whose main mission was the hunter of rogue magicians “Sirius” ’s specialty could be said to be magic combat. Normally, these numbers could never trouble “Sirius” to this degree.

Yet Lina was struggling. If Tatsuya had not been constantly decomposing the magic raining down upon her, she might have been done already.

Lina’s greatest weapon was her activation speed.

Faced with that overwhelming speed, most opponents would be defeated without being able to lift a finger. That was Lina’s specialised style. Even her habit of arming herself with handguns was to match this.

The Parasites however could work magic literally just by thinking it.

Magic born of images.

Without the need for activation sequences or other such media, it was like a “psychic power”.

While this was a strength to them, it was also their weakness. The variation in what they could exercise was limited. It seemed there was also a limit to the images the monsters could visualise, although for reasons different from humans.

One of the merits of modern magic was increased variation. In return for sacrificing speed, an increase in stability and diversity was achieved. Countless experiments and practical situations had proved this was a beneficial trade off. That was why development had progressed so far in this direction.

However while it was a boon to those in small groups or alone by allowing a limited number to respond to a range of situations and focus their efforts, in cases like “burn the enemy in sight” speed was definitely a more important factor.

CADs were tools developed to satisfy both diversity and speed. Even amongst CADs, however, the existence of the specialised type, which traded variation for speed, showed just how major a factor it was.

Both the three Parasites earlier, and the six now.

The advantage couldn’t be said to be something simple like double.

According to Lanchester’s square law, the war potential of an attacking group in terms of firepower was equivalent to the number of soldiers (or weapons, or combat units) squared. Relating this to combat magic, per unit time the number of magic attacks three could output against one was 9:1, or a difference of eight; in this case the potential magic difference between six and two was 36:4, or a difference of 32.

Such a difference could only mean trouble.

The reason Tatsuya and Lina could face off against that numerical advantage was because they could overturn the difference in potential magic difference per unit time. As it stood, however, they could not take the initiative, and both Tatsuya and Lina were forced to focus on defence. Tatsuya in particular had his hands full just decomposing all the magic coming at them.

He had summoned Miyuki because he had predicted this situation beforehand.

“Miyuki!”

“Yes, Onii-sama!”

Those were all the words the two needed.

Simply by calling her name, Miyuki knew what her brother required of her.

From Miyuki’s body, or more precisely from the coordinates where Miyuki’s body was present a torrent of heavy interference power was released.

Zone Interference.

With no definite event modification goal, it was anti-magic solely for the sake of disabling other magic.

A magic which prevents others from modifying events. A technique to shut down all magic except your own.

Lanchester’s square law was established for cases where attacks were scattered and interspersed. It couldn’t be applied to that overwhelming pressure.

Miyuki’s Zone Interference made the area a magic null zone.

In the face of that both Tatsuya and Lina switched to narrow, high density magics.

Their interference strength was only enough to counteract Miyuki’s.

Mounting a direct attack against Miyuki within her zone would have been difficult even for these two, but otherwise despite significant reductions in number and speed they were still able to activate magic.

The interference power of the Parasites however couldn’t compare to those two, or rather the three of Tatsuya, Miyuki, and Lina.

Tatsuya and Lina continued to activate magic in succession.

Lina’s magic targeted six. Tatsuya’s magic targeted 12. Half of Tatsuya’s shots were meant to break down the magic of Lina, who was aiming to kill the Parasites’ hosts, but his Gram Dispersion was only in time to dissolve half of Lina’s magic sequences.

As a result.

Three of the Parasites were hit by Lina’s magic and slain,

While three of the Parasites were pierced by Tatsuya’s magic and self-destructed.




Magicians of the blade.

This was the second name given to those of the Chiba house, for the close combat techniques combining swordplay and magic.

Using magic in close combat was not something unique to the Chiba.

The Martial Magic Arts developed by Stars prior to their separation from the Marine Corps was probably earlier. As if to counter the USNA, the New Soviet Union developed hand to hand magic techniques blanketed under the name Commando Sambo (although this had by now fallen into disuse).

During the tumultuous formation of the Indo-Persian Union, in the northern regions centered around Delhi, traditional Jamadhar daggers were given modern redesigns and used as weapons.

But as far as it was known, close combat techniques used with magic developed outside of Japan had all been created around assisting “ranged magic” and firearms. The main idea was, while advancing, to output attacks comparable to firearms while exerting defence against opposing firearms.

On the other hand the “sword arts” practiced by the Chiba lay in using techniques to augment the main system of close combat. By casting on oneself to close the distance from ranged weapons to hand to hand, then attacking with swords which were superior at that distance to both knives and bare hands, the opponent would be quickly subdued. These skills, excelling in both surprise and stealth, were a great advantage in guerrilla warfare and antiterrorist operations for both the Japanese military and police.

The swords techniques themselves had not been devised by the Chiba. At the same time as military applications for magic were being studied in Japan, various magicians had been experimenting with the idea of combining swords and sorcery. The Chiba had simply structured it to be easy to learn.

By organising it to be simple to pass on, however, “techniques” became “arts”. This was groundbreaking for its transmission. The previous head of the Chiba was praised as the “modern (Kamiizumi) Nobutsuna[8]”, and for their achievement the Chiba house became respectfully known as the “magicians of the blade”.

In the background, it was said that up to 70-80% of the magicians in the army and riot police were learning the Chiba blade arts.

Amongst those were the guerrilla infantry platoon of the defense forces First division, the “Sword Corps”. They belonged to the Kudou faction, but at the same time they were a close combat unit using short ranged magic and swords, and compared to other infantry units had received training from the Chiba for a longer period of time.

To them, the Chiba were like their master. Although they knew nothing about Erika, who was not publicly acknowledged, they naturally knew about Naotsugu who was famous as the “Chiba Kirin”. Not just knew; the commander of the squad had been personally introduced to the sword through Naotsugu.

And so,

“Assistant instructor……”

The reason they had frozen the moment Naotsugu arrived onto the scene was for that reason.

In terms of military rank, the squad commander as a regular officer outranked the student Naotsugu.

Right now, however, the hierarchy was martial.

Naotsugu stepped through their unmoving ranks, and stood to face Erika.

Erika appeared daunted.

However, she immediately rallied and looked back strongly.

Even if it was bravado, for both Erika and Naotsugu, this was a milestone.

Erika had directed her sword at Naotsugu.

This didn’t mean they were literally pointing blades at each other.

Both of their swords were still aimed at the ground.

Yet everyone could sense that the two were at knifepoint.

Naotsugu was aware that this sister of his, born of a different mother, had always been relying on him.

He had considered this understandable.

Children were not so strong that they could live without depending on anyone — he had always thought so. To him, there was no one who was forceful enough to “become an adult without needing anyone else”.

Normally, these would be the parents. Parents are the ones a child unconditionally relies on.

But for Erika, this was not the case. Her mother was weak, and her father had not been content to play that role from the start.

In truth, Naotsugu also hated his father. The reason he was so absorbed in what Erika called “frivolous” pursuits was partially due to the spite he felt towards their father. Why had this man’s brothers and sisters, looking at he who abandoned his obligations as a parent, not found anything strange with it. Rather, as the head of one of the Hundred Families, it had been seen as something natural.

It may have been then that he felt sympathy for this half-sister of his. In the family he alone had been gentle with her, spoiled her, encouraged her, and raised her to be able to stand on her own two feet.

It seemed the time for his sister to finally become an adult had come, Naotsugu thought.

He experimentally released a blast of sword pressure. While it was a spiritual technique, when used by a highly skilled practitioner it could actually manifest cut skin and blood flow along with the illusion of being cut.

Erika deflected Naotsugu’s sword pressure with pressure of her own. By deflecting, rather than dodging, she was declaring she could face him straight on.

Involuntarily, a smile drifted onto Naotsugu’s expression.

He raised his right hand.

When it appeared he was lifting his weapon, his sword was already swinging towards Erika.

It wasn’t that he had acted faster than the eye could see.

By minimising preceding actions and blurring the line between preliminary act and the true act, he achieved this “earliness”. This was a phantom blade technique, which took advantage of the blind spot in the opponent’s recognition. A skill realized by merely moving his limbs, the sword of the genius.

Erika’s blade intercepted that slash of Naotsugu’s.

He had intended to stop his blade in the beginning, but now he held the course. Countering Naotsugu’s “earliness”, by her outstanding senses and reaction rate, was Erika’s “speed”.

A clear smile now broke out onto Naotsugu’s face.

The tension coloring Erika’s eyes darkened.

She gripped her sword two handed against the sword Naotsugu had swung with one, and pushed back hard.

Abruptly, the pressure disappeared.

Without a moment’s delay, Erika caught herself.

Not bothering to correct their posture, the siblings faced each other again.

Then Naotsugu turned around and faced away.

Wary of a surprise, Erika slipped a slight “opening” into her stance.

Yet no blow came to take advantage of that opportunity.

“Jikei-ue……?”

Naotsugu did not respond to his sister, and instead raised his sword towards the sword corps.

Dismay filled their faces.

They took positions, but their reactions were notably duller than Erika’s.

—He held no fondness for them.

The smile on Naotsugu’s face disappeared.

“National Defence Academy special warfare technology research division, Reserve second lieutenant Chiba Naotsugu.”

Keeping his sword raised, Naotsugu declared his name, rank and affiliation. (By the way, to achieve the rank of second lieutenant while still in school, and a sophomore at that, regardless of being in reserve, was exceptional even for a magician and could only come through having true achievements.)

“I am currently carrying out my mission of escorting civilians who have become the target of terrorists. Please state your name, rank and affiliation!”

At Naotsugu’s apparent about-face, Erika exchanged glances with Leo.

“If you have been mobilised for the purpose of harming civilians, that will be construed as an act of rebellion against democracy. I will oppose you with all my might.”

Listing the Ten Master Houses and the Hundred Families under democracy was really stretching it. They pursued the interests of magicians more than that of the general public after all.

Those were Erika’s thoughts upon hearing Naotsugu’s speech, and Naotsugu himself felt so too.

There was no hesitation in the aura he now emitted however.

With the addition of Naotsugu’s blade, the situation had shifted into a stalemate.



The confrontation between Naotsugu and the Sword Corps was interrupted by an explosion of Psions a short distance away.

“Erika, Leo, take care!”

“That’s the Parasite’s true body!”

Slightly blurred from the speed of speech, an impatient voice flew from the communication device.

They were Mikihiko’s and Mizuki’s voices.

As a warning, it was incomplete.

“Jikei-ue! It seems a Parasite’s true body is heading towards here!”

Erika however deduced what the two were trying to say.

The ones who became wariest as a result of Erika’s words were probably the Sword Corps.

All things considered, the probability Naotsugu had not received a full briefing on the Parasites was high.

Erika was both impatient and hesitant as to whether she should try to explain their threat or not.

Spreading her awareness in all directions right down to the level of her feet, Erika turned to face Naotsugu.

At that moment, whether because she had perceived accurately or by chance.

The ground behind Erika exploded. A figure leaped up from amongst the raining sand and debris.

“Earth release!?”

It was Leo who cried aloud. Of the techniques commonly known as the “art of five releases”, one of the first-class schools of Ancient magic, Ninjutsu, was particularly adept at using the five elements of “wood”, “fire”, “earth”, “metal” and “water” as a medium for reconnaissance, flight and ambushes. That variation was a duality of ninjutsu and Japan itself, but after ninjutsu and its “art of five releases” became famous, internationally all magic using these five elements came to be blanketed under the terms “wood release”, “fire release”, “earth release”, “metal release” and “water release”.

In short, just because this attack came from underground did not automatically make it actual ninjutsu. It was just as likely this was Ancient magic from the continent. There was no time to ponder that now however.

The target of the emerging man was not Erika but the one opposite her, Pixie.

A blade resembling a thick hatchet swung down upon Pixie from the underground assailant.

“Shield!”

Leo jumped in front of her. The hatchet the man had swung took Leo in the left arm, and was caught in the protector of his CAD.

“Leo, that’s a Parasite!”

Hearing Mikihiko’s warning, Leo whipped his arm around and flung both the hatchet and Parasite away.

After his bitter experience, he made sure not to touch the thing’s body directly. But even Leo’s strength was not enough to disarm it. The Parasite brandished the hatchet again.

The monster’s feet however never kicked off the ground.

A sword was pierced through its chest.

Erika, having impaled the Parasite with Mizuchimaru, wore a faint smile as if saying “whoops”. Perhaps she remembered Tatsuya’s entreaty not to kill. She had opposed his words at the time, but it still was what it was.

The attack had not only come from the ground. The moment Naotsugu’s attention had been diverted by the events occuring behind Erika’s back, a soldier had sprung from behind the sword corps with blade in hand.

That he appeared like a soldier was an illusion. Dressed in a navy blue costume indistinguishable in the darkness, the man had deprived a sword corps soldier of his weapon and rushed towards Pixie. The leap was assisted by weight systematic magic. The man’s body didn’t make a parabola with the ground, and closed in on Pixie faster than gravitational acceleration.

The blade held overhead never fell. In the middle of his spring, the man was knocked aside by a kick from Naotsugu.

The flying jump kick was so brilliant it was hard to remember that Naotsugu was actually a swordsman. The beautiful form wouldn’t have been out of place in a karate dojo poster. Erika had always accused Naotsugu of wasting time with “frivolous magic”, but evidently he had been involved in various other aspects such as martial arts as well.

A murmur arose from the sword corps. The soldier whose blade had been taken was collapsed. He had likely received an attack from this man. The feedback from the kick had been considerable, but Naotsugu carefully walked towards the man now lying on the ground. He had been hidden carefully enough that even Naotsugu had not noticed him before the attack. There was no such thing as too much precaution.

Such attentiveness was quickly rewarded.

When Naotsugu reached a distance of three steps away, the man’s body suddenly burst. Naotsugu jumped back, but he was inevitably caught up in the spraying gore.

At this unforeseen development, Naotsugu was at a loss. Behind him, Erika and Leo also frowned. The sword corps were stunned. Nobody in that place noticed the Psion wrapped Pushion mass which issued from both the impaled man and the ruptured body.

“Pixie, link up with me!”

Breaking the spell was Tatsuya’s rough voice issuing through the communication devices.

“Of course.”

Pixie turned to the direction of the Psion explosion, the direction that Miyuki had headed towards and where Tatsuya was likely right now, and began running.

“Honoka, please follow Pixie.”

From the voice communicators set to group communication mode, Tatsuya’s voice flowed again.

“Got it!”

Honoka’s voice was terse.

“Erika and Leo, don’t move from there. Tell the people there likewise.”

“Eh……right.”

“O-Ok.”

Erika and Leo replied in voices suggesting they had not yet fully recovered.

Overhead, the two Psion and Pushion lumps chased after Pixie like clouds blown by the wind.




“Honoka, please follow Pixie.”

“Got it!”

Receiving Tatsuya’s instructions, Honoka wasted no time. —Immediately after acknowledging, however, she realized she didn’t know exactly what it was she was meant to be doing.

It was quite a Honoka-ish moment, but her subsequent action was just like her as well. Being told to “follow”, she decided to monitor her status for now and trained her optical magic towards Pixie.

Although that was easier said than done.

She lucked out.

Despite there being various interpretations for those words, Honoka decided to open the Psion circuits which linked her to Pixie.




There had been a total of 12 Parasites drawn to this world.

One currently inhabited the integrated auxiliary housework humanoid robot, the Humanoid Home Helper “3HP” Pixie.

Two had been sealed in today’s battles.

Four had had their hosts killed by Lina, and one by Erika, releasing them.

Four more had self destructed, being likewise released.

A total of nine had lost their hosts, and that was the number of Parasites gathering here now. As their true bodies, the spirits were drawn to Pixie.

They were all Pushion bodies from the same dimension of information.

Originally, all 12 had been one “consciousness”.

Having their true body exposed, they were now trying to return to one existence.

The nine Parasites had coalesced already.

Whilst sharing the consciousness of one, yet possessing nine wills, they were an amorphous Pushion mass.

That structure of one stem branching into nine, if one possessed “eyes” capable of “seeing” Pushions, one no doubt would have thought of one of the most famous spirits of this country, albeit with one head extra[9].

And it was attempting to capture one more.

Spreading their nine necks, they resembled a “serpent” bent on devouring Pixie.

Pixie fortified her barrier of “will”, and endured the storm.

That will, what drove “her” now, was something imparted to her by the human who could be called her “mother”. Even now these feelings from her “mother” flowed into her matrix of Pushions, mixing in.



The will that she was not one of “those”.



The will that she was not her own.



The will that she existed for “him”.



A single individual’s will would not normally be able to oppose “those”.

But Pixie’s “mother”, Honoka, was not normal.

She was a descendant of the “Elements”. The blood of the Element of “Light” flowed through her veins.

The Elements were those magicians who had first practitioned magic in this country, before the development of the Numbers.

Before the organisation and classification of the four systems and eight types, a classification based on the traditional attributes of “earth”, “water”, “fire”, “wind”, “light” and “thunder” had been used. The Elements had developed in accordance with this concept.

Upon the establishment of the four system eight type classification, however, the developments of those magicians following the traditional attributes became regarded as inefficient, and the development of the Elements ceased.

This could be said to be one of the frequently questioned episodes of the secret history of magic development.

However, the Elements also innately inherited — or were given — gifts separate from magic.

During the dawn of magic research. When fears and superstitions of those against magic ran rampant.

The authorities who practiced Elements development, being labeled as “sorcerers” and “witches”, took it upon themselves to show that they would not be a threat. They had scientists incorporate into them genes compelling absolute obedience to their leaders.

Is this characteristic inheritable?

That is a question which is still unanswerable even now, vexing both psychologists and geneticists alike.

Even identical twins will grow up to have very different personalities. In light of this fact, it could be concluded that “personalities are not inheritable”.

On the other hand if one goes back long enough through parent and child, grandparents and grandchildren, great grandparents and great grandchildren and so on, undeniable similarities begin to show which cannot be explained away by simple “environmental factors”.

With this challenge the authorities had given to them, the genetic engineers took whatever steps they could.

As a result — although it cannot be said whether it was for better or worse — the “descendants of the Elements” have a high chance of expressing a certain trait.

That is, dependency.

It was very commonly observed that they would have one specific person, usually of the opposite sex, that they would greatly attach to and rely on.

The descendants of the Elements themselves believed that their destinies were written in their genes.

Perhaps, using that as an excuse was their way of accepting their reliance on another.

The “dependency” that they felt was not the publicly perceived emotional “weakness”.

Some scholars have claimed that there was a more appropriate word for that “dependency”.

That is, “loyalty”.

An unshakable faith, that “I am theirs”.

That was more than strong enough to push back the coalescing synergetic will of the spirits.




The point where Tatsuya had been fighting the Parasites, and the point where Erika had been confronting Naotsugu.

Pixie’s battle against “that”, and withstanding “that” ’s attack, was right between the two.

Reaching that place, Tatsuya saw the shape of the nine-headed dragon rearing its heads as if to devour Pixie.

He could not comprehend the Pushion information structure. But he knew there was “something” there. He could “see” it.

Nine Pushion information information bodies were joined together at the base. And branched into nine, that interface was attempting to capture Pixie. That was sufficient to resemble a nine-headed dragon in his mind.

“What is that!?”

Lina, who had for some reason followed Tatsuya, exclaimed in shock.

“You can see it?”

“It’s not……that I can see it, but I can sort of understand it. Some massive ‘power’ is pressing on that doll. Tatsuya, just what is that?”

“The result of you not listening to Onii-sama.”

It was Miyuki who responded to Lina. That blunt, frigid voice silenced Lina for the time being.

“Even though Onii-sama had told you not to kill them, you just mindlessly slaughtered the Parasites’ hosts and now the bodies are rampaging free. Lina, how do you intend to solve this misconduct?”

Figured she wouldn’t stay quiet at that.

“What misconduct! I was simply fulfilling my duty!”

“Then please settle the cleanup yourself. Can you? Even if you are unlike Onii-sama, do you have no idea how to solve things non-violently?”

Ever since the combat earlier, a dangerous air had been simmering between these two beauties.

This was just a continuation of that.

“I’ll do it! Just watch!”

Casting caution to the winds, Lina took the challenge.

“Hey, Lina.”

However one looked at it, she had to be stopped. It was far too reckless for someone who had no idea how to begin countering the thing to just jump in.

Thinking that, Tatsuya called out in a pacifying tone.

“Shut up! Tatsuya, you keep quiet!”

For what good it did.

“I absolutely must make this mission a success! If not, then just why am I even here!”

The tantrum Lina threw was directed not only against Tatsuya. Hearing her cry, he himself realized that.

“Here” was not simply this location. Rather right here, right now she stood not as “Angelina Shields” but as “Angie Sirius” — that was what she meant.

At some point Lina’s hair had reverted to gold, and her eyes to blue. Her “Parade”, which had not faltered even under Miyuki’s heavy Zone Interference, had been released.

She was giving her all as “Angelina Shields” to fulfill her mission as “Angie Sirius”. Trying to be a “sirius”.

Glimpsing the heavy burden on her, Tatsuya was hesitant to follow up.

In that moment, Lina launched a magic attack of her own.

A veritable barrage, shot after shot ravaged the air and encountered empty space.

That was only natural.

Lina’s magic was meant to modify physical events. She was simply not equipped with magic to fight an information body.

“That” ’s awareness turned towards Lina.

In Tatsuya’s vision, the nine heads were now arrayed against her.

No sooner than that, a storm of magic fell.

It was all Tatsuya could do to try and bring them down.

When they had fought the Parasite information body at First high, only one person had been possessed and there was only one spirit.

That had already been difficult.

Now there were nine.

He could not expect to weather the storm.

No, on the contrary, there was no way that he alone could have stemmed the onslaught from “that”.

Behind him, Miyuki was maintaining a supportive interference area over the place where “that” existed. But even though Miyuki could “sense” the Pushion information bodies, she could not “see” them. Because of that, the interference area had to be loose. If she increased the field to cover all possibilities, it would interfere with Tatsuya’s own magic.

That barely tenable situation continued, yet it was far too risky for the allied forces to relent even a little.

He felt a squeeze on the back of his jacket. Miyuki was also uneasy.

Although they knew that having lost their hosts the Parasites were now “consuming” magic and had to run out of power at some point, not knowing just how much longer they had to hold out sapped their willpower considerably.

At this rate, Miyuki might end up the same way as Lina.

Because of her recklessness, Lina was now locked down under a shell of Data Fortification.

Not being able to launch an effective attack from their end was too big a handicap.

Magic which interfered with physical events was useless.

Physical attacks were completely out of the question.

If possible, mental magic might—

(—There’s no choice.)

Clenching his teeth, Tatsuya decided to throw the dice.

“Mikihiko, can you see the situation?”

“Yes. I’m assembling a seal as fast as I can, so please hold out a bit longer.”

The voice which answered from the communication unit was even more hurried than Tatsuya’s.

“What is the likelihood that your seal could suppress this?”

The reply came after a pause.

“……Honestly speaking, not even fifty percent.”

His confession was anguished.

Hearing Mikihiko’s answer, Tatsuya did not think any less of him. In a direct confrontation, Tatsuya knew that he was not someone who would make rash promises.

“Mikihiko, just temporarily is fine. Could you suppress it for 10 seconds?”

At Tatsuya requesting for the first time, not just Mikihiko but everyone listening in on the communication gasped.

With no backup or proof, it was just a simple plea. In a (bad) sense, it was blind faith.

Yet it was not something he would do if he did not trust them.

“……Got it.”

At least, that was what Mikihiko felt.

“For 10 seconds, I’ll keep it down no matter what. I’ll signal, so Tatsuya please do your own thing.”

He had a plan, and he needed 10 seconds for it.

In order to secure that time, his power would be necessary.

Mikihiko was inspired by the trust Tatsuya was placing in him.

“Tatsuya-san, I’ll also help!”

Honoka’s firm voice followed Mikihiko’s.

It was not in rivalry. There was one simple intent, that she wanted to be his strength.

“Alright. Mikihiko, on you.”

“OK…… 3, 2, 1, now!”

As he shouted, Mihiko unleashed his Anti-Demon, “Garuda Flame”.

The “flame” expanded around “that” — the nine-headed dragon the Parasites had combined into, and wrapped around the information bodies. It was like two serpents fighting each other.

Beneath them, Pixie was mentally pushing “that” back. The Psion bonds holding Pixie were being replenished as fast as they were being consumed. Honoka saw that the Psions had almost completely captured Pixie’s lower half.

Of course, Tatsuya wasn’t just silently watching.

At the signal from Mikihiko, Tatsuya stretched out his arm not holding his CAD.



That arm,



Took hold of Miyuki’s waist,



And pulled her in close.



“——!”

A silent scream. Or maybe a cry of delight.

In that instant both Miyuki’s Zone Interference and Tatsuya’s Gram Dispersion ceased, but Mikihiko and Honoka,

As promised kept “that” at bay.

Held in Tatsuya’s arms, with an expression of astonishment on her face, Miyuki looked up at him.

As his sister looked up, Tatsuya himself moved in closer.

As their foreheads touched, and their eyes melted together,





As their noses touched, and their lips came closer and closer,

“Miyuki, ‘look’!”

Tatsuya whispered firmly to Miyuki.

An invisible light flowed from him to her.

An invisible light flowed from her to him.

Between them, their auras pulsed.

“I see it, Onii-sama!”

It may have been that those were not words spoken from the mouth, but enounced from the heart.

Their communication lasted but an instant.

More than half of the 10 seconds still remained.

Tatsuya’s left hand held Miyuki’s head to his chest.

Both of Miyuki’s arms were wrapped around him.

Tatsuya’s right hand pointed at “that”.

Within Miyuki’s consciousness, the figure of “that” was now clearly discernible.

Tatsuya’s ability to “see” information bodies.

Miyuki took Tatsuya’s “sight” to view “that”,

Released their seal, and unleashed her inherent magic.



Outer Systematic-Mental Interference magic, “Cocytus”.



Magic to freeze the spirit.



Miyuki’s magic struck the spirits themselves, stilling the Pushion information bodies--

—and bereft of a vessel, “that” shattered into nothingness.





Chapter 17




Even though she had no way to view the spirits’ true bodies, Lina sensed that “that” had perished. The mass of “information” had stopped — frozen, then crumbled. If being able to manipulate Psions within the dimension of information is the norm for magicians, there was no way a magician of the highest calibre like the “sirius” would not notice the collapse of such a high number of Psions.

“Lunar magic……?”

And although she herself could not use Mental Interference magic, by using her magic sensitivity it was possible to guess from the result what sort of magic had been used.

Lunar magic is what English speaking magicians use to refer to a particular branch of mental interference magic, that which specifically targets and directly damages the spirit, and is named for one of the most famous Outer-systematic mental attack magics “Lunar Strike”.

Lunar Strike, of the magics outside the Mental Interference system, unusually has its processes formulated out; since it is used by Stars of the “First Class Stars” rank then in the event that they became the enemy, the method of counteracting it was taught.

Naturally Lina had seen Lunar Strike countless times and thus although it was her first time seeing Cocytus and she did not fully understand its mechanisms, she was able to deduce that it had caused fatal damage to the spirit.

That, and that the caster had been Miyuki.

“Lunar magic of this power……Miyuki, you……no, just what are you two siblings?”

Still on the ground, Lina muttered.

If she had used this magic during their duel……thoughts like that did not fully materialise in her mind. Shock still took up too much of her thought processes for now.

Actually, Miyuki was in a similar state.

Half lost in ecstasy, she was still firmly held in Tatsuya’s embrace. In addition to that she had gone all out with her magic for the first time in a while, as well as having seen the world through Tatsuya’s eyes; she was likely still drunk with it all.

The two who were previously in a bad mood were now in a state of chaos; this was a chance. Tatsuya took the communication unit from his ear and switched it off.

“Lina, do not reveal what you saw just now.”

Looking down at her, his voice was low and intimidating.

“W-What, suddenly……”

If she had been her normal self, such overbearing methods would have been counterproductive. But as Tatsuya expected, Lina was not her normal self.

She had been under enormous stress, and now with the disappearance of the target which had been such a tense load on her she had fallen into a state of collapse. It was a perfect condition for “persuasion”.

“In return, we’ll pledge to keep the identity of Angie Sirius secret. This applies not just to me and Miyuki, but everyone else involved in the incident today.”

Lina gave no reply.

Blue eyes jittered between Tatsuya’s. Gradually, he could see cognitive processes coming back.

Duty.

Suspicion.

Defensiveness,

Vindication.

Various thoughts flickered through her eyes, as within her (psychologically) rationalisation dawned. Tatsuya wasn’t particularly skilled in psychoanalysis nor was he a telepath so he wasn’t perfectly clear, but he intuitively knew that Lina was trying to convince herself somehow.

Her conflict didn’t last very long.

“I have no choice in the matter do I?”

“It’s not like that.”

Tatsuya refuted her resigned words. He didn’t elaborate on the consequences of her refusing either however.

Suspicion nurtures anxiety. Those unspoken words, or rather his unspoken action, were the final push.

“Fine……if it keeps you quiet, it’s not a bad deal for me. I’ll remain silent about you two. ……No one will listen to what I have to say anyway.”

That last phrase was mouthed quietly, so Tatsuya didn’t hear. He didn’t ask for clarification.

He was carrying Miyuki who was still limp; when she suddenly came to and started wriggling around he told her “calm down” as they turned away from Lina.

Only faced away, not moving.

Immediately before Lina could call out in suspicion to Tatsuya,

“Lina.”

Tatsuya called out to Lina instead.

“Is there something else?”

From her words alone it could be interpreted that Lina was still annoyed, but her voice was not as sullen as her words.

The air of being cornered a while ago had disappeared.

“If you wish to retire from the Stars……”

“Eh?”

“If you ever wish to quit being a soldier, I think I could help. No, it’s not that I have any power, but there are people I know who could be of service.”

“Tatsuya? Just, what are you saying?”

Lina didn’t angrily burst out “it’s none of your business” or laughed out “don’t be a fool”.

“It’s not that I particularly want to quit the Stars……to stop being ‘Sirius’.”

She simply answered in wonder.

“I see.”

Without looking back, Tatsuya curtly replied, then began to walk.

“Wait, Tatsuya! Why did you say such a thing!?”

Not turning around to Lina who called out in a loud voice,

“Sorry, I said something strange.”

He merely spoke those words, and proceeded on.

The mechanical doll accompanying him likewise took no notice of Lina.

Only Miyuki, still held in Tatsuya’s arms, looked back over his shoulder, giving Lina an anxious look.




As Tatsuya’s form disappeared into the dark night, Lina returned to herself with a sigh.

Realizing she had simply been motionlessly staring at Tatsuya’s back, she rose from the ground in a hurry.

Why had her eyes been so resolutely following his back……the moment such thoughts entered into her mind, Lina vigorously shook her head.

(It’s just because he said something so weird. That’s obviously it!)

Unconsciously, she had been fixed on his form all the while.

As soon as she was aware of her own actions, she also became aware of her flushed cheeks and the racing of her heart.

The fact was that she had merely been dragged into a “misunderstanding” of her own making, but having in a sense fallen into his trap Lina was in no position to make a sober objective analysis. She was now being held captive in a psychological state similar to the suspension bridge effect[10].

In order to deflect the mortifying thought of “love” from her consciousness, Lina desperately searched for anything else to think about. As a result, her mind fixated on his last question.

Tatsuya’s puzzling proposal.

Wondering just why would he say such a thing, Lina tilted her head.

Was it because her face, her form, being attacked by monsters and having to dispose of her fellow countrymen, seemed to be in pain?

If that was the case then he was mistaken, Lina thought.

Being forced to turn her hand against her “family” certainly caused her chest to ache.

Yet Lina believed her actions were merciful. That she was bringing them salvation.

She had long since learned that humans’ dignity was something precious.

—It was difficult work, yet someone had to do it.

—She would not run from it.

—If a powerful magician fell to evil, then the only one who could oppose them was the strongest, Sirius, in other words only she herself……

(……Only she herself?)

Having never thought the matter over, Lina’s thinking now stumbled.

Disposing of those fallen magicians before they gave birth to new victims. As the strongest, she was indeed the most suited for the task.

There had been no doubt in her mind — until now.

She now knew that was not an absolute.

Even if she didn’t do it, those two would.

Even if she hadn’t put herself through all the pain, the guilt of killing her brothers, those two would—

(I see……that’s why I was so lost, so impatient.)

The cobwebs which had clouded her mind for most of the month now melted away as if the sun had dawned.



Even if she herself doesn’t do it, someone else would.



For Lina, it was like discovering something unimaginable.

She realized that her future she had thought to be decided, unchangeable, was something she could choose for herself. The straight road she had always thought lay before her suddenly branched — and with it came both anxiety and hope.

Having finally awakened from her illusion, Lina stayed wrapped in confusion for a while.




Tatsuya’s destination was the location of the two previously sealed Parasites. But someone had already gotten there first.

Two groups faced each other.

One was a black-clad group, led by an old man deeply wrinkled with years yet standing firm.

The other was also black-clad, led by a young lady in a black one piece dress.

Although facing each other, it didn’t mean they were hostile. The group led by the girl, at any rate, showed no hostility towards the group led by the old man. That was probably because the girl, their leader, herself showed no hostility towards him.

Rather, the girl looked at the old man with respect. —At least, apparently.

“Your Excellency Kudou, it is an honor to see you.”

The girl came forward and curtsied gracefully. Despite the elegance, however, there was no modesty. The light within her eyes was far too strong for that.

“My name is Kuroba Ayako. I am but a lowly member of the Yotsuba, and I serve at our Head, Maya’s, convenience.”

Raising her head, Ayako gave a playful smile.

A provocative yet withdrawn, enigmatic smile.

As expected, however, Kudou Retsu did not rise to the bait.

“A representative of the Yotsuba, is it. You seem solid, despite your youth. It appears you already know about me. Or should I introduce myself regardless?”

Close — although not in terms of friendliness — with Maya, Kudou was publicly of the same status, a fellow Head of one of the Ten Master Clans. The way he said “Yotsuba”, and the way he now looked upon Ayako who was of age with his grandchildren, was as an “adversary”.

“No, that will not be necessary.”

A light befitting his intentions dwelled within Kudou’s eyes. Yet before that, Ayako’s cutesy yet fearless attitude didn’t break.

“By the way Your Excellency, we don’t have much time, so there’s something I’d like to discuss with you.”

At her hasty, or rather determined, attitude, the Kudou elder showed no sign of discomfort. He didn’t think things were as rushed as that, but since he also wished to conclude things quickly he went along with it.

“Go ahead.”

“My thanks.”

At the old man’s liberality Ayako gave another theatrical bow, then looked straight into his eyes.

“I’m afraid that Your Excellency’s objective, the beings called Parasites sealed here which you had intended to bring back, have also been tasked to be retrieved by us as per my Head’s orders.”

“Hou.”

The light in Kudou’s eyes increased in sharpness and intensity.

At that light a hint of trepidation crept into Ayako’s face, yet she rebounded with a firm smile immediately.

“—By happy circumstance, however, there appear to be two sealed vessels. How about this, one for Your Excellency, and one for us?”

Maintaining her firm smile, Ayako looked into the old man’s eyes and awaited his answer.

Kudou laughed unexpectedly.

Loudly, and in enjoyment.

“Oh my……indeed. And you are yet but a junior high student.”

Ayako had not told Kudou her age. His words implied that he had already pre-investigated her before she ever introduced herself.

There was no sign of disturbance in Ayako this time. It was her attitude that it was little wonder Kudou Retsu would have examined even a Yotsuba pawn such as herself.

Having herself known that Kudou Retsu would be taking to the field, that he would know of her was no surprise.

“Very well. Let us get along and go with one each.”

“Thank you very much, Your Excellency.”

Without changing her expression, Ayako patted her chest in relief.

She had no illusions as to her own magic strength. While she was not restricted in her magic like Tatsuya, she was not as universal as Miyuki either. She was a magician with defined strengths and weaknesses. And short range, direct combat magic was decidedly not one of her strengths.

She did not believe for a moment she could have hoped to take on one who was once lauded as the “world’s most skilled”.

Ayako gave silent thanks that by chance there had been two.

And—

(Tatsuya-san, I was able to perform my duty safely thanks to you.)

Even if Tatsuya hadn’t agreed to cooperate, there wouldn’t have been a time to request it anyway; Ayako slyly muttered in her mind.




In Tatsuya’s arms, Miyuki huddled.

However much she pleaded, Tatsuya would not put her down. Miyuki was not particularly petite for a lady, and was of a moderate weight. However much Tatsuya was trained there was no way the weight would not eventually be felt, but Tatsuya’s arms cradling Miyuki wavered not in the slightest. Rather, he was carrying her so carefully that Miyuki did not feel any swaying despite the unevenness of the ground.

From their everyday conduct and behaviour, Miyuki would be the natural suspect for initiating skinship. However, Miyuki didn’t now even cling to Tatsuya’s neck; she merely clasped her hands to her chest and withstood embarrassment.

The silence was painful.

Not bitter; yet, her chest ached.

It felt as if her breathing would stop, and her heart would burst — from the perspective of others it would no doubt be a surprising “overreaction”, but Miyuki herself was desperately searching for “something to talk about” in her overheating mind.

“Onii-sama, about Lina?”

This was what came out.

Tatsuya had shown beyond ordinary care towards Lina. At least, far beyond that of a mere friend.

Because she understood, truthfully Miyuki had not wanted to bring the topic up with her brother.

But now nothing else came to mind.

“Yeah?”

“Lina……did she seriously take Onii-sama’s words to heart?”

Besides, Miyuki was also worried about her.

“I don’t know. There’s no way I could. I’m not her after all.”

Somewhere under Tatsuya’s tone was the feeling that it was unnecessary meddling.

Of course Miyuki knew her brother’s words had been anything but. Even in Miyuki’s eyes, the impulsive yet good-hearted Lina was ill-suited for the military. It may have not been her place, but looking at Lina she felt extremely conflicted.

“Lina has her own circumstances. Not being able to find her way is not something limited to her alone.”

“Yet Onii-sama, you had reached out to her right……? Why?”

“Why, what?”

Miyuki was well aware that they were stepping into uncharted territory. If they were to stop, it had to be now.

But Miyuki did not stop.

“Onii-sama……why did you feel you had to help Lina? Is it because……you have special feelings concerning her?”

Tatsuya’s eyes widened upon hearing his sister’s words, but it was only for a moment.

“You seem to be misunderstanding things in various ways……”

Tatsuya gave a wry smile. But his expression wasn’t very serious. At least, he seemed to be trying to answer his sister’s question in good faith.

“As you say, this is the first time I’ve interacted with someone like Lina. Until now, everyone in the military was much older than me, and they had all chosen their path.”

One by one, he carefully went over the misconceptions.

“The feelings I have towards Lina are not the kind you think. Bluntly speaking, I simply think it’d be convenient in the future if Lina were to leave the Stars. If possible not just exit the army, but move here. Naturalising as a Japanese citizen would be best.”

No lies could be felt in Tatsuya’s words. This close together, they could sense each other. Miyuki was confident she would be able to detect any falsehood in her brother’s speech.

“Of course, it’s not like I feel no sympathy. In a sense, Lina and I are very similar. You could say that we’re in the same category.”

Tatsuya’s eyes were far away.

“Both Lina and I were placed ‘where we are now’ by no will of our own. And although I can at least say that I ‘selected’ to come to First High, Lina probably didn’t even have that trivial choice.”

Although his eyes were fixed on Miyuki, his gaze was somewhere further.

“I took the choice I was not granted. I discarded the ‘role’ I had been assigned, and leaped from the stage I was given. If Lina had hoped for something similar, as someone who was in the same place as her I thought I would like to lend her my strength……”

As Tatsuya hesitated, his eyes shifted their focus back to Miyuki and he smiled uncomfortably.

“In any case, it seems it was rather, unnecessary?”

There was a reason for the turbulence in Tatsuya’s tone.

Up to now Miyuki had been huddled in Tatsuya’s arms, yet now she embraced him tightly

Without thinking, Tatsuya released his hold on his sister.

That being said he didn’t suddenly drop her but gently let her down, probably something subconsciously ingrained into his body.

Even as she touched the ground, Miyuki’s arms never left Tatsuya’s neck.

“It wasn’t unnecessary…… Onii-sama’s care will definitely someday, someday soon, reach Lina.”

Tatsuya felt his sister’s words flow into him, seeping into his chest.

“I mean, after this incident, Lina must definitely be ‘doubting who she is now’. She’s a bit simple, but Lina is a smart girl. Having been this deeply involved with Onii-sama, there’s no way no questions would enter her mind.”

“ ‘Simple’ is rather cruel.”

Miyuki looked up, and moved her arms to Tatsuya’s shoulders.

The siblings laughed together, then peacefully walked side by side.

Despite being a machine, or due to being a machine, having read the mood Pixie had turned into a literal doll, and followed in silence.




Even the heartwarming air between the siblings couldn’t help but change upon seeing this.

The place where they had first sealed the Parasites was empty. The two sealed Parasites had been taken away by someone.

“I’m sorry, Tatsuya-san……I didn’t intend to look away.”

“……Tatsuya-san, I’m so sorry!”

“Tatsuya, please don’t blame Shibata-san and Mitsui-san. I can guarantee that they didn’t slack off. I didn’t notice at all that the sealed ‘vessels’ had been taken away. Even though it was my seal……”

“You guys, don’t blame yourselves. I don’t mind at all.”

Hearing that completely discouraged voice, that self-hating voice and that regretful voice issuing from the communication device, Tatsuya strove to reply with a bright tone.

“Tatsuya-san……”

They possibly misunderstood it as him trying to cheer them up. Tatsuya’s attitude had not merely been out of consideration towards them; he truly wasn’t concerned.

……He was amazed however.

“We got blindsided, but all it means is that they one-upped us this one time. We hadn’t really considered what to do with them after the capture anyway, so there’s no point being caught up in it forever.”

As Tatsuya said, they hadn’t made any plans about what to do “after the capture”. They had only vaguely considered “maybe we’ll ship them off to Mikihiko’s place”, as they themselves had no use for the sealed Parasites whatsoever.

Meaning, the ones who had carried them off at least had something to do with them. If it were them, all they might end up doing was accidentally release the Parasites.

(But, well……were they aiming for this?)

“Onii-sama?”

It seemed she was misunderstanding his silence. At Miyuki’s anxious inquiry, Tatsuya shook his hand in reassurance.

From his state, Miyuki knew Tatsuya was making a guess as to who the culprits were. If he traced back, he could probably track them down, she thought.

—Certainly, Tatsuya had used his “vision”. He knew approximately what had happened here.

However, before that, one of the “culprits” had left a message here for Tatsuya.

The reason he was so listless was primarily because of that.

A gust of wind blew, and stirred up the dead leaves not stuck to the soil.

Mixed amongst them were black feathers[11], probably from a crow, that were captured by Tatsuya’s own two eyes.




When Tatsuya rejoined the duo of Erika and Leo, both Naotsugu and the Sword Corps had already withdrawn.

They patted each other’s backs, didn’t pry deeply into what had happened, and went back.

Pixie was left in the school garage.

In order to enter the school after jumping the fence they had to return to the main gate, but neither Leo nor Erika said “it’s a bother, I’m going home”.

After joining with Mikihiko and the others, the seven of them left school as a group.

Such a large group leaving school at this time received no little suspicion from the gate guard as they exited, but they had prepared an excuse beforehand, and thanks to the dazzling smiles from the girls they left without a severe questioning.



And so, the long night ended.



The events of tonight, the people, demons and spirits, signaled the dawn of a new history in the contention of those who vied from the shadows, yet Tatsuya himself was little aware of this at the time.





Epilogue




The excitement could be heard floating on the wind. The grounds of First High School were full of joyful voices. If he strained his ears, it was possible to hear crying voices mingled in with them as well, but those were not necessarily unhappy ones.

In contrast, the cafeteria was barren. There were scattered figures whose number was less than the fingers on both hands. By the way, this did not mean that the students here were playing hooky from classes in session.

Today was the graduation ceremony.

Tatsuya was not using a paper cup; he sipped his coffee from a proper ceramic cup and placed the cup down directly on the table without a saucer (it hadn’t had a saucer from the start).

And, he looked down on the multipurpose watch that most magicians did not use.

The time indicated that the ceremony itself was already over.

Those voices were probably the graduates leaving the site of the graduation ceremony, Tatsuya surmised.

Afterward, parties would be held in two small gyms. It gave off an unpleasant feeling that even at a time like this the first and second course students were segregated, but it might be that the people themselves felt more relaxed this way.

To be correct, normally this was not the most suitable thing. But second course students might be somewhat tentative when they were with first course students and first course students might not celebrate as much (primarily, about their entering Magic University) in the presence of the second course students. Because there was no difference between the food, drinks and other stuff, it was probably unnecessary to quibble about the different locations, Tatsuya thought.

However, due to the separated locations, it certainly took more people to do the labor than it should have. Because the contractors assigned to make the facilities and the cafeteria staff that prepared the food for the two sites received an extra bonus, they probably wouldn’t complain about the “superfluous work,” but on the other hand, the Student Council hosting the graduation parties was on the top of the list of people complaining loudly about the superfluous work.

It was probably understandable.

Tatsuya was waiting for Miyuki, who was extremely busy with the management of today’s graduation parties.

It should be added — so that there are no misunderstandings — that he had offered to help with the preparations and management.

And had been repeatedly refused.

Azusa and the rest had clearly wanted the help.

However, Miyuki had determinedly refused Tatsuya’s assistance.

“There is no reason to bother Onii-sama with this matter!”

With this emphatic objection to even asking him for the slightest bit of help, Azusa could do nothing but refuse him.

Well, even without his sister’s excessive consideration, for many of the first course students and not too few second course students, Tatsuya’s presence would be slightly awkward.

He was the owner of abilities and achievements that cast doubts on the distinction between the first and second course.

For the third years, he was the rock that threw their final year into confusion. Not taking part was probably the correct move.

Naturally, when it was finally decided that he would not help out with today’s parties, there were people who indirectly said things similar to “this is all for the better” and sometimes Mayumi was there when it happened and for some reason she blatantly steamed.

Mayumi had safely been accepted by Magic University. With her proven abilities and achievements, this could be thought of as inevitable; however, even with the damages from “vampires” abruptly ceasing since that night, she unmistakably had to work harder because she couldn’t give the entrance examination her undivided attention.

She would, from April on, study at Magic University with Suzune and Katsuto, who had also been accepted — as was only proper.

Mari had not taken the exam for Magic University. She would be going to the Defense College. She did not give a reason. However, it seemed that she did not inform Mayumi beforehand and he had seen Mayumi make some harsh jibes to Mari about that — perhaps, she was hiding her loneliness.

The Magic University and the Defense College were not really that far apart; if they wanted to meet, they would be able to do so at any time; still, to have the friend — the pair might not like to call each other friends, but everyone else had been labeling them that for some time — you thought was going to attend the same school with you go to a different school instead was probably not something that can be accepted easily.

Speaking of going to the Defense College—

“Shiba.”

As Tatsuya was thinking that, a voice called out to him.

“Kobayakawa-senpai, hasn’t the party started already?”

This was the very person he had been thinking of.

“Ah, well it has, but I heard from Mari that you were here.”

The magic abilities of Kobayakawa had never recovered from the incident at the Nine Schools Competition, even with therapy that risked her life. There was no loss to her sensitivity to magic, but she could not use magic as long as the suspicion “that she couldn’t use magic” was not eradicated.

It seemed that Kobayakawa had resolved to quit school in October.

However, with only half a year left, even if she transferred to a liberal arts or science high school, she clearly would not have enough time to prepare to graduate and prepare for college. It seemed that after transferring, she intended to spend a year as a Ronin and search for a new career path.

“Do you need me for something?”

“Ah, that is, what…naturally, it is difficult to speak of it face to face… But, it’s necessary. I want…to say thank you to you.”

Tatsuya was comparatively earnest when he looked inquiringly at the red-faced, obviously embarrassed, Kobayakawa.

“I haven’t done anything that I deserve Kobayakawa-senpai’s thanks for.”

“That’s not true!”

In the highly unpopulated cafeteria, Kobayakawa’s raised voice echoed pretty well. She was not expecting that, and from her downcast head, Tatsuya could see her face becoming slightly redder.

“The suggestion about a path that could make the best use of magic sensitivity and my knowledge about magic even if I couldn’t use it was yours, right?”

Tatsuya instantly started to scowl but didn’t out of consideration for Kobayakawa’s feelings.

“Did Watanabe-senpai let it slip…”

Even so, he could not hide the disgust in his voice.

“Don’t say it like that. I forced Mari to spit it out.”

“I asked Watanabe-senpai to pretend it was her own idea, yet she told you anyway.”

All the third year female representatives to the Nine Schools competition, including Mari and Mayumi, had worried about Kobayakawa. Mari, who had narrowly escaped a similar incident, could not help taking it personally. Kobayakawa’s accident had led to the incident involving Hirakawa Chiaki in October, which only increased Mari’s worries.

After that incident, Mari had grumbled idle complaints at Tatsuya. She understood it was not his responsibility, but although she prefaced her complaints with that, the gist of her grumbling was “was there really no way to prevent Kobayakawa’s accident.”

Tatsuya had an answer for those doubts.

The answer was “he couldn’t.”

He was not all knowing and all powerful. And even if the “all powerful” was omitted, he was far from “all knowing”. It was all he could do to use his observation power to cover the area around himself and Miyuki and take care of the duties he was responsible for, therefore he did not have the freedom to look after others. It was the same for the other members; because neither Kobayakawa herself nor Hirakawa Koharu (the elder of the Hirakawa sisters) who was responsible for her CAD had been aware of the trick, nobody else had caught it either.

However, it would be awkward to just coldly cut her off like that. So Tatsuya had sent their theoretical discussion down another route.

Tatsuya had heard from Fujibayashi a number of times that there was a dearth of tactical staff that understood how to take magic into consideration for tactical planning. Because there were so few people with a talent for magic, they were normally sent to the frontlines, so inevitably in an actual battle, the staff managing the tactical planning from the rear were all non-magicians who had only a theoretical understanding of magic.

If someone who was a superb magician but could not use magic for some reason was added to the tactical staff, then it would be much easier for the magicians on the frontlines to do their work than it was now. That was the idle complaint from Fujibayashi, who had seen the problems from both the front lines and in the rear, to Tatsuya. He had relayed that to Mari without naming who he had heard it from.

“Well, she tried to keep it from me. But, it didn’t seem like Mari was all that interested in hiding it.”

“Geez, that girl…”

“I am glad she told me.”

Kobayakawa’s sincere words interrupted Tatsuya’s statement expressing his annoyance.

“I wasn’t aware of it myself, but until I heard those words I was in a state of despair. I said ‘do you think this will defeat me,’ but it was a bluff, thinking that way was only to fool myself into not admitting that I already felt defeated.”

Kobayakawa’s eyes watered; she was probably remembering how she was back then.

“But, when I heard that news from Mari, I felt like my eyes were truly opened. I thought ‘this is the road I must follow.’ This way I would not be left behind alone; it gave me hope that I would not be cut off from my fellow students that I had walked the road to become a magician with. In the eleventh hour, my life path suddenly changed; I thought that if I tried hard for just half a year, I could pass.”

Kobayakawa’s face was once again red, undoubtedly she was embarrassed by the statements coming from her mouth.

Tatsuya did not feel the statements he heard were particularly embarrassing, but,

“So, Shiba, no, Shiba-kun, thank you.”

Kobayakawa’s tone changed to a polite one as she bowed deeply.

Tatsuya was not so impudent as to sit while he was bowed to.

He got up from his chair and clicked his heels together.

Kobayakawa was not the only one who lifted her head up at the sudden sound of the clicked shoes; he accumulated the gazes of all of the small number of students in the cafeteria, but Tatsuya ignored that as something not worth paying attention to as he delivered the salute of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.

“Shiba-kun…”

“Kobayakawa-senpai. It is trite, but good luck.”

As he answered her with a salute, Tatsuya said that without embarrassment or laughter.

Tears swelled in Kobayakawa’s eyes once more however, and she nodded with a smile without crying.

“Senpai, the party has started.”

“Yes, it has. Well then, goodbye. Good luck to you too!”

As she said goodbye and trotted off, Tatsuya sat down.

Mysteriously, the lukewarm coffee did not taste inferior.




“Onii-sama, sorry for making you wait.”

When the lively voice called out to him, Tatsuya took his eyes off the portable information terminal he was in the midst of writing a paper on and looked up.

“Tatsuya-kun, what are you writing?”

The one who had called out to him and made him look up was not Miyuki; it was a broadly grinning Mayumi with the roll of her diploma — as expected, the school used paper — clasped to her breast.

“I’m just writing some notes related to lengthening the time of continuous magic by systematic assistance.”

“…Um, I didn’t think it was a fruitless topic like that.”

Tatsuya stopped before replying to Mari, who looked at him with a stunned look, and simply lightly shrugged his shoulders. He thought about complaining to her about the Kobayakawa incident, but today was their day. With that thought in mind, he restrained himself from trivial sniping.

“More importantly, why are all of you together? I didn’t think either Saegusa-senpai or Watanabe-senpai wouldn’t have been invited to the after party.”

From behind the backs of the female students, who were looking at each other, Katsuto’s face abruptly appeared.

“We thought we would say goodbye to you before that.”

“…That’s thoughtful of you. If you hadn’t purposely come to see me, I was going to come and say my goodbyes afterwards.”

“Oh, really? Because Tatsuya is hiding away from the parties here, I thought you would pretend not to know us and just leave.”

Even though he knew that Mayumi’s sullen face and outpouring of complaints were an act, Tatsuya still felt like he had to give her an explanation.

“I am not even a member of the student council, so I shouldn’t show up at the graduation party right? Especially the first course party.”

“What!”

Suddenly an intense exclamation interrupted the explanation Tatsuya was framing.

A shiny blonde head of hair pushed through the graduates to appear in front of Tatsuya.

“Why was I, who am not even a proper member of the Student Council, made to help with the party, when it’s all right for Tatsuya, a member of the Public Morals Committee, to do nothing!?”

The one who flared up at Tatsuya and insolently spelled out her workload was Lina.

“…Public Morals Committee members are not Student Council members. Besides, although it is only temporary, aren’t you a member of the Student Council?”

“I just don’t get it!”

Lina was probably not all that bothered by the graduates’ stares. In front of the bewildered Mayumi and the others, Lina was her usual self.

“Hey Lina, don’t say rude things to Onii-sama.”

And, she was faced with the usual speech of Miyuki’s love for her brother.

No, perhaps it should be said that it was Miyuki’s usual love for her brother speech.

“You are a temporary member of the Student Council and Onii-sama is a member of the Public Morals Committee, this was all settled before the preparations for the party started. In the first place, why are you grumbling about it now — weren’t you all fired up?”

Tatsuya did not know what she meant by “fired up,” but unquestionably, Lina turned red before the gazes she had accumulated.

“Miyuki, what do you mean by fired up?”

Tatsuya did not have the option of “not daring to ask what happened” at this place.

“Tatsuya, it’s nothing!”

“Well, as you know it would be deplorable to give a temporary officer of the Student Council, Lina, the type of work that would take a lot of time so we put her in charge of today’s entertainment, but…”

“Miyuki!”

“Even if we said entertainment, we didn’t say she had to do some kind of performance — it would have been alright if all she did was get volunteers from the graduates and the other students, but,”

“Miyuki, stop talking!”

“Lina apparently misunderstood.”

“Miyuki, please! Don’t say it!”

Lina desperately tried to interrupt Miyuki’s discourse, but the amused Mayumi and Mari cleverly blocked her movements.

“So?”

Miyuki was looking at Lina, distracted by the desperation in her voice; however, at Tatsuya’s prompting, she readily switched her gaze back to her brother.





“She took the stage as the lead singer of a band. She stood up there and sang about ten songs, she was very enthusiastic.”

“Yes, it was an extremely fine performance. Not inferior to a professional talent.”

Mari added to Miyuki’s explanation, and,

“It’s true. Shields-san is a very good singer. She has an incredible voice.”

In a not-all-that-complimentary tone, Mayumi praised Lina’s singing.

“Urk…”

Lina looked down, red-faced in shame.

It was not an angry face, it was clearly an embarrassed face.

Looking at that made Tatsuya feel like smiling.

“I see… You’ve made some good memories, Lina.”

“…I don’t care.”

Aside from Lina, the people let out genial laughter at her speaking rudely and turning away.




(That was the last I saw of Lina.)

After graduation was over, Lina didn’t come to school.

When he asked Miyuki, she had given class A the explanation of “she was busy with preparations to return home.”

Nonetheless, he thought a withdrawal order had probably come in since that incident. Even so, until that day, Lina had continued attending school and she probably hadn’t done it to fulfill her assigned role as a high school student or prepare for the graduation party.

It could be that she did it so she could enjoy the life of a high school student a little.

—As he looked at the arrival and departure delay announcement, Tatsuya mused over that.

The day before yesterday, the third quarter had ended.

In short, the first year of his high school life had ended.

Tatsuya’s grades were predictable.

His marks in theory were extremely good.

His marks in technical were pretty bad.

His combined marks was in the lower middle.

However, he wasn’t bothered by that.

In that year he had continued to get entangled in various troubles, but he had steadily approached his goal.

Contrary to his expectations, he was able to build good friendships.

Even taking into account the negative aspect of getting involved in a string of incidents, it could be said to be an excellent first year.

Today, he had come to the Tokyo Bay floating international airport to welcome one of those friends back.

Of course, he was not alone.

Miyuki and Honoka were to his left and right; Leo, Erika, Mikihiko and Mizuki sat across from him.

The plane Shizuku was on was supposed to arrive in a little less than an hour.

“As I thought, it takes time to get here from the American mainland.”

From Tatsuya’s left, Miyuki spoke to him, and,

“It seems like it takes a military plane less than four minutes to cross the Pacific Ocean, so why does it take this long for a civilian plane?”

on his right side, Honoka asked him.

Thereupon,

“The engines are different. Because military planes can go above the stratosphere. Safety and economy are a priority for civilian planes.”

Leo interjected from directly across from him,

“Oh my, you’re well informed. Despite being a barbarian a horse could kick.”

Erika teased.

“Why you!”

“Leo, restrain yourself.”

“Erika-chan, you too, stop constantly teasing him.”

And Mikihiko and Mizuki interceded into their strife, well, as they usually did.

Just then, Tatsuya spotted a familiar gleam of gold among the crowd of people in the lobby.

His friends looked up at Tatsuya who quickly stood, wondering what was up.

Miyuki promptly stood up too.

Although a little slower, she had also spotted the same thing as Tatsuya.

Miyuki followed Tatsuya, who had walked away with a short announcement of "I won’t be long.”

A flustered Honoka also stood up, but for some reason Erika, who was seating directly in front of her, grabbed the sleeve of her spring coat.

“Honoka, don’t interfere. Because it is a farewell to a rival.”

Before the gaze of Erika, who was impolitely twisting around in her seat,

Lina, who of course hadn’t fled after being spotted by Tatsuya, walked towards the siblings herself.

“Tatsuya, Miyuki, have you come to see me off?”

When they had approached close enough to speak to each other normally, Lina spoke first.

“Well. Meeting you here was a coincidence.”

Lina’s momentary brooding completely disappeared as she let out a genuine laugh.

However, she did not feel completely the same as she had been. A shadow of doubt could be seen in her eyes that hadn’t been there when she had just barely arrived in Japan. That showed that in this brief period she had become more mature.

“Oh my? Did I not say I was departing today?”

“We didn’t hear you say it.”

Miyuki finished off Lina’s exaggeratedly mild befuddled banter in one blow.

Even so, Miyuki wasn’t in a bad mood, and she was smiling in a wry way.

“Well, joking aside. I am obliged for the aid of you two.”

Lina’s smile became brazen as she said it,

“Don’t you mean, we’ve caused you trouble?”

And Tatsuya smoothly denied it.

“I’m the one who is in trouble. …You’re an unbending person to the end, Tatsuya.”

“You wouldn’t be happy if I went easy on you Lina… Besides, this isn’t the end, right?”

Lina shrugged her shoulders at Tatsuya’s question.

“I think it might be. I don’t think I am able to easily leave my own country.”

Lina’s voice showed tinges of acknowledging a painful truth.

However, to erase that,

“But, this is not the last time.”

Miyuki interjected with emphatic words.

“Miyuki.”

“So I shall not say goodbye, Lina.”

“…Miyuki, what was that — it sounded like a confession?”

Lina widened her eyes as she stared at Miyuki with a face that had grown mischievous.

“Hmm, I suppose it might be a type of confession. You are my rival, Lina.”

Miyuki was undisturbed by the remark and made that declaration in an unwavering voice.

“You will surely reach out to take Onii-sama’s hand someday. You will surely become Onii-sama’s ally. And that will begin our true competition. And so, I will not say goodbye. Until we meet again, Lina.”

Lina’s eyes widened again. And this time her gentle smile was like the sun matching the color of her eyes and hair.

“I can’t understand what you said very well, but… Miyuki, surely it will be as you said. Now, I have that premonition as well. Until we meet again Miyuki, Tatsuya.”



“I’m back.”

One hour after Lina disappeared into the gate, these were Shizuku’s first words.

“Welcome back, Shizuku!”

Over the back of the moist-eyed Honoka embracing her, which she was patting to soothe her, Shizuku directed her eyes to Tatsuya.

“Welcome back, Shizuku. I’m glad you came back safely.”

“Yes.”

Her curt replies hadn’t changed from before her study abroad, but,

“Shizuku, your aura has changed.”

“That’s true. It has become more grown-uppish.”

As Miyuki and Erika said, the aura coating her body had become fairly mature.

“Did you undergo some kind of sinful experiences?”

“Erika-chan!?”

The one who responded to the broadly grinning Erika’s jibes was Mizuki; Shizuku, the one under attack, only tilted her head slightly.

It was unchanged from what had been the normal commotion; however, a stronger sense of composure could be felt.

“Tatsuya-san.”

“Hmm?”

After Honoka finally released Shizuku from her embrace and allowed her to step away from her, Shizuku walked in front of Tatsuya and looked up at his face.

“I have many things I want to talk about. I also have been given many messages from Ray. Will you listen?”

“Good. I will certainly listen.”

Perhaps, her souvenirs from America were a lot of insights.

That was what Tatsuya thought.




Their talk with Shizuku took a pretty long time.

Even so, they weren’t able to finish discussing everything.

They could not discuss Raymond Clark’s message in front of their other friends.

(It might be necessary to take her up on her invitation to her house…)

In order to relate the remaining message, Shizuku had invited Tatsuya and Miyuki to her own house. To go to the great industrialist, Kitayama Ushio’s, private residence without their other friends.

Even for the Yotsuba, this was not a minor thing to have.

However, they could not choose to not accept the invitation. The information she had returned with was necessary to decide their future course of action.

Tatsuya was reexamining the predetermined conclusion once again in the living room of his own home.

At that time, the buzzer rang.

A shocked cry from Miyuki, who had answered the door’s intercom, reached Tatsuya’s ears.

Miyuki’s face displayed surprise and impatience when she came to Tatsuya.

“Um, Onii-sama, there’s a guest…”

“Should I meet the guest?”

Tatsuya had gotten up because he thought it was some kind of uninitiated guest, however—

“No, I didn’t invite her, but… The guest is Sakurai Minami-chan who I met at the Yotsuba main house.”

“What…?”

Tatsuya also remembered that maid girl.

Sakurai Honami. The former Metropolitan Police SP who was his late mother’s Guardian. The woman who had poured love out to the two siblings as easily as if she was an elder sister or a relative. Three years before in the summer in that battle in Okinawa, the augmented magician had lost her life protecting Tatsuya. The girl’s features were completely like the person the siblings could never forget.

She was a visitor completely unexpected to even Tatsuya.

In front of Tatsuya, with Miyuki at his side, was a girl in a spring-like pastel one piece dress.

After Sakurai Minami politely bowed, she passed a single envelope to Tatsuya.

Tatsuya invited Minami to sit and sat down on the sofa himself. As she watched, he cut the seal and sent his eyes to the letter inside prompted by her gaze.

As he continued to read, Tatsuya felt as though an illusionary pain was spreading in his mouth.

The sender was Yotsuba Maya.

After the perfunctory seasonal greeting, the letter read thus:

“This Spring, Minami-chan will be enrolled in First High school.

In regards to this, please give Minami-chan accommodations in your home.

She has become a good housekeeper; she already possesses enough skill.

You must need help around the house; after all you purchased a maid robot, right? In any case, you and Miyuki-san both are going to be busy with various things now that you two are becoming second year high school students.

She has been informed that she will work as a live-in maid so please do not have any scruples about ordering her about.

Also, I intend to have Minami-chan learn the work of a Guardian.

As her senpai, please teach her many things.”

He felt as though he could hear his Aunt’s high-pitched laugh from the face of the page.

Tatsuya folded up the letter and returned it to the envelope, then placed it on the table; perhaps she could tell something from his behaviour, thus Miyuki said “Onii-sama?” to him in an anxious voice.

Tatsuya took one deep breath and passed the letter to Miyuki.

After a small wait, the sound of air being gulped emitted from Miyuki’s throat.

Minami stood next to the wall facing her as if she was waiting for Miyuki’s eyes to leave the letter.

“I am a novice, but please accept me. As Oku-sama stated, please use me to the fullest.”

Minami deeply lowered her head.

Even though they understood she was the linchpin of an invasion from Maya, neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki could reject a girl who had the same face as Honami.

Armored behind his poker face, Tatsuya could do nothing more than nod at his Aunt’s bitterly ironic “present.”

—In April, the new school year would begin and it would be even richer in mayhem than the previous one—

That unwelcome premonition would not disappear from its resting place in Tatsuya’s chest.



[The end of the first year volumes]





The Ojou-sama’s Magnificent Day Off




Common Era 2095, November 2. Throughout the nation, a triumphant mood was felt.

The evening of the day before yesterday, the news had reported that the defense force had eliminated the Great Asian Alliance’s forward base and armada with their secret weapon. The latest news flowing through the living room late yesterday evening was that North Tokyo had asked Washington to put out feelers as an intermediary of peace. This development had occurred way too quickly, so there were those who did not consider the report to be all that reliable, but only a small percentage of the population maintained the ability to make unruffled judgement.

Much of the population had abruptly become commentators on military affairs — boys who would normally have no interest in politics talked about diplomacy and pragmatic power politics in loud voices at schools.

To the girls’ apparent shock, disapproving glares at a time like this had no power to restrain them.

This was not limited to school. Sighing at the high spirited, irresponsible celebrity on the screen, Saegusa Mayumi switched the television off.

The current time was 10am. Since today was a weekday, she would usually be at school at this time. However, students of every magic high school involved in the Yokohama incident had continued to be given a break from school since yesterday, and First High School was no exception.

As someone preparing to take her exams at the beginning of the new year, taking a break from being drilled on the subjects she was studying certainly caused complicated feelings in her heart, but she wasn’t someone who had been involved just because she was at the scene. Mayumi had been actually involved, so it was good for her to take a break. Unfortunately, she could not relax.

<Ojou-sama, please forgive this interruption of your rest.>[12]

She realized that she had turned off the TV, right?

The extremely good timing of the housekeeper’s voice that could be heard from the intercom was mere coincidence — Mayumi was fully aware of that even as she mused over the possibility.

“I’ll open the door right now.”

She replied as she stood up from her chair. Actually, she could have unlocked it by giving a command to the voice recognition interface of the Home Automation Robot, but for no particular reason, Mayumi opened the door herself.

In front of the door was the housekeeper in charge of looking after Mayumi. Even now, there is an extensively supported subculture of people who wear a uniform and are called a word starting with M and ending in D. …Well, the skirt was calf length, the collar concealed the region below the neck, and there were no large uncovered parts in the back, so this was a functional uniform.

Besides, in this house, the existence of a housekeeper wearing this kind of uniform is not strange in the least. After all this time, there was no way it should feel unusual at all.

“What is it?”

Mayumi asked the housekeeper, who was about halfway into her twenties.

“Danna-sama[13] has summoned you.”

When she heard this, Mayumi grimaced slightly. “Again?” she thought.

Despite being questioned on what happened over and over just yesterday… While Mayumi grumbled in her mind, the next words made her tilt her head.

“He is waiting in the reception room.”

Even though it was described as a head tilt, this was a private gesture made only in her mind.

—The reception room? Not the study?

That was a question that Mayumi had.

“Is there a guest?”

“It seems so.”

It could not be said that they had been together for a long time, but roughly speaking, it was her companion’s job to be extremely helpful to Mayumi. From the short exchange, Mayumi understood that the woman did not know the guest’s name.

“Please inform him that I will come after I change my clothes.”

“Shall I help you change your clothes?”

After considering it for a moment, Mayumi immediately made an intuitive decision. Modern fashion did not present many opportunities to wear dresses that could not be put on by oneself.

“It will be all right. I will present myself in properly formal attire.”

In short, the housekeeper had probably been ordered to make sure of that. As usual, the housekeeper respectfully bowed and withdrew when Mayumi gave her answer.




The tailored one piece dress she wore was in a light color, with an ankle length skirt that protruded slightly near the vicinity of the thigh. After she adjusted the lace on the hem, Mayumi knocked on the door of the reception room.

“Enter.”

The voice that seemed to come from the room was her father’s recorded voice from a speaker installed within the decorated wood door. The recorded voice was almost indistinguishable from his living voice and told family members that they needed to be formal.

Apparently, today’s guests were people they couldn’t be very open with.

“Pardon me.”

Wearing her usual two layer thick mask of a lady, Mayumi uttered the cliché phrase in a low tone and slowly entered the room.

With her eyes cast down, she peeked at the guests’ faces.

The man and woman seated in front of her father both had faces she knew. Even so, they were not the type of acquaintances she particularly welcomed. Nonetheless, she did not particularly hate them either.

However, she did not show any of her true feelings as she stood beside her father with a smiling face and made a graceful bow to their guests.

“Welcome, Hirofumi-san. Mio-san, it has been a while since I last saw you.”

Before the girl replied, the young man stood up.

Nevertheless, the woman with the appearance of a young girl remained seated. And no one raised their eyebrows at this.

They were not maintaining poker faces; neither Mayumi nor her father, Koichi, considered this disrespectful.

As for why the woman, Itsuwa Mio, wasn’t sitting on a sofa: she was sitting in a wheelchair.

However her brother, Itsuwa Hirofumi, seemed to feel guilty about it; even though they didn’t consider it rude, his return greeting was slightly inarticulate.

“I hope we haven’t called at a bad time, Mayumi-san.”

“Please have a seat. After all, Mio-san is already seated.”

“Thank you very much, Mayumi-san. I am sorry for waiting so long between visits.”

It felt like the person being discussed, Mio, had become defiant instead, when she answered Mayumi’s words with a laugh and a cherubic smile.

While Hirofumi seated himself lightly on the sofa, as she asked him to, Mayumi was gripped with the same doubt, “Is this person really older than me?” that she always felt when she was face to face with Mio.

It was an indisputable fact that Itsuwa Mio had turned twenty-six this year. However, whenever the actual person was in her field of vision, she couldn’t help wanting to doubt that truth.

Her height was only an inch or two shorter than Mayumi’s own; however, their figures were completely different. Her body could be described in one word — undeveloped. There wasn’t much about her body that could be called “womanly.”

To be truthful, she could still move her legs. But because of her extremely weak constitution, her body could not endure walking for a long period.

She started using a wheelchair around the time she turned twenty, however, because her body had been too weak to exercise for a long enough period of time. Her appetite was small, which meant that she didn’t get enough nourishment, which made her body weak in a vicious circle. Her undeveloped figure was a result of that.

There was very little bulge in her chest area that could be seen while she was clothed. Calling her completely flat wouldn’t be much of an exaggeration. Her hip area was also as thin as a young girl’s. Mio’s body looked like it belonged to someone around the age of thirteen.

Her facial features matched the youthful appearance of her body. Her style of clothing completely fit her physical features, and somehow gave off no hint of “womanliness.”

However her childish looks didn’t matter; Mio hadn’t made any outings after she had graduated from college and had made special arrangements to take most of her college classes online, so why on earth had she come here today? Secretly, in her mind, Mayumi was scratching her head in puzzlement with the thought of “I don’t think she is merely accompanying Hirofumi by any means, though.”

“We came to say goodbye to you, today.”

When Mio broke that news, Mayumi’s gaze clouded with disbelief — or to be correct, she was mystified by the preceding statement.

“Are you returning to your family’s main estate?”

To conceal any obvious turmoil — but she had no need to feel upset — Mayumi replied with a question.

The Itsuwa clan’s main seat was in the Ehime prefecture, but because Mio needed to commute to university, she had left and come to Tokyo to live her life in one of their other residences. Because her younger brother, Hirofumi, started college just after she graduated, the two lived together.

“I will return to the main house; however, before that—”

Mio cut off her words in a formal manner to hide her inner laughter; Hirofumi was purposely changing his expression, bringing his brows together sullenly.

“We will be going to the front.”

“The front… You’re going into battle!?”

When the meaning of the words “the front” sank into her brain, Mayumi raised her voice without thinking.

“—Please excuse my rudeness. But why…”

Mayumi promptly apologized for her impropriety and looked at Mio and her father with confused eyes.

“The public announcement will be made next week, but the official decision has been made.”

The answer came from her father.

“Mio and her brother are going to stay for a while at the Sasebo Naval base; from there they will go west with the navy by sea. Their destination is something we don’t know; however, their purpose is to urge the Great Asian Alliance to conclude a peace treaty by making a show of force. …It probably doesn’t need to be said, but until the official announcement is made, not a word to anyone.”

“Yes, I understand that.”

Mayumi readily agreed with her father’s admonishment. Naturally, she was only agreeing to the “not a word to anyone” part.

She understood the reason why the military would deploy Mio. The woman was one of only thirteen publicly acknowledged Strategic Magicians in the world, of which there were said to be probably fewer than fifty in total, the rest of whom were hidden. The Japanese government publicly admitted to having only one user of Strategic Class Magic.

The woman’s Strategic Class Magic “Abyss” was a specialized naval attack, but it could also be used effectively on land. Just by having her accompany them, they should be able to apply tremendous pressure on the enemy.

However, even so, she felt that it wasn’t a very rational move at this time. The forefront of the invasion had been launched against the Yokohama coastal region and the military’s actions at the time had wreaked havoc on the Korean peninsula, which had actually brought an end to the October 31st stage of the conflict. As long as they weren’t going to pursue territorial concessions, a counter invasion was already strategically unnecessary. There was no need to say that she felt the demerits of going as far as sending Mio out for several weeks in her condition, even with all the thorough preparation, were greater than the merits.

It was not clear enough to put into words in her mind, but Mayumi felt a general uneasiness.

“I will also be going with my elder sister.”

He was probably gripped with similar feelings of dissatisfaction. However, this was a government decision which the head of the Itsuwa clan accepted, and could not be overturned by Hirofumi. He was someone who could be chosen as the next head of the Itsuwa clan, but he was not yet the “next head”; at this stage, the situation could not be changed by any objections he raised. His decision to at least accompany his elder sister in order to help her showed in Hirofumi’s face.

“The truth is…”

Perhaps desiring to change the ambience brought about by her brother’s mood, Mio’s tone switched to a joking one.

“I did want to see Mayumi-san become my brother’s bride however.”

This certainly resulted in a change in the mood. —Nonetheless, it was in the opposite direction of what she intended.

This remark, unfortunately, continued the previous topic and no one laughed at what was commonly called a “death omen” type of joke.

“Nee-san.”

“…I’m sorry.”

Within the increasingly serious atmosphere, Mio gave a mournful cry and become completely crestfallen.

“Ah, well, we’ll take up that conversation once again when Hirofumi-kun returns.”

Due to his feelings of responsibility as a host, Koichi promptly covered up the gaffe and returned the weak smile to Mio’s face; as a result of the paucity of choices for their expressions, Mayumi and Hirofumi went expressionless.

There was a reason Mayumi did not give a “it’s been a while” to Hirofumi. This was the reason Mayumi’s thoughts scattered when it turned out that Mio was not simply accompanying Hirofumi.

Hirofumi was one of the candidates to become Mayumi’s betrothed. However, since Hirofumi was the eldest son of the Itsuwa Clan, it might be better to say Mayumi was one of the candidates to become Hirofumi’s betrothed. They were both direct descendants of the Ten Master Clans and close in age; one was an heir and one was the eldest daughter of the main family with an elder brother who was the principal heir — the conditions could be called quite favorable.

To tell the truth, the conditions were the same with the Juumonji clan’s Katsuto, and Koichi was thinking about which one he wanted to marry Mayumi off to. (The Ichijou clan’s Masaki was excluded because he was younger than Mayumi.)

Of course, the people in question had their own opinions on the matter and there were other arranged marriage talks that hadn’t quite become engagements; however, Mayumi and Hirofumi often dined together and went to the theater together in a family setting with both the Saegusa and Itsuwa clans. —Despite the expectations of the adults, the pair themselves weren’t interested, hence the mutual poker faces.

However, always “silently going along” only made their moods worsen, which was something Mayumi knew quite well.

“By the way, when do you leave?”

With the redirected flow of conversation, a relieved atmosphere that could not quite be concealed arose — Mayumi was dissatisfied with this weakness — and Hirofumi answered.

“We go to Sasebo at the end of this week; I heard that the ship departs Friday of next week.”

As for Mayumi, while she was preoccupied with her unhappiness, she did not forget to learn the details.

“Those are certainly quick arrangements… Well, please take care. We will await your safe return.”

Impeccably disguised behind her cat’s mask, Mayumi leaned forward in her seat.

“Thank you.”

Mayumi turned her gaze to her own toes and considered that they were probably done with her.

“Before we leave to go to the front, could we have Mayumi-san’s assistance…”

Hence when she heard Hirofumi say this, it was a little difficult for her to control the speed with which she looked up.

“My assistance?”

While implicitly expressing the opinion that “there is nothing I can do for you”, she deliberately tilted her head in a childish manner. Her rock-like classmate would probably pay it no mind and her mature — she would call him “impertinent” — underclassman would see through it and look at her with pretended boredom, but Hirofumi quit trying to conceal his unrest and let his eyes water.

“No, rather than assistance, we want you to lend us your insight.”

However, it didn’t work on Mio. Was it because her effect was predictably weaker on her own sex, or maybe because Mio looked so young herself, that she saw her as an “older woman”.

“Mayumi-san has already been informed, which will make this a quick conversation. We don’t have enough time for a preliminary investigation.”

“That’s true. I understand.”

Mio appeared distressed to her core, with her hand on her cheek. Certainly, her speech and manner invoked some feeling that she was an older woman. Nevertheless, the impression that she was a child overreaching herself was strong — she roused amusement rather than interest. However, that did not make Mayumi relax; she concealed her wariness as she agreed with Mio.

“Magic is resisted by magic. Magicians by magicians. That, I think, is surely what we have in common.”

Hirofumi continued; receiving his sister’s support, his calm had returned. By “in common”, he unquestionably meant between Japan and the Great Asian Alliance. With that interpretation, Mayumi waited for his next words.

“I will be accompanying my sister; the other side has undoubtedly realized this.”

Mayumi concurred with Hirofumi’s statement and displayed her agreement. In the first place, the Japanese side had no intention of concealing Mio’s deployment; besides Mio and Hirofumi’s full identities, their membership as officers deployed in war and capabilities were well known. So under the circumstances they were expected.

In order for a checkmate to be effective, you had to let your opponent know about it. In other words, a secret weapon is not good material to get your adversary to negotiate a compromise.

“The other side understands it is at a disadvantage in naval combat with Nee-san’s Abyss. Therefore, we anticipate a counter attack combining aerial combat power with magic.”

The Movement Type-Strategic Class Magic “Abyss” was a magic capable of creating a spherical depression capable of extending from a few tens of meters to several kilometers. Vessels caught within the magical zone at sea slide down the steep walls of water, tumbling about; then, upon cancellation of the magic, are swallowed up by massive waves as the sea returns to a horizontal plane. The hemisphere can be created up to a kilometer in depth, easily catching submerged submarines as well.

If the distance between the two adversaries was too close, the water movements could cause damage to one’s own side as well. The Strategic Magic Mio possessed, with its great range, could be called the natural enemy of naval power.

However, at the same time, Mio’s “Abyss” was completely powerless against an air force. She couldn’t invoke it without a continuous water surface, and to use it on land, she had to know beforehand that there was a subterranean source of water she could use — there were various conditions for its use.

With the enemy’s battle formation that Hirofumi spoke of, she had no other option.

“The air forces will be left to the JDSF; we must think of how to deal with the magicians.”

This was also a fact she could not dispute.

In form and substance, the magician community headed by the Ten Master Clans within Japan — whether they were magicians attached to the government, attached to the military, or attached to a civilian institution, modern magicians or sorcerers of ancient magic — were self reliant. The magicians who would probably be accompanying the military were included in that “we.”

“Mayumi-san, did you see our magician allies repulse the enemy and enemy magic at Yokohama? I would like you to tell us about the aspects of the enemy magic you saw and the effective magic that was used against it.”

Actually, this was a difficult, dangerous question. She did not doubt the necessity of providing information and she would not refuse to do things she could not refuse to do. —That was how it was.

“…Even though I saw enemy magic, I was always in the rear, and the only time I actually crossed swords with them was when I was attacking from a helicopter.”

Actually she had directly contributed to the destruction of a tank twice, but Mayumi was not intentionally lying. It simply had not left an impression.

He did not doubt Mayumi’s words; however, Hirofumi was not satisfied with her answer.

“Then you were assisting with the civilian evacuation until the end.”

By “civilian,” he meant the non-magicians. Magicians were recognized as a special existence; usually Mayumi felt sorry for both sides of the narrow view that people that weren’t magicians were powerless. However, this was not the time to point that out.

“Til the end would be wrong, but… While I was waiting for the copter, students from my year and below held them off.”

“Then can’t you introduce us to these people? The First High School students who actually fought against the Great Asian Alliance’s magicians.”

When Hirofumi said it, right away he came to mind. The mature, impudent, yet reliable underclassman. The first year who changed a gigantic truck into dust, was encased by glittering psions, and used a miraculous healing method.

Nonetheless, immediately afterward, nearly simultaneously, the recalled words “National Secret” paralyzed her tongue.

“Mayumi-san?”

The faltering Mayumi was being examined by Mio’s suspicious eyes. Mio was not the only one looking at her suspiciously. Hirofumi — and anyway her father — were looking at her with doubt, and Mayumi recognized their impatience.

“Ah, no… That’s right. If you visit the Juumonji family, I think you will hear a thorough report.”

“Do you mean Katsuto-kun…”

Hirofumi was by no means an unpleasant person; naturally he was a nice boy, but Mayumi had felt for some time that actually meant a little too agreeable.

She knew Hirofumi felt inferior and competitive with the boy two years younger than him and understood it to be natural. However, at this point in time, she didn’t feel displaying jealousy was all that praiseworthy.

—Not only that, but letting a younger female discern it.

The “passable” grades she had put for him on one sheet of the report card in her heart were all insincere.

“The others, who should be useful… Would probably be the Hundred Families’ Watanabe Mari, Isori Kei, and Chiyoda Kanon. I will contact them all for you.”

“Please do.”

Well, if all you do is find fault with your associate, you will not feel good either.

Mayumi gave them the names and promised to set up the meetings in a businesslike fashion.




Afterward, she called Mari, Kei, and Kanon right then and there (Katsuto wasn’t home), she set up appointments with all of them and, along with her father, saw the Itsuwa siblings off.

Mayumi really wanted to sigh when they left, but peeping at her father’s face told her it would be a little while before she was set free.

“Mayumi, I want to talk a little; you don’t mind do you?”

As she had expected, just as she returned from the hotel sized porch to the entrance hall you could probably dance in, Koichi called out to Mayumi to stop.

“Let’s talk in the study.”

He quickly walked away without waiting for an answer.

Koichi presented an outward appearance of an elite businessman of the middle of the last century. Anyone would say his health was fragile — his face was more sociable than dignified and the tone of his voice was gentle to match that, but like all the other heads of the Ten Master Clans, no member of his family would disagree with Saegusa Koichi.

And it was not Mayumi’s style to take a meaningless rebellious attitude. While wearing a long-sleeved stiff one-piece that she normally wouldn’t wear, Mayumi trailed after her father’s back.

The study had a classic bookcase, a massive desk, and a single leather chair. Koichi promptly sat down, forcing Mayumi to listen to her father’s words while standing. Since this is what he always did, Mayumi was not bothered by it.

“There were no first year students in the list of names you gave, Mayumi.”

Koichi broached the subject with his daughter who was standing about two meters away from him without preliminaries.

“Didn’t I hear that the daughter of the Chiba Clan and the second son of the Yoshida Clan played an active role?”

Mayumi murmured “Raccoon[14] Dad” in her head. Koichi’s physique was more fox than raccoon and more wolf than fox, however, Mayumi was confident that her father couldn’t tell what she was thinking from her outer appearance.

“Despite that, they are still first years, so I didn’t think they could explain things well to Hirofumi-san and Mio-san.”

(Nevertheless, he probably got the details from Nakura-san.)

While watching her father murmur “I see,” Mayumi thought that. In general, this is the same as the harsh “cross-examination” she received just yesterday; his persistence was more hunting dog than raccoon, she cursed in her head.

“However, didn’t they make unthinkable great strides for first years? Especially that girl who also played a very active role in the Nine Schools Competition—”

“You mean Miyuki-san?”

“That’s right, Shiba Miyuki-kun.”

She felt as though the frames of the lightly tinted glasses he wore for show were emitting a sparkling light. These spectacles were supposedly to conceal the fact that his right eye was a false eye; however, because they didn’t contain any special gimmick for doing so, Mayumi had her doubts about that.

“She seemed like a very excellent girl. A vice president in the newly seated student council and, if all goes properly, she will become student council president like you, Mayumi.”

“Yes, she’s a very excellent child. In addition to being a very beautiful child.”

“Oh, that’s what she looks like in Mayumi’s eyes?”

“Do you mean even from a female’s perspective? Yea, I think Miyuki-san’s beauty is obvious to either sex.”

Koichi’s lips twitched a little.

No trace of lust could be seen in the left eye inside the glasses.

Such a thing especially sparked Mayumi’s wariness.

“Be that as it may… Managing to use magic of such high degree of difficulty as ‘Inferno’ and ‘Niflheim’… I’d like to meet her once. Can’t you introduce her to our family?”

“Aaah… I’ll have to ask about that.”

“That’s right, couldn’t you ask about that for me? Come to think of it, I’m fairly certain that Miyuki has an elder brother? Didn’t you say that he helped you out Mayumi, at the Nine Schools Competition? This is a good chance; I will give him my thanks at the same time — it would be good if you invited both of them.”

The polite smile would not let her read what was going on in his head. The tinted lenses would not let her catch the anticipation in his pupils. —However, she had known him since she was born. She was already eighteen years old — their relationship was no longer one where only one side found the other transparent.

(This was what he was aiming at…!)

Certainly, Mayumi had made Nakura promise to keep the secret in the helicopter. The episode concerning Tatsuya’s special magic hadn’t reached her father’s ears.

However, she didn’t think he had not told him anything.

She was not that optimistic.

Nakura was a sly old fox — he had probably given his employer hints without breaching his agreement to keep it secret, and her father, who was a veteran of countless battles, would be able to acquire much information from that.

Her father was suspicious of him — Shiba Tatsuya.

Additionally, it seemed to be about “something” unknown even to herself.

Within Mayumi, the desire to find out also smouldered, but even now, the feeling that she should avoid touching this mystery was still stronger.

She unconsciously feared touching this mystery would destroy their current relationship.

“I’ll try asking…”

It took everything she had to make that answer.




The head of the Saegusa Clan secluded himself for a while in the study, looking at the desk, when the small sound of a knock on the door caused him to look up.

“Enter.”

The door to the study was different from the door to the reception room; it didn’t have a speaker built into it. According to common sense, a quiet sound like a whisper shouldn’t pass through the massive door and walls from the hallway.

However, the knock didn’t repeat and the door opened without a sound.

The one who entered was an elderly man with carefully brushed white hair, Nakura the butler.

“Your report?”

The question was a little too fragmentary, but Nakura walked closer as his master indicated and respectfully offered a memory card.

Koichi set the paper card with the data printed in a detailed pattern on the micrometer level into the scanner and called up the decoded document to the wide display on the desk.

“The 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion… bothersome. Certainly, this is the unit the Yotsuba are zealously approaching?”

“It seems they are in frequent contact, but their goal is unknown.”

“I think there is only one reason we would have for contacting the military?”

When Koichi said “we”, he wasn’t limiting himself to the Saegusa Clan or the Ten Master Clans — he meant all the magicians in the country in general.

The magicians of this nation did not want status. The Ten Master Clans endorsed by the nation were prohibited from acquiring “formal” political power.

Instead, there was administration, the military, the police and the financial world; in various aspects, the ones who held political power needed the sponsorship of magical skills to continue their personal power base. To not be treated as disposable tools, to be tools that continued to be used, they had made themselves indispensable tools and had risen to the position of servants who manipulated their masters. For this purpose, “to be able to continually be used” by them, it was necessary “to become necessary” and temporary alliances were needed.

In order to gain that, ability was not enough.

A sharp sword produced a fear in the wielder that its blade would be turned against him. The temporary alliances were relationships of mutual trust that they would not be betrayed.

If a magician had contact with the military, then it was to acquire and maintain that trust; less with the aim of constructing that relationship than to solidify it. Such thinking was, for someone who understood the position of magicians, common sense.

However, Nakura did not nod agreement with his master’s words.

“The commander in chief, Major General Saeki, established the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion with the aim of having a magic-equipped military force independent from the Ten Master Clans. The commanding officer, Major Kazama, was known as a person who disapproved of the Ten Master Clans when commander-in-chief Kudou retired from military service. However heretical the Yotsuba Clan is, I think that it would be difficult to win over his battalion.”

Koichi raised his brows at Nakura’s words.

“…That’s the first I’ve heard of this.”

“That’s because the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion did not touch the Saegusa Clan’s interests.”

The question of “so why do you know about this” was not drawn out of Koichi’s mouth.

“For the sake of this investigation” was the only excuse he would receive. Besides, even though the man had served him for a long time, Koichi did not think of Nakura as a member of the Saegusa. And that was surely the same for that man as well.

“…So then, why do the Yotsuba remain in contact with the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion?”

His question was on a different matter. And immediately after he asked it, Koichi had an answer from himself.

“Perhaps it is as Danna-sama thinks.”

Nakura did not have any mind reading skills. Koichi didn’t have any such skill either. Nevertheless, without making certain, Nakura was confident that Koichi had made the same conjecture he himself had.

Koichi took the card released from the scanner between his index and middle fingers and lightly flicked his hand. The paper card he let fly flared with light before instantly burning up.

Before he disposed of the ashes in the wastebasket, Nakura bowed and turned his back.




At the edge of the Saegusa mansion’s extensive grounds, there was a long, narrow, rectangular, cube-shaped building. This simple but not rustic building was the Saegusa family’s private shooting range.

Even if it’s called the Saegusa family’s, the range was actually built for Mayumi. Five years before, when Mayumi took her first trophy in a national level tournament, it had been built in commemoration of that.

Mayumi, who had been piled with mentally draining things from the morning onward, immediately after lunch came to this shooting range and had already been at it for three hours. Determinedly, she shot targets with a long, narrow, cane-shaped specialized CAD with a handle.

Pierce.

Destroy.

Unlike using an actual gun, firing with magic did not cause a recoil that would hurt her hands, but the mental fatigue was naturally harsh.

Nevertheless, to the extremely gloomy Mayumi, this fatigue warmed her heart.

Without worrying about the pace, she earnestly fired, and before she knew it, she had depleted the stock of targets. She cast her eye at her watch and was surprised by how much time had passed; she placed her CAD on the rack and started to put everything else away. —After she started.

“Onee-chan, I’m back!”

However, when she took off her information blocking goggles, she received an embrace from behind that she was unprepared for — a change of plans was unavoidable.

“Kasumi-chan, don’t cause problems for Onee-sama by jumping at her suddenly.”

“Geez, Izumi, you are such a nag.”

“That’s because Kasumi-chan is so ill-mannered.”

The problem was only a simple stumble and she was immediately released (Kasumi was torn off of Mayumi) for which she was, to be frank, grateful for.

“Kasumi-chan, Izumi-chan, welcome home.”

During the twins’ usual spat — that is to say playful bickering — Mayumi restored her posture and came to them.

“I’m back, Onee-sama.”

The girl who politely bowed with her hands together was the younger twin, Saegusa Izumi. A feminine girl with hair in a straight bob that went to her shoulders.

The one who had embraced Mayumi was the elder of the twins, Mayumi’s younger sister and Izumi’s elder sister, Saegusa Kasumi. She was the opposite of Izumi, a tomboyish girl with short hair.

They were monozygotic[15] twins, but because their tastes and manners were completely opposite, ordinarily you wouldn’t mistake one for the other.

“What are you practicing? It’s not an actual physical bullet Movement magic. Virtual Field magic?”

“Virtual Area Expansion Penetration magic, right? Onee-sama has been practicing this magic often, lately.”

However, they shared a similar sharp sensitivity toward magic. Anyone would say that Mayumi’s sensitivity towards the practical was superior to her ability with theory, but the twins were the type of magician that had the same orientation as her. Their ability to discern the identity of invoked sequences might be even greater than Mayumi’s own. Just now, they had perceived the magic she had used correctly from the “bullet hole” that remained on the target.

Mayumi spoiled the twins too much because they were adorable, and the pair adored Mayumi in return. However, lately — perhaps due to their ages — she had noticed them being a little insolent.

“Nevertheless, Onee-sama has certainly been pounding away a lot.”

Izumi’s sharp eyes perceived the lack of remains of the targets, causing her to speak out in a slightly astonished tone.

“Then, Hirofumi-san came?”

Kasumi answered in a smirking voice.

“Onee-chan, you definitely get in a bad mood when Hirofumi-san comes.”

Her unwavering expression disappeared; Mayumi had not thought anyone could see what she was trying to hide.

At any rate, these two were quite perceptive.

Or perhaps I am more easy to read than I believed, thought Mayumi, becoming a little depressed.

“I don’t think Hirofumi is all that bad a person.”

“He isn’t a bad person, but that’s all he is. Such an unreliable person is not suitable for Onee-sama.”

“Izumi, your scoring is too harsh. Okay, what kind of person would be all right, how about Katsuto-kun?”

“Hey, Kasumi-chan, Juumonji-kun and I aren’t particularly—”

“That’s right, he’s not deficient in good looks but the unfortunate point about him is that he wouldn’t exactly try to understand a maiden’s heart.”

Why did — Mayumi sincerely thought this — Katsuto’s name come up; Mayumi hurriedly tried to fix her younger sister’s “misunderstanding,” but neither Izumi nor Kasumi was listening.

“Let’s see, how would I go about making the right guy for her… Anyway, I thinks it’s only natural that a guy wouldn’t understand a maiden’s heart since we don’t understand what guys are thinking.”

“Kind! You’re being too kind, Kasumi-chan! It’s enough that a maiden understands a man’s heart after they become lovers! In order to make a maiden’s heart his, first the man must understand the maiden’s heart.”

“A maiden’s heart… Fine. So, what would be necessary other than good looks?”

“Love, absolutely… If there’s a sudden hurdle that’s too high, a fierce true love should awaken, right.”

“We’ve been together since birth, but I didn’t know you were this much of a romanticist (spelled as person with the mindset of a little girl), Izumi. I thought you were only being rigid.”

“I feel like you meant something else when you said ‘romanticist’… Well, enough about that. Besides, I am not a romanticist, Kasumi-chan; you just don’t care enough about this stuff.”

“Whatever, I’m not very girlish anyway. So, after all, who is allowed to be loved by Onee-chan? Someone like Hattori-san?”

“Kasumi-chan! How do you know Hanzou-kun’s name!?”

Appearing out of nowhere (actually she’d been there from the start), Mayumi was between them because she couldn’t just silently listen to these words. Mayumi had absolutely no recollection of introducing Hattori to her younger sisters.

“Of course, we would know about any annoying bugs buzzing around Onee-sama”

“Izumi-chan, I don’t believe it, you two haven’t been spying on me, have you!? It doesn’t… It’s none of your business who I date or anything else!”

“Wrong, Onee-chan. Izumi and I have school, so there’s no way we can go around spying on you, so there!”

(You’ve been using other people to do it!?)

She was only screaming in her mind, so of course it could not be heard by other people. However, perhaps the twins could hear it somehow, but Mayumi couldn’t see them acting like they did from their behavior.

“Besides, Kasumi-chan and I worry about Onee-sama? In spite of Onee-sama being so beautiful, you’ve never had a boyfriend and you’re already eighteen… You’re even about to graduate high school.”

“It’s not that I can’t, my social standing…”

She was aware that saying she just hadn’t made one sounded very much like an excuse. Even worse, a fairly “wretched” excuse or perhaps a “pathetic” kind of excuse.

“Hey, aren’t you two in the same boat; after all, you two haven’t dated anyone either.”

So she tried to rapidly change the subject; however, Mayumi was not aware that this was also a pretty pitiful comment. —Until her sisters’ counterattack.

“So what, Izumi and I are still fifteen.”

“As for love confessions, I received two today. They were politely refused. ‘This experience’ is not all that uncommon.”

“You’re rigid, Izumi. Wouldn’t it be all right to try dating them for a little while.”

“Kasumi-chan is too cruel. Undoubtedly, all of Kasumi-chan’s boy friends don’t think of Kasumi-chan as ‘a mere friend’… If you keep up with that lax behavior, sooner or later something bad will happen.”

Well aware of her own patheticness, Mayumi fell into a depression to the BGM of her sisters’ conversation.




November 4th.

At last, it was the noon break of the first day of restarted classes.

“President — I mean, Mayumi-san. You seem a little tired.”

Worried looks were being directed at Mayumi, who was visiting the student council room to help deal with the follow-ups, by Azusa.

“Hmm, a bit. But I’m fine.”

“Wouldn’t it be better if you waited till next week…”

Today was Friday. There was lessons on Saturday as well, but third years didn’t actually have to attend school, and the number of them doing self-study at home today and tomorrow was not small.

“I thought I could not endure becoming even more worn out.”

“I see. So you left and came to school?”

Azusa tilted her head, staring in puzzlement at Mayumi’s reply.

Well, coming to school because staying home was even more exhausting was probably something other people could not understand.

She felt explaining would be somewhat embarrassing.

Thus, Mayumi did not answer Azusa’s question and yawned a small “aah” with one hand covering her mouth.

She folded both arms on the table.

Then, rested her cheek on them.

She felt that Azusa’s eyes widened when she suddenly laid down and began to doze, but Mayumi paid her no mind and began breathing as though she was soundly asleep.





Afterword




Firstly, to those who picked up this book, I offer my gratitude from the depths of my heart. To the first-timers, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, and if this is not your first time, I thank you for following this series.

This volume brings the “Visitor Chapter” to an end and yet to the Shiba siblings, it also marks an end to their first year of high school. Therefore, this time, let’s talk a little about the behind-the-scenes stuff on how “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” is written shall we?

As a writer, I do not feel like my characters are alive at all. I have never once experienced anything like the god of novels descending upon me or my characters having their own will. I would like to experience those but unfortunately, it seems like the god of novels has turned away from me.

When I start writing a story, I first start with thinking about the composition before settling its summary. Before beginning each arc, I construct its scenario and from there, I finally begin writing the text of the novel. By laying episodes of “this character would likely do such-and-such in this scene” like bricks, I built up the story of the “Enrollment Chapter” as well as the “Visitor Chapter” amongst others

Naturally, that is not all there is to how I write. There are times when I feel like “I really want to write this sort of scene that I imagined” beforehand but those are exceptions. In such a case, I need to make sure to carefully build the story up in the direction of my imaged scene. Giving specific examples, The “Nine Schools Competition Chapter’s” last dance scene, the “Yokohama Disturbance Chapter’s” ability release scene, and in this volume, the siblings’ combination attack scene.

Looking at it in this way, it can be easily understood that “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” is truly a story about both Tatsuya and Miyuki.

What, to Tatsuya and friends is the last of their first-year episodes, is also to the third years, their graduation. However, fear not. For in this series, “graduation” does not mean that they will no longer appear. While I will not say that every one of the current third year characters will have their turn, there is definitely no shortage of opportunities for their return. … … This means that the number of characters will just keep steadily increasing. To all those involved, I am afraid to say I will be putting you through some hardships in the future.

Now then, next time, Tatsuya and friends will enter their second year of high school. Tatsuya’s situation will also be completely flipped around. While it would sound like the title of the story should change to “Mahouka Koukou no Kakumeiji[16]”, the title will remain as “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” so please do not worry.

Please look forward to next volume’s “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei: Double Seven Chapter”.
