	“Dad, what are you going to do now?”



	Now these two were in the hotel room provided by the Embassy of the USNA. The two rooms next door had bodyguards. This could be called an unprecedented case where the staff of the organization associated with the government were treated as VIPs. It proved once again that Edward Clark is not a simple engineer.





	“Perhaps this goal cannot be achieved peacefully.”





	Edward was not going to ask what his son thought.





	“I think killing is the last resort.”





	Raymond showed no attempt to morally evade the possibility of his father dirtying his hands from evil deeds.





	The lack of secrets between them may have been due to good relations between the son and the father, but from a side of human upbringing, their relations differed greatly from the social standards. Perhaps Edward believed that, in general, that moral aspect could be ignored the moment he gave Raymond Hliðskjálf.





	“But we have to consider this option if we cannot neutralize him with the help of the Dione project.”





	For Edward, the purpose of the Dione project was not to develop Venus and make resettlement there a possibility, which is possible if Venus is to be terraformed. The real goal was to completely neutralize Shiba Tatsuya. And therefore neutralizing the Strategic Class Magic “Material Burst”.





	“But, like you said, it's a last resort. Tomorrow I'll give an interview on TV. The public opinion of the Japanese should be ignited.”





	“And looking at the result of this, we can come up with our next move?”



	“That's right, Raymond.”





	“Dad?”





	Raymond saw Edward frown after he nodded, so he turned to him.





	“The New Soviet Union may decide on the power approach, without waiting for the plan regarding public opinion to be triggered...”





	Edward was concerned about what step the New Soviet Union would make, and, more precisely, what Igor would do.





	“If their "power approach" ends halfway, then Shiba Tatsuya can get the data for a counterattack. So I want you to be careful for a while...”





	“Would you like to study the question using Hliðskjálf?”





	Edward shook his head after hearing the suggestion of Raymond.





	“Rumors say that the New Soviet Union built a system of reverse detection in opposition to Echelon III. I do not think that they will be able to catch on to Hliðskjálf, but... We must not risk ruining the current cooperating relationship with Igor.”





	“I got it, dad.”





	Raymond seemed disappointed, but still agreed with Edward's protest.





	“So I'm free tomorrow?”





	“Don't go too far. Right, just in case, tell me, what are you going to do?”





	“I think I'm going to visit Tear.”





	“Tear? Ah, the daughter of the Kitayama family?”





	Edward briefly paused, counting the advantages and disadvantages of deepening ties with the relatives of the owner of the "Hokuzan group”, known even in the USNA.





	“— ... Why not? You can go.”





	“Yes, I got it.”





	Raymond went into his bedroom with a brisk step. He was probably going to call Shizuku. Edward gave his son a glance with a smile.





	On Sunday, a meeting between Tatsuya and Shizuku’s father, Kitayama Ushio, ended in a short time and in a peaceful atmosphere.





	Help from Ushio for "Project ESCAPES" was confirmed the words of Toudou Aoba about his connections. And Toudou did not force him to do it. Providing magicians with non-military jobs corresponded to the wishes of Ushio.





	At the current stage it was still early to talk about the costs of construction and operation, so today Tatsuya finished with explaining the details of the project to Ushio, which he did not tell at the press conference.





	“I heard a lot of interesting things. It was a useful time.”





	Ushio in an elevated mood helped Tatsuya and Miyuki to the exit from the living room.





	“— If the energy of the Stellar Furnace will serve not only for the production of hydrogen, but also for the extraction of lithium, cobalt and uranium, it would be

	quite profitable. There are companies in our group that are looking for resource collection from sea water, so I'm thinking of letting you look at their research material.”





	“Thank you.”

	Although the knowledge and reasoning of Tatsuya in Magic Engineering were at the highest level, but his knowledge of the industry, after all, was at the level of a regular student. The production secrets that will make a profit from the extraction of resources are what Tatsuya wanted to learn the most. The firm promise of comprehensive cooperation from Ushio was a huge step forward for Tatsuya.





	“Oji*, can we see Shizuku?”





	[Polite appeal to a middle-aged man. Something like "Uncle " (not the one that's a relative).]





	The fact that friends of his daughter came to ask for help together greatly softened the attitude of Ushio. As expected Tatsuya, (or it would be better to say "as he planned"), the presence of Miyuki proved useful.





	“My daughter will be happy if you do.”





	Ushio smiled widely, responding to the request of Miyuki to meet with Shizuku.





	“Mr.”





	At this point in their conversation, a kind maid wedged in.





	“What is it?”





	“Shizuku-Oujosama currently has a guest.”





	“A guest...?” “Yes, now that I think about it, I've heard something like that.”





	“That's not a problem. Then maybe another time.”





	“That's not a problem.”



	After hearing about the visitor, Miyuki tried to abstain modestly, but Ushio stopped it.





	“— This guest is a student whom Shizuku met while studying abroad... Yesterday he suddenly said he wanted to meet. It sounded absurd, and I already wanted to give up, but I couldn't do it because he said he was going back to his country soon. He has a relationship with you, this guy. So I thought you'd be aware of the situation.”





	“— A person who is relevant to me?” After hearing the words of Ushio, Tatsuya asked instead of Miyuki.





	“This guy's name is Raymond Clark.”





	With the information network of the owner of a large group of companies, he should know the meaning of the surname "Clark". Tatsuya finally understood what Ushio meant





	“All right, Oji. We'll meet them.” Bowing down, Miyuki answered.





	“Understood. You, take them to my daughter's room.” Ushio immediately commanded the maid.





	Everything went as smoothly as it was in a pre-made scenario.





	Shizuku met Raymond not in her room, but in the tearoom.





	The door of the tea room was open. Although there was a servant nearby, Ushio would not allow her daughter to stay alone in a closed room with a guy around the same age. Although it could be an order from Shizuku’s mother.





“Shizuku, I'm sorry for the intrusion.”





	“Ah, Miyuki...”





	Hearing the voice from the hallway, Shizuku turned to the door. Was it imaginable that she looked like she felt relieved?





	“Raymond Clark. Sorry about the intrusion.”





	“Shiba Tatsuya... Yes, come in.”





	Raymond was stunned by the invasion of Miyuki and Tatsuya, but after Tatsuya called him, he answered with a smile.





	“Yesterday we could not communicate easily. It's a good thing we met.” Raymond switched his attention to Tatsuya.





	“You wanted to talk to me?”





	“Isn't he here for the courtship of Shizuku?” — Tatsuya thought, but he was also interested in what Raymond would say, so he sat in front of him. Shizuku, sitting opposite to Raymond, moved to a place on the side of the table before Tatsuya answered Raymond. Miyuki sat between Tatsuya and Shizuku.





	“I wanted to hear your opinion.”





Ignoring Miyuki, Raymond answered Tatsuya.





“Listen, Tatsuya.”





	Raymond easily called Tatsuya as if they were friends. Well, at least it was better than using embarrassing names like "God of Destruction" (The Destroyer), so Tatsuya decided to keep quiet.





	“— The project of the energy plant with the Stellar Furnace... Uh, does it have a simpler name?:





	“You would already know if you did your research.”





	“You've already researched this with Hliðskjálf," there was a hint of sarcasm in Tatsuya's answer to Raymond's question.





	“Even if I understood, I did not have time to watch the press conference.”





	Raymond sulked and looked. Tatsuya was not amused to look at the inflated face of a guy, and he easily told him about the name of project ESCAPES.





	“Project ESCAPES? I mean... Okay.”





	Raymond stopped his question because he intuitively realized that instead of "escapes", Tatsuya gives more meaning to the word "escape".





“Are you seriously planning on working on Project ESCAPES?”





“Everyone's asking me about it.” Tatsuya declared, making a tired face.





“Project ESCAPES is not a simple excuse to avoid Project Dione. The first thing to consider is that this project was invented before you wanted to terraform Venus.” He answered Raymond with a voice in which there was not a single drop of friendliness.





	“It is cruel to call it... an invention."





	“So you really want to terraform Venus?”





	Raymond, who tried to object to Tatsuya, was cornered with this new question.





	“Real resettlement will be possible not after just 10 or 20 years. The elapsed time will be measured in centuries. It will be necessary to invest money and efforts for many generations. I don't think the USNA has any motives to take this huge project seriously. No, not just the USNA. I do not think there is single country with enough motivation on this current Earth. If anyone can take on such a grandiose project, then only the world government could, right? I think that's the way it is.”





	“— ... The plan of settling on Mars is also advancing as an age-old project.”





“It is only planned. The methods of movement are not even defined yet.”





	“Don't you think that such a grandiose project is just to force the creation of a world government?”





	After seeing the situation worsen, Raymond changed his selection of arguments.





	“If we forcibly unite the world, the usual war will only turn into a civil war.”





	But even this ended with another argument from Tatsuya.





	“— ... Doesn't Tatsuya have a dream?”





	“I only prefer dreams that can be realized.”





	Even after this pretext, Raymond's heart remained steadfast.





	“But then there will no longer be any romance.”





But Raymond did not have the spirit for this. It seems that the words of Tatsuya will only be something "holy" to him, something that Raymond cannot yield to.





	“When it can be done, it ceases to be a dream. But when you do not know whether it will be realized or not, it can be called a dream.”





	“You're a romantic. Does this mean that Project Dione is only a romance for you that neglects the possibility of failure?”





	“A man of magic, with the power of thought, will fly into space. Isn't that romantic?”





	“Why should I be responsible for that?”





	“— ... Uh?”





	Raymond froze with surprise on his face.





	“To go into space by using magic. I'm not against this dream. But this is your dream? There's no reason for me to help.”





	“This is...—” “The reason you want to tie me to Project Dione is not for chasing that dream. This is based on more realistic calculations.”





	“— ... I got it. Then let's talk about realistic things.”





	It seemed that Raymond had already lost the dispute, but he showed an unexpected persistence.





	“Thanks to the development of the ocean, we can sustain the current capacity of the Earth for some time. But the limits of the earth are finite. Even if they will be expanded, but one day the final limits will be reached, which cannot withstand the growth of the population of mankind.”





	“I do not deny such a future.”





	“In this case, space exploration is a reality that we should not turn away from just because it is difficult! For humanity to continue its prosperity, we must go into space as long as we still have the strength to do so.”





	“— Why will space exploration be the solution to population growth?”





	“— Uh...?”





	Raymond now had an expression on his face, indicating that he did not understand completely.





	“— ... But isn't that a solution? The land has a limitation of capacity, so you need to go beyond that land...”





	Raymond was perplexed to argue with a confused voice.





	“Space is also a limited space.”





	“Is... Maybe it is. But...” “— and space suited for human life is even more limited.”





	“— ......”





	“Even the exploration of space cannot escape these limits. Humankind can only delay the time before we hit these limits.”





	“— ... These are empty excuses.”





	“If we only extend the time to reach these limits, we must work on what we can already do.”





	“— ... This is sophistry with extreme arguments! Space has no real limits! With Magic, humanity will endlessly conquer new frontiers!”





“However, the goal of the ESCAPES project is not to respond to population growth.”





	“— ...”





	“I'll complete the Stellar Furnace and implement the plant to reach my goal. You strive into space to reach your goal. If that's your real goal.”





	Without finding the words to refute this, Raymond slowly stood up with the face of the defeat.





	“Tear, I'm sorry. I’m going to go.”





	“Okay.”





	“— ... Tatsuya. We'll never let you escape.”





	“I'm not going to let you catch me.”





	“I would like to see the day when you regret these words. ... All right, Tear. I'll see you again.”





	Raymond, while leaving, only looked towards Shizuku.





	“— ... Yes. Ray, I'll see you later.”





	Sadly smiling after he answered Shizuku, he went out through the door that was left open.





	In the tea room, though there was no oppressive mood, an unpleasant residue remained. To change the atmosphere together with the air, Shizuku asked the maid to open the window. Using the remote control, she turned on the TV. It was also to change the mood, but the transmission, which was shown by TV, could give the reverse effect.





	“Shizuku, leave it, please.” Tatsuya stopped Shizuku, who wanted to switch the channel.





	Edward Clark's interview on the screen continued.





	“— ... Thus, if we talk about the true significance of the use of magic for the future of people, it should be used for the exploration of space.”





	Edward on TV spoke English, but his speech was synchronously duplicated with subtitles.





	“— I believe that the Magic thermonuclear reactor is a wonderful invention. But it should be used in places where it is difficult to replenish fuel reserves, and sunlight is unstable. For example, on the moons of Jupiter. It will be able to produce electricity steadily even when the satellite is going into the shadow of Jupiter because of its circulation around it.”





	“The period between the Ganymede circulation is only 7 days. Even the Callisto one is a little less than 17 days.” Tatsuya muttered in an ironic tone. Of course, his voice did not reach the place that was on the other side of the TV screen.





	“The development of the ocean can be carried out by other technologies, not using magic. The necessary power for the industry can be achieved by using the electricity generated by oceanic solar power plants and geothermal sources. A rare talent, called magic, should be used for more meaningful purposes.”





	“He almost says the same things we just heard, isn't it?”





	In the voice of Miyuki with which she asked Tatsuya, there was no irony or aversion, but only naïve simplicity.





	“Maybe it's because they're father and son?”





	“Father and son?”

	Shizuku looked a little amazed.





	“I have not confirmed it through third-party official agencies, but there are no mistakes.”





	“That means how...” “Shizuku, did you not know? Didn't you have a welcoming party at their home or something like that when you were an exchange student?”





	The Tatsuya’s question was based on the prejudice that in Amerika, compared to Japan, they arranged parties at home a lot more often.





	“Ray didn't have a party at his home.”





	Truthfully, Shizuku was often called for parties during her exchange studies. But America does not seem to be different from Japan in that it all depends on the particular family and the particular person, how much the parent will interfere in the relationship of their child with his friends.





	“I would like Shiba Tatsuya-san to take part in our project in order to open the future for mankind. I hope so.”





	Speaking on TV, Edward emphasized public principles. Tatsuya, who knew his true motives, grinned at hearing these words.





	Chapter 6





	As of 2097, from the ten research institutes that were used for the development of magicians’ abilities, located at different locations across the country, that were open in the 2030s, half are still working and the other half are closed. However, three of the five officially closed laboratories continue to work, having changed their name and their superiors.





	Built in Nara, the former Ninth laboratory (the former Ninth Institute for the Development of Magicians' abilities) also continued the study of magic as the "Ninth Laboratory for the development of magic", a private research institute co-financed by the families Kudou, Kuki and Kuzumi. Officially the ninth laboratory explores Perception-Type Magic, which is slower in comparison to magic that changes phenomena.





	The study of magic related to Perception-Type is not a lie. But the research is not limited to this.





	One of the products of their research, created by the present ninth laboratory, are the parasitic dolls, that troubled Tatsuya last summer. This humanoid weapon in the form of an automatic doll-gynoid, which has magical power by sealing the parasite in an independent information body that has a human mind.





	Despite the fact that the parasites were frozen prior to the actual commissioning due to inept use during the tests, their effectiveness is assessed as sufficient to be used in real combat. That's why they are dormant, and not disposed of. The parasites in the dormant state are still kept in the ninth laboratory.





	Sunday evening, June 2, 2097.





	A man's silhouette approached the warehouse of the ninth laboratory in which the parasite dolls were stored. In the dim light of the emergency lights was an enchanting, divinely, diabolical beauty, who at first sight did not completely belong in this world, appeared.





	Although Kudou Minoru was a guy of unhuman beauty from the very beginning, but in the darkness of the night, human nature filled mystery, and it manifested in the essence that belonged to the "Man" category.





	Minoru opened the warehouse door. He didn't use magic or hack into the system. Why do something like that when you have a key? He borrowed this key in advance from the Development management department.





	Minoru entered the vault. Inside the room there was air conditioning, but it was cold and dry.





	There wasn’t any atmosphere of mystery. Minoru, who belongs to the magicians of Nine, whose magic is a hybrid of ancient and modern mages, was also able to use Mental Interference Magic and could feel the Pushion waves. He could not see the pushions themselves by having special eyes like Mizuki, but could recognize the waves created by Pushions. If he put this feeling together with his real feelings, it could be called that "he could distinguish them as a rumor."





	And Minoru could not feel the activity of pushion waves at the moment. This was proof that the parasites, that is, the Phantom Monsters, which are the basis of the Parasite Dolls, have now been recorded in an idle, dormant state.





	“Can I be healthy if I eat them?”





	“"Swallowing" one will suffice. Part of the body will inevitably be changed by the parasite, but in "my" * case the person should not be damaged.”





	[Zhou uses "I" in the third person when talking to Minoru.]





	The knowledge of Zhou Gongjin responded to a question in mind.





	Minoru swallowed the ghost of Zhou Gongjin using a loyalty spell intended to enslave parasites. The loyalty spell is "subordination", not "unification". Because of its nature, the Phantom of Zhou Gongjin was added to the consciousness of Minoru in the form of a second consciousness. Minoru felt a feeling that such a consciousness was added, more precisely he felt his consciousness was connected with a personal adviser or a disembodied AI helper.

	“— ... Part of the body?”





	“According to the American army, a body for communication was added to the brain.”





	“If you do something like that, wouldn't that hurt?”





	“I cannot guarantee that it is absolutely safe. But "I" often suffer from physical deterioration because I cannot control psions, keeping them within the permissible range of the body. Parasites are able to control Psions better, so parasitism can completely eliminate body problems.





	“In that case, should I study the Psion control technique better?”





	“In theory it is possible. But your body may not be able to withstand this training.”





Minoru bit his lip. The last part of this discussion was not the first time. The added consciousness (perhaps more appropriately called this "advanced intellect") only responds to questions posed by him, so it will not say something like "You are talking about that again?". Without the concept of repetition, when he unwittingly repeated the same questions, he received the same answers.





	After all, with only the usual effort, Minoru still could not play an active role in the important events taking place. And his body does not allow for him to be sufficient enough, so some "unusual" effort can be used to overcome these shortcomings. Minoru realized that his shortcomings cannot be overcome by effort alone.





	That's why he came here tonight. Here, there was a way to free him from the shortcomings of the body. It was not difficult to wake up the sleeping parasite, and let him take possession of it. He had no experience, but he knew that it was possible without problems. The knowledge accumulated by the ninth laboratory, and the "advanced intellect" told Minoru that it is possible.





	Now it was only to make a decision. Minoru only had to decide. To decide to stop being human or retain his humanity.





	How long has he been standing here motionless? Minoru, who had turned in to a sculpture of a handsome guy, slightly migrated, and once again became a man.





Minoru turned around. He left the room and closed the door.





	After this decision to turn away, the ghost said nothing. The Advanced intelligence only answers what he's asked.





	Minoru did not ask the ghost whether his choice was right to turn around and leave.





	After Edward Clark spoke on TV, he went home, formally thanking the Magic Association, together with his son.





	They arrived at the Los Angeles International Airport at 6 a.m. local time. Edward returned to his office for the first time since his absence at 14 o'clock.





	Edward had no superiors at the California branch of the National Science Agency. Even the director of the branch didn't know what Edward was doing. He had a separate personal cabinet and full freedom to act on his own.





	Initially, these were measures to ensure that the secret of Echelon III did not leak to the rest of the staff. But now everything has changed so that these privileges are given to advance the countermeasures against the Japanese intercontinental Strategic Class magic.





	“Is it 7 am there...?”





	Edward's muttering was an unconscious monologue. The work alone in this office must have had a detrimental effect, but he himself did not realize it. Perhaps it was a habit, tied to this office, because in other places it was not noticed.





	“Should I wait a little longer? No...”





	Perhaps it was kind of ritual for him to order his thoughts.





	Edward threw away his indecision and headed for the communication device. It looked like a regular videophone, but it was a phone with a limited number of communication points, and a built-in interception prevention system using the capabilities of the Echelon III system.





	The selected communication route sent a call to the New Soviet Union. One of the rooms in the far branch of the Academy of Sciences of the New Soviet Union in Vladivostok. It is not necessary to say that the interlocutor was Igor Andreivitch Bezobrazzoff.





	“Good morning, doctor.”





	“Good morning. No, it’s daytime for you, isn’t it?”





	As far as the videophone could show, the drowsiness on the face of the image was not visible.





	“I'm sorry about this early hour.”





	“If you choose a suitable time for me, then you will have a late night. So I don't mind. You have an urgent case, don't you?”





	“It's not a very urgent matter, I just thought I should talk to you quickly.”





	“I'm listening to you.”





	The soft and good face of the sociable man, who at the beginning of the conversation was made by Igor, now became firm.





	“You should already know.”





	The expression on Edward's face was also firm, but not just serious, but expressing a deeper meaning.





	“The Japanese magician of Strategic Class, Shiba Tatsuya, refused to participate in Project Dione and responded to it with his project.”





	“Yes, I know. I watched the press conference live.”





	"Damn it", this thought surfaced in Edward's head. There was no problem that he was interested in the press conference of Shiba Tatsuya. It's amazing that he watched it live. He should have taken into account that the content of yesterday’s press conference was already known to him.





	Igor may have already begun to prepare his own countermeasures. Thinking that perhaps it was too late, Edward took off his mask of calm on his face and was going to continue the conversation.





	“A power plant using the Stellar Furnace, a thermonuclear reactor that uses a sequence of gravitational control. Quite an attractive plan. So much so that I even want to offer a joint research.”





	But Edward was a little late. He received a heavy blow from this comment.





	“Oh, please don't make that face. It was a joke.”





	“Doctor, you are an evil man...”





	Edward could not conceal his traces of alarm, though he knew that it was only a ploy of Igor to seize the initiative.





	“I beg your pardon. However, the fact that the energy plant project is attractive is an undeniable reality. Now it will be even harder to expel Shiba Tatsuya into the orbit of Jupiter, right?”





	“I don't think the Dione project will be stopped. I favor the pressure of our government to ensure that the Japanese government does not approve the construction of the power plant. Or you can make an accident happen at the built plant. In any case, I would like you, doctor, to continue cooperation with us on Project Dione.”





	“Hmm...” Igor made a pensive face. “Actually, I was going to neutralize the Strategic Class Magic “Material burst” in a more, so to say, direct way...” “Doctor!”





	“But if Mr. Clark insists, I'll observe for a while.”





	“— ... Many thanks.”





	“As expected,” Edward thought, feeling relieved. He was afraid that Igor would make a mistake by taking such rash measurements. If his attack is successful, there will be no problems. If Igor destroys Shiba Tatsuya, the USNA will be very grateful.





	However, if it fails.





	Perhaps Igor was sure that he will not leave traces of his involvement, but he is a Strategic Class Magician, known to the world. Clark himself would also be suspected if Shiba Tatsuya claimed that he had discovered that he had been cooperating in the attack.





	Not only the New Soviet Union will be suspected. People all over the world know that Igor was the first to support Project Dione. Charges of attempted murder may be followed, and the project will collapse.





	Edward put off all his affairs and called to avoid this.





	“But, Mister.”





	But the speech of Igor is not over yet.





	“If it becomes impossible to drag Shiba Tatsuya into Project Dione, our country will choose its course of solving this problem. Alternatives cannot be excluded to eliminate the threat of the conversion of mass to energy.”





	It was obvious, and without any further clarification, that the "alternate option", which was spoken of by Igor, was the use of the Strategic Class Magic “Tuman Bomba”.





A bout of stiff coughing attacked Edward because he had a parched throat. He hastened to drink the mineral water from the bottle.





	“— ... Sorry. In order for something to happen, I will give the necessary orders immediately.”





	“I hope so too.”





	The face of Igor disappeared from the monitor. The link was interrupted from the other side. With a strong impatience, Edward extended his hand to another telephone.





	On Tuesday, when chairman Tomitsuka Hitsui returned from lunch to her office in the Kyoto branch of the Magic Association, she was visited by an MFA employee.





	“— ... Are you asking the Magic Association to exert pressure on the Yotsuba family!?”





	“You can understand that.”





	“That's impossible!”





	Hitsui screamed, forgetting the rules of decency.





	“— The Magic Association has no authority to give magicians orders to "Do that" or "don't do that"!”





	The words of Hitsui were not a lie to avoid the responsibility. The Magic Association is a magicians-assisted organization, not an organization that controls magicians.





	“But it has a strong authority among the magicians. The International Magic Association can even form disciplinary units acting above the law.”





	“This is only possible for the limited purpose of preventing the use of nuclear weapons! The Japanese Magic Association has no such influence to discourage the financial activity of a magician as a private person!”





	“Is that so?” the MFA employee asked in a serious tone.





	“Yes, it is!”





	Apparently, this man was not familiar with magicians, so Hitsui firmly emphasized her opinion to persuade him.





	“In addition, Magicians of the Ten Master Clans are stronger than the Magic Association. Even if the association organizes a disciplinary unit, it will not be able to force the Yotsuba family to obey.”





	“but the Ten Master Clans are not a monolithic structure?”





	This was an erroneous argument, so the stress of Hitsui only doubled from these words of the man from the MFA.





	“— Do you propose to provoke an internal conflict in the Ten Master Clans!?”





	“"Provoke" is an inappropriate expression. We don't want something like personal quarrels between friendly magicians. I just wondered if the true meaning of autonomy as an organization was not to constrain its members from the inside but to restrain them from getting out of control?”





“The Magic Association does not manage the Ten Master Clans!”





	Hitsui felt a dull pain at the top of her stomach, but tolerated it and zealously objected.



	“We think otherwise. From an objective point of view, the one with greatest influence on the community of magicians, aren’t those calling themselves the "Ten Master Clans", but the Magic Association.”





	But the interlocutor did not want to listen to her.





	“So, I sincerely count on you.”





	Having said these words in the end, the MFA employee stood up. Hitsui, the remaining one in the office of the Chairman, was covered with cold sweat and felt nausea, and could not tolerate the increasing pain, and grabbed her stomach.





	It is not necessary to say that the Japanese government began to obstruct Project ESCAPES because it was asked by the Government of the USNA. To date, the Japanese government has seen no benefit from the extraction of marine resources.





	In the past, similar projects ended in complete failure, so they were skeptical about it in terms of feasibility and cost-effectiveness. They emphasized that there should be no such weakness in diplomacy and the economy.





	However, the response of the business community was different.





	“Kitakata-san, it seems that you have decided to participate in this Business project without hesitation.”





	Kitakata was a commercial alias for Kitayama Ushio. These were the kind of good manners in business circles, when even at informal meetings they would call each other by their aliases, if they have one. But there were many exceptions when only real names could be used at official events of the government and the municipality.





	“As expected from Muromachi-san. You learned quickly.”





	"Muromachi", to whom Ushio replied, was not his real name either. Although the business of his interlocutor was inferior to the "Hokuzan group" of Ushio in scale, this man was the actual owner of a group of companies, coming from a family business with a long tradition. In the financial world he was a big brother to Ushio .





“— Have you already invested in this project? What can it be connected to?” Another businessman familiar with him spoke to him from the other side of the table.





	“You already know so much. Iwata-san, who did you hear that from?”





	“Yes so... from different people.”





	On both of Ushio and Iwata’s faces, at the same time, wide smiles surfaced. Iwata, unlike Muromachi, is the owner of company that rivals Ushio’s competing group, and their recent relationship was to fight for major foreign transactions. But there were no signs of enmity between them.





	“It's not that I'm hiding it. Shiba-kun is my daughter's classmate.”





	“— Yes, if you think about it, your daughter goes to the National Magic University Affiliated First High School.”





	“So you're in a friendly relationship with him?”





This was asked not by Muromachi or Iwata, but by another person on the opposite side. Although Ushio met with Tatsuya on the issue of the project only the day before yesterday, the news about it has spread everywhere.





	“Looks like Toudou Aoba deliberately spread rumors.” Ushio thought when he politely answered the question.





Even if you hear about a new business, seemingly profitable, it is difficult to make a decision to invest money in it alone. However, when the business already has a major sponsor, you will want to participate in it. For the major players of the financial world present here, the cost of the construction of one plant is at the level of "Well let's try and see what happens."





	“If it's not difficult for you, Kitakata-san, could you introduce him to me?”





	When one person raised this issue, with a slight lag from the rest to the side, Ushio got the same request.





	It was not bad for Ushio that the number of investors would increase.





	Risks can be divided as more and more people participate in the business, because it is possible to divide it so that each participant is dependent on something of their own. And as a result, the weight of the voice of each project participant increases.





	"I'll tell Tatsuya-kun about your requests.”





	Ushio answered all with a smile, when the meeting was coming to an end.





	Having received an order to appear in the office of the Commander after a day training, Lina was gloomy mentally. Yes, only mentally. She almost made a face that showed that she hated orders.





	When she was last summoned to the commander's office, the order was to accompany Edward Clark, as a result she learned the secret of the dark side of the USNA’s army, which she should not know about. Lina was disheartened by the fact that she could again receive a mission with a similar disappointing end.





	But she could not say that she wanted to stop taking orders. Neither betrayal nor desertion was an option for Lina.





“Ben! You've been summoned by the Commander?”





	"You too, Commander-in-chief?"





	Lina began to get a bad feeling. Summoning both Lina and Canopus at the same time was not uncommon, although when she was given the order to accompany Clark, Lina, on the contrary, was alone. In the case of Jiedo Heigu (Gu Jie) Lina was ordered to stay and give the work of Canopus.

	Even if she was expecting a mission in which she would not be able to show a decent result, but provided Canopus is there, it is likely that he will help her in a difficult moment. So the fact that she was called together with Canopus was a good circumstance for Lina.





	But, for some reason, this time she was not able to suppress a sinister premonition. Isn't it because the mission is expected to be heavy if both she and Canopus were to be sent together? She could not get rid of such thoughts.





	“Major Angelina Sirius has arrived.”





	“Major Benjamin Canopus arrived.”





	“Enter.” The voice of the base Commander, Colonel Walker, was heard from behind the door.





	Lina beat Canopus, and she opened the door. The next moment Lina froze when she saw a superior officer, who was not supposed to be here.





	“Colonel Balance...?” A stunned Lina muttered, but she quickly regained composure, and entered the Commander's office and vigorously saluted. Canopus entered immediately after Lina and stood beside her. Colonel Walker went up and saluted them in return.





	“At ease.” Walker said this to these two and sat back on the chair. Balance, in the meantime, stood motionless on the side of the table.





	"Major Sirius, Major Canopus, this is a special case, and I want to hear the opinion of both of you.”





	“Opinion?”





	“Yes. Having heard the opinion of each of you, I want to decide whether it is worth to entrust the Stars with this mission.”



	Having heard the words of Walker, Lina and Canopus unwittingly looked. As Walker said, this was a special occasion. It is normal to ask the opinion of subordinates during strategy preparation. But when the goal is already known, the means of achieving this goal are asked. And the question of whether or not to carry out the mission at all is usually solved at a higher level, and there should be no exceptions to this rule.





	"I think you already know that the magician who, on October 31, 2095, used Japan's Strategic Class Magic, the day we call "Scorched Halloween", is a young man named Shiba Tatsuya.”





	Lina and Canopus at the same time returned to Walker a positive response.





	“— Did you know that Shiba Tatsuya rejected the proposal of the National Scientific Agency and launched a new project?”





	“I know.” Canopus answered. Lina also knew that Tatsuya refused to participate in the Dione project, but did not know the details.





	“It's an energetic plant with a Stellar Furnace based on a Gravity Control-Type Magic Sequence. If this plan is implemented, the resource industry of our country will again receive a strong blow.”





	Oil, coal and nuclear plants were greatly damaged when energy sources switched from fossil fuels to solar, wind, geothermal, and biofuels. But by going into the sphere of biofuels, which requires a vast amount of land, as well as by developing small reactors for areas with low solar activity, they managed to restore their positions and live to the present time.





-“... In addition, with the development of magic controlling nuclear fission and blocking radiation, the people’s rejection of nuclear energy has decreased compared to the last century. For the most part, the decline in nuclear power was due to rising uranium prices and the high cost of the magicians needed to counter accidents. Nuclear weapons were sealed and the withdrawal of plutonium for civilian use was carried out.”





	“— even if you do not pay attention to the circumstances in the industrial area, it will be inconvenient for our country if we cannot neutralize the Shiba Tatsuya with the help of Project Dione.”





	“This cannot be?” , Lina thought.





	“In this regard, the general staff thought that it is necessary to arrange a diversion at Shiba Tatsuya’s plant. The view was also expressed that the threat of a presumably intercontinental range of the Strategic Class Magic "Material Burst" would be eliminated if Shiba Tatsuya could be eliminated at this stage.





	"Worst case scenario," Lina thought.





	She did not know the details, but as far as she had heard, Tatsuya’s project was to build a commercial plant.





	And to help their entrepreneurs, they want to destroy his army.





	Although this would be very difficult, but the true goal seems to be the assassination of Shiba Tatsuya. Since when did the Stars become a group of killers like the mafia?





	“Major Sirius, Major Canopus, what do you think?”





	“Colonel, let me express my opinion!”





	Instead of answering Walker's question, Lina asked for permission to answer. It wasn't because she kept calm. Just the opposite. As she had the feeling that her head was about to boil, she tried to restore the lost self-control, deliberately observing military discipline.





	“Authorized." Walker made no remark about this and just gave Lina permission.





	“I'm against it. Although the magic of converting mass into energy is certainly a threat, but Shiba Tatsuya is a man from a union country and is not hostile to our country. To kill him only because he poses a potential threat are like the methods of the Mafia. I believe that the army should not dirty their hands with murders of this nature.”





	“I'm against it, Colonel.”

	“Major Canopus, you too?”





	Walker listened to Lina's opinion with a stone face, but when Canopus also objected, Walker's face flashed astonishment.





	“Yes. I do not think that even the diversion of the plant itself is a good idea, let alone the pros and cons of murder. Yes, the energy industry can be temporarily hit. However, the supply of cheap hydrogen fuel, extracted from sea water, can improve the lives and citizens of our country. Actions against Tatsuya should not be murder or interference of his activities. Wouldn't it be better instead to ask him to provide our country with the know-how of a thermonuclear reactor?”





	“— Do you think that we should not hinder him, but ask him?”





	“Confirmed. Since the military will be used in certain areas for commercial purposes, the energy industry would be affected badly because the army would prevent it. I do not deny the aspects of the interdependence of the army and the economy, but a certain 'brake' is still needed.”





	“Colonel Walker, may I offer my opinion too?” said Balance, standing on the side of Commander Walker's desk.





	“Please.” Walker willingly allowed her. At least it looked like that.





	“Thanks. I do not know what to say about the principal views of Major Sirius, but I believe that the opinion of Major Canopus is worth considering.”





	Lina was shocked by these words and though Balance noticed this, she ignored it,.



	Turning to Walker, she continued to express her opinion.





	“There is one delicate side to the evaluation of Stars by people who are not magicians. If the Stars act in the interests of a specific company, or a particular industry, even if people would only think we are doing so, there is a fear that there will be intense opposition from other industries and consumer organizations.”





	"But can’t we just sabotage it in strict secrecy?"





	“The enemy is also quite capable. It would be unrealistic to conduct a diversion at the plant without leaving any clues.”





	Walker had to recognize what Balance said. It is almost impossible to carry out a large-scale sabotage on the plant so that it does not attract public attention.





	When it is possible to investigate the traces of the caused damage, there is always a limit to what makes it look like an accident. The main prerequisite for preparing a crime against someone else's military force is to ensure that they will not be able to examine the evidence in detail. You can, of course, escape from the punishment, pretending that you do not know anything, but the spreading of rumors cannot be avoided. In terms of the fact that there will be a minimum amount of clues, killing one person, Tatsuya, was much simpler.





	“— so your opinion, as well as the opinion of both Majors, is that there are more shortcomings?... Got you. I'll ask the General staff to cancel the operation.”





	The one who felt most relieved from Walker's decision was Lina.





	After leaving the office of the Commander, Balance led Lina to another room.





	“Major Sirius, how have you been doing lately?”





	“Yes, there are no problems.”





	They sat at the same table from different angles. Standing up to talk would be tedious, so Balance insisted that they sit down.





	Before Lina was not a cup of honey milk, but a whole mug of American coffee. After she came back from Japan last year, she probably thought it was a weakness to show others that she was drinking milk, and from then on, outside of her room, pretends to prefer coffee. But recently her stomach, apparently, could not withstand hard brewed coffee, so the cream and sugar became irreplaceable.

	“Understood.”





	Before Balance also stood American coffee. Only hers was black. It was originally pretty hard boiled, but if you add cream and sugar to it, the taste would be lost.





	“Returning to the recent conversation...”





	“Yes.”





	Lina straightened out, sitting on a chair. Although they were the only two in the room, she didn't know what the conversation was about. She was also worried about being able to talk about it in a place like this.





	“Although Colonel Walker said he would ask to cancel the operation, we don't know what the General Staff's decision would be. Maybe you'll be nominated for the order.”





	“Then I'll fulfill my responsibilities.”





	The reaction of Lina was too fast, because it apparently implied the presence of other’s “views” here.





	“Hmm.”





	Although Balance noticed this, she did not pay attention to it. It could be said that it was a demonstration of her position that it would not be a problem.





	“The Defense Ministry also has one more opinion.”





	“Do you mean that there is another policy towards Tatsuya?”





	The Balance’s voice was like a monologue, but Lina was forced to ask, as if she heard.



	“The opinion is that it is necessary not to conflict with him, but to use him. This is very close to the earlier voiced opinion of Major Canopus.”





	“You mean Ben's opinion... What does it take to secure the right to know-how of a thermonuclear reactor?”





	“Yes. To use the know-how of a magical thermonuclear reactor for the economy. And for military purposes to be used as a distributed deterrent force.”





	“Distributed deterrent force...?”





	Having seen the puzzled Lina, Balance involuntarily smiled.





	"This distribution concerns you too, Major Sirius.”





	“That? How does it relate to me?”





	“Don't you understand?”





	With a smile Balance was trying to nuance between "You can't do anything", and not "You're stupid."





	“From the "Scorched Halloween" situation, it seems that they can also use a satellite aiming system. Perhaps its accuracy is even better than ours. If we can capture this know-how too, then with the Major’s Heavy Metal burst and Material Burst of Shiba Tatsuya, we will dominate the military forces of the world. This should lead to the rejection of at least large-scale military action.”





	“Me and Tatsuya working together...?”





	“Initially, our army did not plan to use your Strategic Class Magic just for defense. Like "Leviathan", that depends highly on the defense/seizure position, the place of use for Heavy Metal Burst cannot be chosen.”

	To be more precise, Heavy Metal Burst cannot provide sufficient power if a certain amount of heavy metal is not available in the area, and its effect will be severely limited in geographical conditions with very rough, hilly surface.



	But compared to "Leviathan", which can only show its true value only on terrain with an abundance of water, for example, on the sea, a large lake or a wide river, Heavy Metal Burst has more freedom of use. Although it is inferior to "Ozone Circle" and "Agni-Downburst" In terms of a lack of influence of geographical conditions, but if you add other conditions, such as power and speed of activation, we can say that Heavy Metal Burst is a suitable replacement for strategic ballistic missiles for the role as a deterrent force.





	“What's the surprise? The New Soviet Union and Japan. If this alliance is formed, then Japan is an ally that will be easier to control. So if this happens, don't be too weird.”





	At first glance it was caution to the fact that the one who was still an enemy, cannot be forced to be an ally. However, Balance said the word "weird" which could include a secret meaning that Lina may experience certain feelings for Tatsuya.





	Apparently, Balance called Lina here, because it seemed necessary to warn her that she did not show such behavior, which would lead to distrust of her, because she had previously personally met with Tatsuya.





	“— ... Okay. Roger that.”





	“Yes, well, think about it.”





	“It's a good thing we talked about this,” Balance thought, seeing the confused face of the unreliable Lina.





	After Balance, Lina and Canopus came out of the Commander's office. After a while Colonel Walker summoned the commanders of the Third and Fourth Corps of Stars, Arcturus and Vega.





	“Captain Alexander Arcturus arrived.”





	“Captain Charlotte Vega has arrived.”





	“Enter.”

	Walker invited the two unit commanders to the Office of the base Commander.





	Like they said, they were both captains. Their ranks were lower than Lina and Canopus, but in the current form of the organization of Stars it was strange that there were six people of the same rank as Lina, who was considered the Commander-in-Chief. So in a sense it was normal that the commanders of Arcturus and Vega were lower in rank than the Commander-in-Chief Lina.





	However, Vega, who was older than Lina by more than 10 years, was extremely unhappy with the fact that she was below her in rank. That's why Vega and Lina got along badly. More precisely, Vega was unilaterally hostile to Lina, who was younger than her.





	Arcturus did not manifest hostility and disobedience to Lina. But they could not be called friends.





	First Lieutenant Fomalhaut, executed... Killed by Lina the day before Christmas Eve last year, and was a member of the Third Corps, which is led by Captain Arcturus.





	Arcturus understood that Fomalhaut, who had committed mass murders, using his "superpower", pyrokinesis, deserved punishment. However, it was also true that he did not have the opportunity to defend himself in a military court.





	For Arcturus it was unpleasant to think that Lina had no other choice but to shoot Fomalhaut on the spot, though he resisted.





	There was no doubt that Walker chose these two, because there was a psychological distance between them and Lina from Canopus.





	“It is absolutely forbidden to tell anyone about the mission you are about to receive. Commander, also do not report this to Major Sirius.”





	“You got it, sir.”





	When they simultaneously responded to the order of the Commander, Arcturus with doubt frowned his eyebrows, and the eyes of Vega shone. She was delighted to be able to circumvent Lina. It was possible to call this behavior unworthy of her age, in fact magicians usually are not inclined to be envious on such an occasion.





	Walker knew about the personal feelings of Vega, but did not rebuke her, but moved on to the story of the mission.





“Create a stir at the construction of the energy plant, designed by the Japanese Strategic Class Magician, Shiba Tatsuya. One of the means of obstruction can be considered the murder of Shiba Tatsuya.”





	Arcturus opened his eyes wide with unconcealed surprise.





	“Is this an order for me and Captain Vega to kill Shiba Tatsuya?”





	“The main task is to hinder his project. If this goal can be achieved, then killing will not be necessary.”





	“Is it possible to resort to murder if obstruction is difficult?” Vega asked immediately. ... With a smile on her face.”





	“— from the moment of receiving the temporary name "The Great Bomber", the initial plan concerning this magic of conversion of mass into energy consisted in complete neutralization if it could not be seized. Nothing has changed here. Now the priority is given to neutralization through Project Dione, and if this does not work, we will return to the original plan.”





	“You got it.”





	Arcturus was still in a state of reluctance, but he persuaded himself to accept the task.





Vega, on the contrary, was full of enthusiasm.





	Through the Women's Information network for soldiers and officers, she found out that Lina seems to be friends with Tatsuya. Although it is still "potential", but he is still "the greatest threat". Those who are close friends with the "greatest enemy" should not be a soldier of the USNA army.





	She, as a sempai, will wake Sirius up, bringing her the head of Shiba Tatsuya. With such thoughts, Vega was burning with enthusiasm.





	The murder of the first Lieutenant Alfred Fomalhaut left a mark in the hearts of every member of the Stars. The execution of their First-Class companion also left unpleasant feelings among all the Stars. Especially in the same Third Corps as Fomalhaut and his close friend, the First Lieutenant, Jacob Regulus, who is still searching for the truth about the incident.





	At the moment, the official but absolutely secret opinion is that the murders Fomalhaut committed were under the control of a parasite. Psychological resistance to the supernatural was lost with the practical use of magic, and at the autopsy of Fomalhaut in his brain, they found a body that should not be in a human. Any who calls themselves realists, will find it difficult to deny the existence of parasites.





	He was captured by the parasite and created disorder, using his unique ability of pyrokinesis. This was explained by his multiple murders of civilians in that incident. But it wasn't enough to convince Regulus.





	How was Fomalhaut was captured by a parasite?





	Shortly before the incident, Fomalhaut was sent to a solitary mission. Until the moment they last saw him, there was no strangeness in him. So they were undoubtedly captured during that solitary mission.





	The question is when, where and who did it.





	If it is an accident, it is necessary to find out the conditions of occurrence of parasites and to prevent recurrence of it.





	Many scientists are actively working in this direction.





	Although this theory was deadlocked because of the inability to test it to confirm it, but most believed that the reason is the Micro Black Hole experiment. Disputes about the mechanism of this process are still going on.





	Therefore, Regulus conducted an investigation to prove that the emergence of parasites was not an accident.





	Who called the parasite that got to Fomalhaut?

	If it was a deliberate incident, it was a brutal terrorist attack that could lead to large-scale losses that terrorized the USNA. Because the magician, who alone carries a fighting power comparable to a battalion, can itself be regarded as an instrument of terrorism.





	His friend was used as a terrorist or a saboteur, and as a result he was executed by the hands of his own friends.





	Regulus could not close his eyes to the possibility of this. Despite the fact that further investigation after the execution of the offender was not the work of the Stars, Regulus continued to investigate, and spent his free time and days off.





However, one and a half years after the incident, Regulus was more and more inclined to the conclusion that "There were no criminals". It happened by accident.





	And now, when he was almost convinced, he was delivered this information.





	“What does it mean...”





	The fact that Regulus unconsciously muttered this aloud, had a reason.





	This anonymous email had passed through the highest level of security, which is used even in the general staff, and has reached his terminal in a state without any censorship.





	According to the Charter, Regulus had to isolate the message in the system and notify the security personnel. But he did not, and opened the letter.





The intuition of Regulus whispered to him that he should read it and not give it to others to read.





	The letter was not encrypted. It seems to have been protected from peeping by other means than encryption.





	And something absolutely amazing was written in it.

	“The experiment of the Micro Black Hole is the work of a Japanese agent...!?”





	In this letter it says following:



	 	· The Micro Black Hole Experiment was started by a Japanese Private magician organization.





	 	· The aforementioned organization knew that this experiment could cause





	"something" spiritual to happen.





	 	· The organization was looking for a country to conduct the experiment that could not be implemented in Japan.





	 	· At that time, scientists from the USNA army, who actively sought hints on the magic of converting mass into energy, engaged in similar research.





	 	· The aforementioned organization wished to receive even more experimental data. They asked for another micro black hole experiment that would be monitored by an organization agent.





	 	· Fomalhaut was captured by a parasite because he was suddenly attacked. If a magician has a solid consciousness and a strong goal, the parasite will never be able to possess them.





	Regulus didn't believe the contents of this letter. To be honest, it seemed too "suspicious" to him .





	In particular, he thought that is too convenient that it is possible to avoid the parasite from taking over by only having a strong consciousness.





	But the fact that the experiment was conducted on the advice of a foreign agent, unconsciously touched him to the bottom of the soul.





	The details of the experiment seemed unnatural. Not only among scientists, but also among politicians there are many who adhere to the rule of caution. The results were doubtful from the very beginning. Among the scholars, only the minority believed that the magic of mass conversion to energy could be explained by Hawking's radiation.





	Regulus also wanted to see if there was any chance that these events were too much for him to understand, like some sort of conspiracy theory. But if we consider that the Micro Black Hole experiment could be intervened by an external force, it looks like a reasonable explanation for why the experiment was conducted at that time.





	Regulus could not decide whether this external force was the Japanese civil organization of magicians, the "Ten Master Clans". Regulus warned himself that he should not be influenced by a message whose sender wished to remain unknown. But now that his investigation was stalled, and if there is an opportunity to learn the truth, he began to think that it would be a good idea to try.





	If they try the experiment again, you can check whether the source of parasites is really the Micro Black Hole. Then it will also become clear if what is written in this letter is true. If this is true, there will be a chance to grab the tail of a criminal group.





	However, there was a risk that new victims could appear, and be captured by parasites. But if they are the same as they are, magicians of the Star Class, then they may be able to capture the parasites or destroy them.





	There was no reason not to try.





	This was the conclusion that Regulus came to. At this point, he did not even think that he could capture a parasite.





Regulus approached his immediate commander, Captain Arcturus, with an offer to

experiment with the Micro Black Hole, the moment after Arcturus returned from his visit to Colonel Walker.





	Regulus told him the contents of the letter truthfully and eloquently proved the necessity of the experiment.





	If it were any other day, it would have ended only by the fact that Arcturus would simply rebuke that Regulus was being reckless.





	But Arcturus was mentally unstable after receiving Walker's assignment.





	He was attracted by the idea of being able to grasp the Japanese agent's tail.



	If they receive important material for negotiations with Japan, it may be possible to neutralize the Strategic Class Magic "Material Burst" and without such dirty methods as murder. Such a naïve calculation arose in Arcturus’ mind.





	Arcturus turned back in the direction of the base Commander's office and led Regulus there.





	And somehow, Regulus was able to persuade Colonel Walker.





	Perhaps the Colonel just wanted to sabotage the mission entrusted to him by the chief of staff.





	He immediately contacted the General Staff, and in the course of the conversation, they came to the decision that for the repetition of the Micro Black Hole experiment, he will be contacted later.





	Chapter 7





	On Wednesday after school, Tomitsuka Hagane visited the School Council Room. Even Igarashi Yousuke, Chairman of the Club Management Group, rarely came to the School Council Room, and Tomitsuka’s appearance here in general was an exceptional case.





	“— When is Tatsuya planning to start attending school?”



	“Unfortunately, he didn't tell me about that.” With reluctance on her face, Miyuki answered the question of Tomitsuka, the meaning of which was something like: “When is the next time Tatsuya is to come?”.





	Her answer was not a lie, and her facial expression wasn’t an act.





	For a while, Tatsuya will not go to school, because he is observing how the situation changes after the press conference. The resumption of school attendance depends on this situation in society, and Tatsuya himself cannot in advance say, "from what moment" he will return.





	And Miyuki, day after night, grew discontent that Tatsuya was not free to come to school.





	“Then... Will you tell me where Shiba-kun is right now?” With unconcealed despair, Tomitsuka asked Miyuki the next question.





	“Do you have something to discuss with Tatsuya?” Miyuki asked this answer with a suspicious voice. Anyone in her place felt that something was wrong with Tomitsuka.





	There was no freedom of action in his behavior. Putting pressure on the interlocutor with his circumstances was not like Tomitsuka.





	“Excuse me.”





	However, he noticed that he was making Miyuki feel unpleasant.





	“Um... There's something I'd like to talk to Shiba-kun about.”

	“Talk? If you don't mind, I'd like to know about what?”





	Tomitsuka’s eyes ran from side to side. He hesitated for a while, but eventually he overcame his indecision and met Miyuki with a look.





	“My mother is hospitalized.”





	“Your Mother!”





	Miyuki opened her eyes wide and covered her mouth with her hand. Tomitsuka was fussing from such a reaction.





	“Oh, no, even though I said she was hospitalized, there's no danger for her life. She has a severe stomach ulcer.. she will be discharged from the hospital after a month of rest.”





	“I understood... I hope she has a quick recovery.”





	“Thank you very much.”





	Thanking Miyuki for her words of sympathy, Tomitsuka looked as if he wanted to say something else. While he was looking for the words to say, Izumi spoke to him.





	“Isn’t Tomitsuka-sempai’s mother the chairman of the Magic Association?”





	“Yes, she is, Saegusa-san.”





	“Does your mother's illness have a psychological origin?”





	This time Tomitsuka’s eyes were already wide open.





	“... The doctor said it was caused by stress.”





“In other words, Tomitsuka-sempai wants to say that the cause of his mother's illness, is Shiba-sempai?”





	“I wasn't going to say something like that!”





	The face of the answering Tomitsuka blushed. This proved that Izumi's assertion was not entirely wrong. Tomitsuka, who was worried, realized, and took a deep breath.





	“— ... Your mother has recently been severely pressured by the government. With regards to Tatsuya-sama?” Miyuki asked Tomitsuka imperturbably.





	“Yes, that's right. They want her to persuade Shiba-kun to cancel the energy plant project and take part in Project Dione...”

	“— what does that mean!” Honoka said loud and indignant. Izumi and Shiina, also considering it absurd, sent cold gazes to Tomitsuka.





	“Can you talk about something like that? Don't you have to keep it a secret?”





	“— ... A member of my family already went to the hospital, though unofficially. And as long as it’s for my family and to the extent that it will help the people involved in the case to identify the circumstances, it will not be a problem.”





	The open tone of Tomitsuka’s voice showed his discontent with "government-related people."





	“I'm not going to accuse Shiba-kun of my mother's hospitalization. Even I understand that it is ridiculous to shift the responsibility to Shiba-kun.”





	“Tomitsuka-Sempai. If you aren’t going to complain, what are you going to talk about with Shiba-sempai?”





	Miyuki’s question again was voiced aloud by Izumi.





	“— Regardless of the Government's opinion, I believe that Shiba-kun should take part in Project Dione. This is undoubtedly an important project for the future of mankind, and the USNA is trying to invite Shiba-kun with the most courteous attitude.

He may have had a lot of plans, but I believe that for Japan, for the sake of the Japanese magicians, he must accept the invitation of the USNA. So far, I was silent because it didn't concern me, but when it affected my family, I became involved.





	There was no one among the members of the School Council who would support the argument of Tomitsuka. But there also were none that interrupted his speech.





	“Although I am annoyed that I have to follow unreasonable government requests, I still want to try to persuade Shiba-kun to take part in Project Dione.”





	Making sure that Tomitsuka finished his speech, Miyuki spoke.





	“If that is your goal, then I can't tell you anything.”





	“Huh..?”





	Tomitsuka, it seems, did not expect a refusal. He stared at Miyuki like a person expressing their complete misunderstanding of an answer.





	“If you have such a goal, I can't afford to tell you the address of Tatsuya.”





	“Why... Can I ask why...?” “Because I understand that you want to stop Tatsuya, and I can't help you with that.”





	The face of Tomitsuka distorted, as if to say "I can't believe it".





	"But... The selfishness of Shiba-kun can bring problems to everyone else! If Shiba-kun shows a little patience, everyone will end up better!”





	“Selfishness, you say...?”





	Miyuki did not even concealed that she was unpleasantly surprised.





“Tomitsuka-kun, it looks like you're confused about your mom getting sick. Please, forget today. It will be better for everyone.”





	The usual Tomitsuka is completely different and would not say anything smug. Miyuki knew this and wanted to solve the problem peacefully. For her, it was an exceptional occasion when Tatsuya was offended, and she ended it all with reasonable measures. Her magic did not get out of control because the seal was removed, and she thus regained the primordial control of her magic. However, to her opponent, feeling like he got pushed into a corner, and trapped in his thinking, it produced a reverse effect.





	“— ... President Shiba. I'm challenging you to a duel.”





	“Under a duel you mean a fight for resolving the conflict of opinions?”





	“Yes. If I win, please tell me where the Shiba-kun is.”





	Miyuki quietly listened to the willful statement of Tomitsuka. No, she was completely calm. But there was no blazing anger inside her, because those hostile and murderous intentions were frozen.





	“— ... I accept your challenge”.





	“Miyuki-sama, please wait.”





	The phrase of the acceptance of the duel was blocked by another voice.





	"Minami-chan?"





	With a mixed sense of wonder and suspicion, Miyuki asked about Minami’s intentions.





	Minami did not say "President", but "Miyuki-sama".





	The fact that Miyuki is the successor of the title the "Head of the Yotsuba family" was well-known. At the same time, everyone here understood that Minami is not really a cousin, but is in the service of the Yotsuba family. Nobody really asked about it, but everyone suspected this kind of a relationship.





	Therefore, Minami called Miyuki "Miyuki-sama", without feeling any discomfort. She said, "Miyuki-sama", in cases where Miyuki wasn't around. However, Miyuki did not like it when it happened at school, and she insisted on the greatest possible deterrence of this behavior, showing their relationship as a master and a servant.





	So she had to have some reason for saying "Miyuki-sama" in this place, showing the behavior of a servant in the presence of their kohai.





	“Tatsuya-sama told me to protect Miyuki-sama. Followed with Tatsuya-sama giving me his trust, I cannot allow Miyuki-sama to participate in unnecessary battles.”





	Miyuki had nothing to object the words of Minami. When Tatsuya’s intentions are mentioned, Miyuki cannot have any objections.





	“But in that case, Tomitsuka-sempai maybe will not be satisfied? That instead of Miyuki-sama, I will become the opponent of Tomitsuka-sempai.”





	“— ... I got it. Tomitsuka-kun, is that fine with you? If Minami-chan loses, then like you, Tomitsuka-kun, asked, I will tell you the location of the villa, where Tatsuya-sama now lives.”





	“— ... If it results in you telling me the location of Shiba-kun, then I do not mind.”





	These unexpected developments puzzled Tomitsuka. Perhaps more precisely it could be said that he was not good in such matters.





	But he decided not to object. He didn't have time to worry about anything but his goal.





	In disputes between students the one who is right and who is wrong, is proven by force. This was the one way of solving problems that was officially included in the rules of First High.





	Of course, the "mock battle" procedure was strictly defined, and it was also required to obtain permission from the President of the School Board and the Head of the Disciplinary Committee.





	It was a measure to prevent the use of training fights for unilateral violence, so when there is a large difference in force between the participants.





“— ... I thought there wouldn't be a duel against the Student Council this year.”





	The Head of the Disciplinary Committee Mikihiko complained to Izumi, who came to ask for approval of the mock battle. Since the President is the related party this time, the organization of the mock fight is handled by the Vice President, Izumi.





	“This is not a duel, but a match, Yoshida-sempai.”





	Having made a small amendment to the words of Mikihiko, Izumi gave him the approved resolution of the Student Council together with its written form.





	Seeing what it says, Mikihiko rounded his eyes with surprise.





	“Hand to Hand combat!? Is that okay? I mean, the fight is between Tomitsuka-kun and Sakurai-san, a guy and a girl?





	Usually, hand to hand combat for competitions was only used by guys. Because sexual harassment is a possibility in a fight between a guy and a girl.





	“The “Using a mock knife and stopping before hitting the opponent”-rule. Sakurai-san seems to be sure of herself.”





	The explanation of Izumi did not calm Mikihiko at all. Even if it is said that the end of match is determined by the simulation of the impact of the mock knife, it still means that punching and kicking is allowed.

	“— ... I will serve as the referee.”





	He could not simply put his seal of approval on this, thinking that he could not leave a place unattended where a pupil could be injured by another pupil. With this thought in mind, Mikihiko decided to be the referee.





	Tomitsuka, who changed into a club uniform and waited in the third room for practical training, looked with round eyes at the appearance of Minami, who entered the room after Miyuki.





	“Are you going to participate in the match in that outfit!?”





	"But it doesn't violate the rules.” Minami answered with an indifferent tone to the involuntarily screaming Tomitsuka.





“That is... so, but..”





	Tomitsuka was in the uniform for Magic Martial Arts.





	The upper part is a long sleeve shirt without buttons with cushions on the elbow parts, then loose beltless trousers whose cushions were on the knee parts and only the part at the ankle is tightened. On his feet, he wore soft shoes that were designed for martial arts sports.





	On the other hand, Minami was in a T-shirt with short sleeves and in short thigh shorts worn by gymnasts. Although her right thigh was covered with a weapon belt with an attached mock knife, she still had the usual appearance of an athlete with exposed arms and legs.





	“Are you worried about injuries?”





	Tomitsuka was speechless towards Minami who just spoke to him.





	“Of course, if you receive a blow from Tomitsuka-sempai, you can get a bump or a bruise. Maybe even a fracture.”

	“In that case... You need more protection.” Tomitsuka wanted to say.





	“Tomitsuka-sempai. This is the essence of the mock battle.”





	But Minami was faster than him.





	“Even with the rules, when close combat is forbidden, the danger of being traumatized does not change much.”





	In a rare occurrence, Minami was quite talkative today.





	“If Tomitsuka-senpai doesn’t mind being injured by girls, he would have already lost this match today.”





	Minami intentionally made a short pause.





“At your own convenience.”





She struck down these condemning words on Tomitsuka. He could not object to Minami’s criticism .





	“— ... Tomitsuka-kun, do you want to cancel the match?” Mikihiko turned to the dumbfounded Tomitsuka.

“Even if you win or lose this match, you will only have a poor aftertaste left, so it’s better to stop now and you will not regret it.”



	Mikihiko extended Tomitsuka a life line.





	“— ... Yoshida-kun, give the signal for the beginning of the match.”





	But the concern of Mikihiko only reinforced the stubbornness of Tomitsuka. Now Tomitsuka definitely needed to know the address of Tatsuya.





	When Mikihiko mentioned "regret", Tomitsuka thought that "I do not want to withdraw here and regret it later, even if I injure a girl and end up regretting it".





	“— ... Got it. Both parties know the rules? The rule is to stop before making contact Please obey the judgement of the referee.”





	Tomitsuka and Minami simultaneously nodded. Unfortunately for Mikihiko, neither Tomitsuka nor Minami had shown that they want to retreat.





	“Then... Start!”





	By the signal of Mikihiko, Tomitsuka and Minami simultaneously activated magic.





	To reduce the distance, oscillation magic is used to break the balance of the enemy and get victory without injuring her... This plan, invented by Tomitsuka for this fight, was stopped by an Anti-Object barrier, which appeared directly in front of him.





	Although Tomitsuka already saw the ability of Minami in last year's "Stellar Furnace" experiment and at the Nine Schools Competition, could still be surprised at the activation speed of her magic. The barrier preventing his approach was created the moment after the signal for the beginning of the match.





	With surprise, but without panic, Tomitsuka flew into this transparent wall.





	His disadvantage that he could not project psions at a distance from his body, has not changed. For magic that was able to attack the enemies from far away, it only affects the influence of magic that was invoked nearby into the continuous space, so a magic can be set on a remote location.





	But the peculiarity of wearing high-density psion armor, which can neutralize any magic touching his body, also has not changed. No, this ability to neutralize magic, which can be called "Contact-Type Gram Demolition", has became stronger because of his improved psion control.





	Tomitsuka’s shoulder pierced the magical barrier of Minami. Resistance was felt less than one second. After that, Tomitsuka felt that the barrier that was unseen by the naked eye, collapsed.





	Next he was going to hit Minami with his hand. However, in the time when Tomitsuka was focused on the barrier, Minami had the time to go flank him from the side.





	The installation location of the magic barrier can be specified as either relative or absolute coordinates.





	When setting the barrier by absolute coordinates in the true sense of the word, it is necessary to take into account the huge speed of rotation of the Earth and its orbital movement, so, even when they say "absolute coordinates", in most cases it means a relative position based on the coordinates on the Earth's surface. In human perception it can be expressed as absolute coordinates. ... Many people know that the magic that sets a wall using the true absolute coordinates, so that the enemy at breakneck speed flew into it, is an extremely advanced type of attacking magic.





	At the moment, Minami has created barriers in the usual sense of the concept of absolute coordinates. On the other hand, Tomitsuka acted with prejudice that the enemy is on the other side of the barrier. For this reason, he lost sight of Minami at the time of the destruction of the barrier.





	Minami released a compressed air bullet which can be said to be a basic version of attacking magic to Tomitsuka.





	The modified “Sakurai” series has a high aptitude for magic barriers, and the second generation Minami is particularly talented.





	But it does mean that she, like Tatsuya or Tomitsuka, was bad at using other spells, that weren’t related to her specialization.





	Besides that, compressed air bullet “in a compressed state” conceptually has some compatibly with barrier magic, so it is an easy magic for Minami to use. It is synonymous with “magic” which can “give great power”.





	Perhaps because the degree of threat was high, this intuition of his payed off.



	Driven by a strong sense of danger, Tomitsuka created a magical barrier in the form of armor.





	Tomitsuka could activate magic on objects or areas in his direct physical contact.





	However, at a distance of zero meters in the Contact State, the "Range Zero", it demonstrated an unparalleled force. Such a magician was Tomitsuka Hagane.





	Unlike Fortification magic, this Anti-Object barrier, activated a form that overlapped his worn clothing, and was able to take the compressed air bullet from Minami. The armor Tomitsuka created protected him from both the compressed air, and from the explosion caused by the release of the compressed condition.





	Tomitsuka continued by activating Movement-Type Magic.





	To move his own body using magic is the basis for his favorite technique, "Self-Marionette". Due to his possession of this skill, he was able to jump to Minami with such speed, that she could not prepare her next attacking magic.





	As soon as his feet felt contact with the floor, Tomitsuka pulled his right hand to the right. From this position he consistently took a step forward with his right foot and thrust his right palm.





	But Tomitsuka’s arms and legs stopped moving due to the unexpected scene that caught his eye.





	On the face of the suddenly attacking Minami, excitement appeared. From her position, she was happy that Tomitsuka suddenly appeared before her, ignoring the distance between them.





	She managed to avoid the attack of Tomitsuka thanks to her reflexes, cultivated through training in the Yotsuba main house.





	At the same time as Tomitsuka, she entered the position to prepare a blow to the chest, she bent her back backwards and pushed herself away from the floor.





	Because of the backflip that happened in front of his eyes, Tomitsuka’s attack missed.





	No, the delay in his movements wasn’t caused by the surprising back flip, but because his gaze caught a piece of bodily color, that appeared after the bottom edge of the T-shirt was lifted.





	At least Minami felt Tomitsuka’s eyes were directed towards her because she took her distance.





	Instead of feeling disgusted, Minami thought that it was the only thing that saved her.





	It was a opening that could lead to the end of the mock battle, if Tomitsuka hadn’t created a gap.





	There is no way you can miss seeing the satisfactory belly button.





	“If the enemy were Tatsuya-sama, this fight would have already stopped" Even though she pushed her palm of the floor and thrust back by backflipping, she could not find the next attacking posture immediately after she landed.





If she attacked Tatsuya, this situation would be hopeless. And if this was Tatsuya, he would have not stop the attack just because he saw the naked skin of a woman.





	Minami jumped further to the side and created a new magic barrier.





	Tomitsuka recovered from his rigidity and approached Minami quickly.





	Destroying the barriers.





	Until that moment, everything happened the same as it did the last time. However, Minami did not come from the flank this time, but instead retreated to the back.





	When the shield was destroyed, she built the next shield.





	Tatsuya’s demolition magic, if it was Gram Demolition, the destruction of magic



	would only take a moment. Magic Sequences displayed in the information dimension cannot resist "Gram Demolition", which decomposes Psion information bodies.





	But Gram Demolition [spell dismantling] is a technique to blow away Magic Sequences attached to the Eidos using psion pressure. Depending on the force with which the Magic Sequence is stuck to the Eidos, there is a delay in time until the dismantling occurs.





	Area Magic that fixes the Magic Sequence in a space without anything is usually weak against Gram Demolition. But the barrier magic of Minami was far from "ordinary". The "Sakurai" series’ Anti-Object barrier, which can withstand a tremendous amounts of momentum, was extremely powerful in the concept of "holding something". Minami has also inherited these magical characteristics.





	In other words, the magical barriers of Minami can withstand Gram Demolition for a short amount of time. Even if he will eventually break through, it also means that it can give you time to prepare your next magic.





	Minami’s Anti-Object barrier are used to stop Tomitsuka’s advancements. The barrier was quickly destroyed, but it took about one second. During this time, Minami retreated back and had finished erecting her next barrier.



	It could be called a pseudo Phalanx.





But it does not mean that Minami does not feel anything from the broken barriers. The fatigue caused by the activation of magic is undoubtedly accumulating.





	But Minami gradually receded back, making sure that there was a small gap between each barrier, so that the Psion armor around Tomitsuka could not touch them at the same time.





	Tomitsuka could quickly destroy these barriers, so he did not move out of the way, but progressed forward. Gradually moving, almost as if he were standing still, if looked at from the outside.





	This was not Tomitsuka’s original style. Facing his troubles directly, using his coordinated hand and foot work, was his way of fighting. But Tomitsuka could not do this when these struggles made his legs immobilized and he is required to grab or push his opponent like you would in sumo wrestling or rugby.





	Minami retreated diagonally across the practical training room. Looking at the distance left between the walls and her left and right, Minami realized she was approaching the corner of the room.





	She did not miss the moment when Tomitsuka’s eyes were looking behind her.





	"... I drove her into the corner," Minima could clearly read Tomitsuka’s thoughts.





	Two more steps, and she's into the corner. There will be no further retreat.





Simultaneously with the destruction of her barrier, Minami took one big step back instead of two ordinary ones.





	Without building another barrier.





	Leaning forward to destroy the next barrier, Tomitsuka’s body lost stability.





A disadvantage of Contact-Type Gram Demolition is that it can’t demolish magic without physically touching it. This created a convenient opportunity for Minami because Tomitsuka was careless, since he was obsessed with destroying the barriers.





	Minami, taking advantage of this moment, activated the prepared magic.





A downward Whirlwind.





	This magic only created a downward air flow centered around the user, and had a lack of killing power. However, Tomitsuka, who had been approaching Minami the entire time, was caught in the air current and lost his positioning.





	Minami wrapped herself around Tomitsuka’s back, grabbed his mock knife and threw it away.





	Tomitsuka’s face blushed, which definitely wasn’t just because he was nervous. Through the thin fabric of the gymnastic clothing a "soft feeling" was impossible not to be felt. But luckily for Tomitsuka, Minami did not notice his embarrassment.





	Hooking his leg from the inside, Minami threw Tomitsuka forward.





	Tomitsuka tried to use rotational movement to shake Minami off, but she, skillfully shifting her weight around, hung on to Tomitsuka’s body, thus throwing him on the ground.





	Tomitsuka was under her.





	As a result, Minami sat on Tomitsuka’s back, "like a horse", snatched the mock knife from her waist, and put it to Tomitsuka’s throat.





	“The match is over! Sakurai-san wins!” Mikihiko announced when the training match was completed.





	If the knife were real, it would mean that Tomitsuka’s throat would have been cut by Minami. The outcome of the fight was obvious to all.





	When they finished with cleaning and formalities after the mock fight, it was almost time to close the school gates. Miyuki and the rest, having finished their Student Council work, merged with the group of Erika and Leo and they finally all gathered in the usual café.





	“Hey, Sakurai-san, you were so strong.”





	“No, I was just lucky today...” Minami shyly tried to deny the words of Kasumi.





	The interest of all present was focused on the past mock fight.





	“I guess luck will always be involved, but without true strength, you wouldn’t’ve been

	able to win against Tomitsuka-kun.” Erika intervened with a face that showed that there was nothing to be surprised about.





“Erika, did you know about the Sakurai’s real power?”





	The one asking was Leo, because he was a member of the same mountaineering club as Minami and her physical ability was already well known to him. However, according to the idiom “don’t judge a book by its cover”, the impression that people got from Minami is that she usually is a “gentle girl” and because her muscles aren’t obtrusive, her superb motor functions also cannot be seen. If anything, it’s better to say that she shows the figure of a girl who doesn’t regularly exercise.





	Therefore for Leo, this was unexpected behavior for Erika as if she had long been aware of Minami’s power.





	“It’s difficult to understand unless you train enough. If you look carefully, you'll notice that this is the case.”





	“— Is that so…?”





	I wonder who Leo was more impressed by, Erika or Minami? Or maybe both.





	“But I heard she's not very good at physical education.”





	Izumi did not have much malice when she asked Minami this simple question.





	“I... am not very good at ball games...”





	Answering seriously about her shortcomings, Minami looked a bit embarrassed. Izumi, who is also not that good at physical education, (It’s not that they can’t do it, but they’re just psychologically bad at it) stopped questioning Minami.





	“But I think, like Sakurai-san said, the result was not only because of her abilities.”





	Apparently, thinking that too much praise is also bad, Mikihiko changed the direction of the conversation.





	“It seems that Tomitsuka-kun was quite uncomfortable.”





	“Because his opponent was a girl?”





	Mikihiko nodded to the question of Shizuku.





	“Choosing hand to hand combat may have been a mistake.”





	“Do you mean that it would’ve been better if they only fought with magic?” Saburou, who did not knowing about Tomitsuka, expressed his doubts about the words of Mikihiko.





“Because of Tomitsuka’s special magic, he can't do it.” Shiina immediately gave him this answer.





	Next, Shiina explained the meaning of Tomitsuka’s nickname "Range Zero" to Saburou, and Honoka accused Tomitsuka: “If that happened, it would’ve been better to stop.”





	“But he really liked it, didn't he?”





	Even though Shizuku was making a bad joke, it sounded serious because of her voice.





	“By the way, Tomitsuka-kun seems to have been fascinated by Minami-chan’s belly button...”





	“Honoka, details" Shizuku poured oil onto the fire before Minami could stop Honoka.





	“Minami-chan was wearing gymnastic sports uniform.”





	“How bold.”





	“Well, that's it. Minami-chan made a backflip to avoid Tomitsuka-kun’s attack.”





	“Wow.”





	“— At that moment, the edge of her shirt was fluttering, exposing a rather large area of her stomach. Of course, it was quickly concealed again, but Tomitsuka-kun froze for a while, motionless staring at Minami-chan’s belly button.”





	“Guilty.” Shizuku decided without hesitation, after hearing this story.





	“And his face became red when Minami-chan grabbed him from behind...”

“Really!?” Minami cried out when she heard Honoka’s additional testimony.





	“Yes. I guess... It was because your chest was touching him.”





	“— ...”





	From the shame, Minami hid her face behind her hands. Leo and Mikihiko also blushed a little and quickly turned their face.





	“Hmm... Was the gymnastic uniform for this purpose?” Erika had no mercy for her shy junior





	“Minami-chan wanted Tomitsuka-kun to cancel the mock fight.”





	Minami was still unable to answer, and Miyuki voiced her idea instead.





“Originally, Tomitsuka-kun asked for a fight with me.”
