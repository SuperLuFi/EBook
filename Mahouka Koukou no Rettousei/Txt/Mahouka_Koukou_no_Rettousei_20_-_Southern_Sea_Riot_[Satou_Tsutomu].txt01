	- After improvement, I think it can be used by someone else besides me.

	- Does this mean that at last magic will appear, that in a real sense can neutralize magicians? I'll wait for it.

	"I will make every effort to reach practical application as soon as possible."

	- The magic of the Great Asian Alliance was also very interesting. I'd like to receive a detailed report directly, so go to the main house when you return to Tokyo.

	- Good. Then we leave immediately.

	"Ara, do not hurry. Rest there for a couple of days, regain strength, before returning. You can come with a report in April.

	"Thank you."

	- I look forward to our meeting next month.

	After these words, the connection was interrupted. Bowed before the camera, Tatsuya, making sure that the call indicator went out, raised his head.

	Tatsuya slightly stretched. Despite the success of the operation, the conversation with Maya greatly exhausted him. To freshen up, he left the cabin on deck. There, Miyuki, accompanied by Minami, watched the moon.

	"Onii-sama." Have you already finished the conversation with both?

	- Yes. After returning to Tokyo, it will be necessary to report directly. But it was ordered to come only in April.

	"Oh ... Both of you now seem to be busy."

	It seems that Miyuki thought that there would be an order to come with a report as soon as possible. She covered her mouth with one hand and slightly widened her eyes.

	"Perhaps you are right."

	Tatsuya remembered the time when he was assigned this case, then Maya left the main house for a reason unrelated to the Conference of the Main Clans, which was very rare. Perhaps some urgent issue with sponsors was also solved.

	- But then we have a little free time?

	- Exactly.

	Tatsuya stood next to Miyuki. Having understood the atmosphere, Minami disappeared into the cabin. Left alone on the deck, Miyuki came closer to Tatsuya. Still dressed in a dress and with gathered up hair, she gently laid her head on the shoulder of his suit.

	- This time the mission was ... a fun trip.

	"I was having fun too."

	"But next I'd like to go on a trip without a mission." Onii-sama ... Tatsuya-sama.

	- Onii-sama will come down.

	Worrying not to disturb Miyuki's head touching his shoulder, Tatsuya looked at her profile.

	"Onii-sama and Tatsuya-sama." What is better? I'm still ...

	- There is no need to hurry. Time still exists.

	- And the truth. Time still remains ...

	Tatsuya could not read what was on Miyuki's mind, in anticipation of having closed her eyes.



	Epilogue





	In the waiting room for the departure of the airport there are 6 kinds of people.

	People who see off with a smile. People who escort with tears. People who escort with different from the first two persons. Discarding the detailed classification, it will be any exception, except for smiles and tears.

	Similarly, there are three species that are escorted. People who go with a smile. People who go with tears. People who depart with different from the first two persons.

	However, we dare add one more species. People who go home with a tired face.

	There were differences between working and playing, there was a difference between physical and mental exhaustion, but those who now waited for the return airplane had exactly such persons. Even the girls were exhausted.

	March 29. The day after the party on an artificial island near the coast of Kume Island.

	"It was a tiresome trip ..." Naha Sayaka, who came to the airport departure hall, grumbled, leaning both her hands on her suitcase to relieve the load of her own weight. Azusa, who heard her, giggled with restraint. It was like saying "I agree!", Because she could not say aloud the same thing to the invited classmate.

	- True? But was it fun? "But her partner, Kirihara, had a different opinion." He objected with a cheerful expression. The excitement of yesterday's evening has not yet passed. The excitement is not from the party, but from the battle.

	"... So Kirihara-kun was fun?" As a child, who rejoices when getting wet in a puddle.

	Looking at Sayaka with sad eyes, Kirihara immediately looked away. He remembered how she got angry last night for a spoiled suit.

	"Er, that's not because we wanted to play in the water." Hey, Sawaki.

	Sawaki nodded strongly, although he did not understand well what that meant to "hey."

	- Yes. It was a good fight. I am happy that for the first time in a long time I had to give my best.

	In Sawaki, many shots flew from Sayaka and Azusa. However, even if he became a hedgehog with invisible arrows instead of thorns, it looks like Sawaki it did not work at all. At that moment Isori joined in with an apologetic face.

	"Forgive me for all this." You were dragged into these unexpected events ...

	- Oh, no! It is not true! - On Isori's apologizing words, Sayaka quickly waved her head. "I'm sorry to say strange things." Sure, I was having fun.

	- Yes, I understand. - With a smile nodded Isori fussily explained Sayaka. "Everybody is tired of getting into such an incident." I would like to rest another day.

	- I agree! - Kanon reacted to one of the words of Isori.

	- Refuse today's flight and stay one more night! - Accusing his hand in the hand of the groom, Kanon spoiled with a spoiled voice to persuade Isori.

	- Such a reason will not work.

	- Correctly. Although there are still a few days before the ceremony of entering the university, you still need to start preparing in advance. "Has confirmed Azusa's words to Hattori, but Kanon did not seem convinced:

	- Yes, what is there to prepare?

	- By the way, you have already passed the registration for landing? - Ignoring Kanon's objection, Hattori turned to Isori.

	- Exactly. - Answered was Sawaki. He pushed his suitcase toward the check-in counter for landing.

	- Wait! Hey, do not ignore me!

	Followed by Sawaki Hattori, looked back at the protest Kanon:

	- It's not a different country. Maybe we'll come again in the summer?

	- A good idea. Will we go again with this line-up? He responded vigorously to Hattori's words.

	"Uh, I'd like to see Kei and I together." - Kanon immediately expressed discontent.

	"We do not know if the summer holidays will be really free."

	Speaking to the National Academy of Defense Kirihara, entering the same course Sayaka nodded with a disappointed face.

	- It is not necessary to be limited only in the summer of this year, and it is not necessary to be limited in the summer. A chance can be given at any time, because risks are everywhere.

	"Hattori, is this some sort of philosophy?"

	On the hob of Kirihara Hattori with a smile shook his head.

	- It's not entirely in philosophy. Simply words of consolation.

	"I do not understand what you mean."

	"It's like saying that next time you have to do better." - Sawaki, who finished registration, looked around. "Then, next time, let's deal with the problem only on our own."

	- Well, something like this. Smiling, Hattori nodded at Sawaki's words.

	Unlike the group of graduates of First High, which, as planned, flew to Tokyo on the plane the day after the party, a group of current students swam carefree in the morning. The tour of Kumejima, interrupted by the attack of the submarine, was organized anew on the same ship with a transparent bottom.

	- Suddenly it became "not a mission, but a trip". - said Miyuki with a bitter smile.

	- I think this does not count. - Tatsuya also smiled ironically.

	- What do you mean "does not count"? - Immediately asked with curiosity Honoka.

	"The trip to Okinawa this time was a job, so I talked about going out of work next time. "Because there was no need to hide, Tatsuya honestly answered the question of Honoka. In a conversation last night, Miyuki requested that next time he be out of work. It was during their conversation on board a yacht returning from an artificial island to the main island of Okinawa. Since then, only half a day has passed. When it was mentioned that this cruise can be considered a "trip without work," Tatsuya and Miyuki showed bitter smiles, feeling that the conversation last night was continued.

	"Hmm, what do you mean?" - Honoka did not go any further. She, probably, has understood, that questions, like "it is possible if I go with you?" will receive undesirable answers.

	"How long will you stay here?" - Feeling the sufferings of the best friend, Shizuku decided to change the subject, referring to Miyuki.

	"We plan to return to Tokyo tomorrow or the day after tomorrow."

	"There's not much left after all."

	- In fact, we planned to return today's flight. But in the end we had extra time.

	- Hmm ...

	Miyuki did not explain where the extra time came from. Shizuku also did not ask.

	- We will soon have to organize preparations for the opening ceremony.

	- Here's how.

	Since Shizuku is an ordinary member of the disciplinary committee, she needs to participate only in the school events themselves, but there is no need to participate in their training. But Miyuki is the president of the school board. She must participate in a large number of preparations for the ceremony of admission.

	Annually in March, preparations are made for the opening ceremony, various events at the beginning of the year, an acquaintance with the first-graders' representative is being held, etc., but this year Miyuki left Tokyo immediately after the closing ceremony to fulfill something similar to official duties although this was not "official" duties in fact, but were close to this). Most of the preparations were completed before the spring break, but a meeting to prepare the speech before the newcomers had not yet been held.

	- This year, a representative of first-graders - after all, again a girl?

	- Correctly.

	"She's from the Top Ten Clan Clans?"

	- Yes. Flying Siyin-san. The youngest daughter of the Mitsuya family. But we have not met.

	- So this is how it is. That's why you cannot stay longer.

	- Yes. I'm afraid that is it. "When Miyuki said this, not only herself, but Honoka also had a depressed face.

	But not because Tatsuya will also leave when Miyuki goes to Tokyo. Honoka is also in the school board, so she also needs to participate in the preparation for the welcome ceremony. Honoka and Shizuku planned to return to Tokyo on the 31st, but if Miyuki returns on the 30th to prepare for the admission ceremony, they would also have thought about a return flight the same day.

	"... Anyway, let's rest while we're here!" It's a little early in the sea, but why not swim in the hotel pool, where we stayed? It is quite spacious! - Returning motivation Honoka approached Tatsuya. Speaking to her Shizuku thought that from the face of Miyuki, watching this, a bit of calm disappeared.

	The report on the capture of the Japanese army by Jasmine Williams and James J. Johnson reached William MacLeod in Britain in the middle of the following day.

	The incident, with an attempt to sabotage the artificial island in Kumejima, was apparently carried out by a detachment of deserters from the Great Asian Alliance with the support of the Australian army, but in fact it was Britain that organized the two forces together. If the details come to the surface, it will be impossible to avoid revealing that the British army is the culprit.

	Knowing this, the intelligence department of the British army was surrounded by a tense atmosphere. Of course, there was not much noise, as if the hive had been turned over. Even in the building of the headquarters of the military intelligence department in the White Hall (the Government Center of Britain in the business district), this case was not loudly voiced, for fear of information leakage. It was unnecessary to create a depressing atmosphere. Therefore, there was nothing but reproach from the people, by which MacLeod was passing. The staff involved in this operation knew that MacLeod had a leading role in nominating a detachment of magicians of the Australian army.

	MacLeod understood why these reproachful views were aimed at him. He was already asked to explain himself. The fact that his reputation worsened was clear to all. However, William MacLeod did not need to worry about the hostility directed at him. During interrogation by senior officers before government officials, he was treated like an aristocrat, as before.

	First, he expected that the British government would not be negligent towards one of the official magicians of the Strategic Class from the Thirteen Apostles. The fact that he was calm, spoke of confidence in the safety of his position, despite the fact that he was involved in an independent trip to Australia, where he directly supervised the operation.

	MacLeod left the headquarters of the so-called DIS and entered the old building next to the First Block. There was a branch of the government communications headquarters (formerly MI1), which was in charge of the British SigInt (engaged in interception of communications, eavesdropping, interception of radio signals, radar waves, etc.). For passers-by it was completely unclear what this building is, but it was MacLeod's workplace. Roughly speaking, in one of the rooms adjacent to the GCHQ building Macleod had a private office.

	Not meeting anyone on the way, he went into his office and locked the door. In general, there were people walking back and forth through the building, but MacLeod's office was on a technical floor, where ordinary employees usually did not go. And access to the office itself was hidden from the rest with the help of a dedicated elevator.

	MacLeod included the most modern communication terminal, incompatible with the appearance of the old building. A figure of one man immediately appeared on the display. Apparently, the interlocutor approached his terminal before the appointed time.

	"Hello, Sir William MacLeod." How is your health?

	- Hello, Dr. Clark. Health is normal. For my age.

	"I did not mean anything like that ... I'm sorry."

	- No, sorry for being rude. This was just a joke.

	The name of the man, smiling puzzled from the terminal screen, was Edward Clark. He is a scientist from the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America and a specialist in large-scale information systems.

	"You are an evil man, sir." By the way, it seems that the question we discussed earlier, as expected, ended in failure.

	"There's nothing to hide from you, Doctor."

	- I apologize. So, the introduction of the "Trojan horse" was successful?

	- Not yet. Jas is caught by Haru Kazama .

	- How? ... And I thought Yotsuba would be interested in getting such a sample.

	"I still think there's still a chance." Because it seems that there is a special connection between the division of Kharu Kazama and Yotsuba.

	- Through the telepathic network of the "Brothers Williams", having the same genetic code, I hope to find out some secrets of Yotsuba.

	- In the case of Jas, you should say "Sister", do you not? Although there is no confidence in the conscious use of telepathy, it has the advantage of being difficult to detect to the enemy. In combination with the "system" of the doctor, the limits in which our eyes and ears can penetrate will increase significantly.

	"Information is what you need to manage the world." Sir William, USNA thank you for your cooperation, regardless of the success or failure of the operation.

	"Thank you." For the prosperity of Britain, Doctor, continue to provide us with your wisdom.

	- Of course. Because we are allies.

	From the screen of the communicator, Edward Clark uttered a friendly farewell "Well, see you soon." Immediately after this, the screen goes out. MacLeod also turned off the communicator, carefully closed it, and left this secret cabinet.



	 ◊ ◊ ◊



	Two days after the incident, an attempt was made to sabotage the artificial island in Kumejima. Maya visited a prestigious residential area near the city center.

	The house looked like an old big mansion. But in fact it was a kind of fortress, which, in addition to the latest security equipment, was protected by a large number of ancient defensive spells.

	The owner of the house was called Todo Aoba. Also known as His Excellency the priest Aoba, he was one of the secret players (also known as Yokai [ghosts, demons]) in the political and business arena of Japan. He was the true owner of the former Fourth Laboratory, and also the Yotsuba sponsor.

	Elder Todo rarely summoned Maya. Although this was called sponsorship, the relationship with the Yotsuba family could not be called a one-sided patronage. In terms of funding, the Yotsuba family can do without the help of Elder Todo.

	The Yotsuba family once won freedom from the army, destroying all workers of the former Fourth Laboratory.

	But before that the army had already deprived the Todo family of power over the Fourth Laboratory.

	That's why Elder Todo and the head of the Yotsuba family still had friendly relations. Just as the Yotsuba family depends on the influence of Elder Todo, so does the strength of the Yotsuba family. Relations of mutual support. Therefore, since Todo called Maya, the problem was really important.

	After a formal welcome, Maya and Todo immediately moved on to the main topic.

	- The day before yesterday in Kumejima you did a good job.

	"Thank you."

	The work to prevent diversion, commissioned by Maya Tatsuya, was the request of Elder Todo.

	"Then you captured magicians from the Australian army."

	- Yes. One of them is an ordinary magician, but the other seems to be a very interesting specimen.

	- And there is. "Elder Todo nodded at Maya's words. - It is natural for you to be interested. But never bring this person to the heart of Yotsuba.

	Hearing the words of the elder, Maya slightly rounded her eyes.

	"Ara ... Is it a trap?" Like a living bomb?

	"It's worse than a bomb." This woman is "ears".

	Despite the abstract way of expressing the elders of Todo, Maya accurately realized that "ears" is a person with a special intelligence ability.

	- As you wish. I will ask Ms. Saeki to get rid of this person immediately. "Maya did not doubt the words of Elder Todo. And she did not ask where he got it from. The Yotsuba family was not the only development of the former Fourth Laboratory. In the organization that preceded the Fourth Laboratory, mating was also practiced. And Elder Todo also had with him those who once offered their "blood" to the Yotsuba family.

	- Correct. It will be much more effective to inform Saeki through you than to simply give the order from here.

	On the orders of Elder Todo, Maya bowed with a heartless smile.



	(The end of the arch "Zavarushka in the South Sea")



	Afterword





	Thank you very much for reading us. How do you like "Smash in the South Sea"? I hope you enjoyed it.



	Initially, it was planned to begin the third year of training in the 20th volume. But for some reason, I had to insert an additional episode, which fit into one volume.

	In this volume, at the development stage, 3 main courses were taken:

	1) Make a separate storyline that is not related to the main story.

	2) Give more activity to characters a year older, who have not received much attention before.

	3) The situation is a graduation trip to Hokkaido or Okinawa.

	But as a result, it grew into an amazing story that you read. It was possible to show the team work of Hattori and other scenes and situations that fit into the taken courses ...

	Since in the arch of the Tatsuya Grand Clans Conference and others there was a failure, I did not think that success this time would be such an excellent idea. Tatsuya got too comfortable exceptional ability. What will happen if you give him freedom?

	With ordinary enemies, there are no problems anymore. Well, from now on we will face situations where one force does not break. Expect it.

	In the epilogue, we introduced a character who will actively participate in the main story.

	Returning to the original plan, I cannot call this an addition to the plot. But as a result it is good that we managed to present it now.

	Of course, it was only a name and class. Originally it was planned to be called "Fumino", but the idea was abandoned because of the existing "Fumia". Then I came up with "Sino", but this idea died when I remembered that this is the name of the famous heroine of some very famous work. As a result, "Sine" was born. It will receive many characteristic features, so look forward to the next volume.

	Reserves of minerals from the seabed are a reference to the "place" found in 2015 with oil deposits. Also in February 2016, the discovery of a geothermal field in the sea near Okinawa was confirmed. Would it be good if technology progressed forward so that we too could access such places?

	Model artificial island was peeped at the "Aquapolis" at the 1975 International Ocean Fair in Okinawa. Although the scale and structure are completely different.

	Although I myself think that bottom structures are more effective for developing the seabed, I chose a floating island for the convenience of history. I wish I could see the realization of this as long as I'm alive.



	Well, in the next volume, the third year of training will really begin. In the final year of the main character's training, I left a lot of "here it's turning", so read us to the end of the whole series. I'll try my best to make you say "it was interesting."

	So, see you in the next volume No. 21, "The Beginning of the Troubles."
