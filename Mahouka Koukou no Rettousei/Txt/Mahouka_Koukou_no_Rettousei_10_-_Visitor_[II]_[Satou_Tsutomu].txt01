“…This is?”

Considering the shape, the way it was wrapped and what day today was, it was obvious what the thing was, but even so, he couldn’t help asking.

“Oh my, isn’t it exactly what you think it is?”

Underneath the statement, voice and expression that all professed surprise, Mayumi was enjoying herself immensely.

“…Thank you.”

Unfortunately, he did not have an excuse to refuse it.

If it weren’t for the scene just now, he might have gotten by with the cliché “I dont like sweets,” but that did not have any persuasive power after he just accepted a large quantity of chocolate from Subaru and her friends.

There was nothing he could do, so Tatsuya accepted Mayumi’s chocolate.

It was very big.

From how it felt in his hand, it had five times the weight of commercial grade chocolate.

That allowed Tatsuya to take a rough guess that she had used high quality materials for what she was plotting. When and where did I earn your enmity, he thought, but he did not have a single clue to her motive; however,

“Hey, taste it.”

He had anticipated this sort of statement from Mayumi.

“Right now?”

“Yes. I want to hear your impressions.”

He did not say, why didn’t you end your experiment with Hattori-senpai.

That saying anything like that was futile was obvious.

She probably wanted to see what kind of face he made right before her eyes.

I didn’t know she could be so childish… As he thought so, Tatsuya began to unwrap it.

(Well, it’s okay.)

There was a little something he wanted to ask Mayumi about just now. Because she was close to taking the university examinations she was preparing for, her time was limited and he had felt awkward about bothering her; however, if she intended to take the time to use him as a toy then he probably shouldn’t worry about it.

“Then since there is a small matter I want to consult you about, may we change the location?”

He did not want ordinary people to overhear the discussion. Naturally, that was not the only reason he wanted to change the location. Even Tatsuya worried a little about his reputation. Collapsing from eating chocolate could never be called dishonorable, but he did think it was the type of embarrassment that people would bring up forever.

“It would be bad if we’re overheard.”

It seemed that Mayumi quickly understood one of his reasons.

The smile disappeared from her face. The transformation was so abrupt that he almost heard a ping when her expression changed.

“Yes.”

“…Understood. Follow me.”

She spent the time before she replied looking at the information terminal of her phone making arrangements. Perhaps she had pinpointed an empty classroom. A normal student wouldn’t have been able to do it, but it wouldn’t be strange if this upperclassman could do it.

Tatsuya took the box he had been given with him when he got up to pursue Mayumi, who had stood up from her seat.

He felt the gazes of well over ten people, but he had already decided not to worry about things that nothing could be done about.




Mayumi used a disposable key code downloaded through her phone terminal to open the door to the room, which was one of the lounges used for interviews with guardians and merchants. It was not as formal as a reception room, but it still felt awkward to be using it as students.

It wasn’t as if he never thought of asking if it were really okay to use the room, but it was probably too late to ask now since she had already downloaded the key code. There was a completely automatic tea server in place, so she had chosen a room that they could eat and drink in.

“Is black tea okay?”

“No, you needn’t bother with it.”

“Don’t make me lose face as a lady.”

Once she went to the length of saying that, there was nothing he could do but accept the tea.

Despite the fact that it was completely automatic, she did not use the paper cups that were dispensed. She placed tea cups underneath the selection spout and made the effort to make a place setting, complete with matching saucers.

Mayumi seemed to really enjoy the process.

“Here, please have some.”

“Thank you.”

From the moment he took his first polite sip from the cup, he corrected his seating posture.

Almost automatically, Mayumi also straightened her spine as she sat down.

“The subject you wanted to discuss, is it the ‘Parasite’?”

The one who fired the first shot was Mayumi.

Perhaps she had also wanted to discuss the subject with Tatsuya.

“Yes, the information has not been released by the media, but is the damage calming down?”

Not only the media, but the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion’s information routes had also abruptly stopped relaying damage reports.

It was simple if you thought about it; it made it look as if their extermination of the demon had cleared up all the problems. However, they had been able to confirm that the covertly operating demons had a multitude of forms. Not knowing if they had even been able to defeat the “Vampire” despite its lack of substance, for that reason he did not consider the matter completely resolved.

“Officially, things are calming down.”

Mayumi, or more precisely the Saegusa clan, possessed different information routes than Tatsuya. However, even she did not have details about the current situation.

“Although, since the number of missing people is more numerous this year compared to last year, I believe that we may interpret it to mean that they have gotten more skillful in their operations. Our vigilance might have allowed us to bring down one of our prey.”

The conjecture was not Mayumi’s alone; the Saegusa clan also found the facts strange. One week before, only a small portion of the people had been informed that all of the Parasites were said to have been temporarily exterminated.

Thus, the conversation being exchanged here between Tatsuya and Mayumi was truly off the mark in regard to the truth. However, that there was no way that the actual body of the parasite was destroyed and it would be revived in a new host sooner or later was close to the truth. Therefore, the sense of impending danger the two of them harbored was not something pointless.

“There is no way to be sure we brought it down, but perhaps we should be keeping a lookout. Maybe we should equip our allies with telepathy.”

“Tele…pathy?”

The unfamiliar word stalling the flow of the conversation. Mayumi tilted her head, asking for an explanation.

“It is a term for the ability to share inspirations and perceptions. The phenomenon has been observed between identical twins; it is one of the numerous forms of Extrasensory Perception. Even though I said numerous, the examples of it are relatively rare, however.”

“In short, something that can see and hear a portion of its body and allow the whole group to share that experience, is that what you mean?”

“It is nothing but conjecture.”

Mayumi brooded with a glum face.

In order to not interfere with that, he drank his black tea without making a sound,

“…I don’t like all these things we don’t understand,”

but he could hear Mayumi mutter that.

Tatsuya completely shared that emotion, but if he voiced that, it would become a mutual gripe session. He thought that would be too detrimental.

“All we are doing is fumbling around, looking for a method of handling unknown situations.”

Thus, when she spoke of things that they could not do anything about, he withheld any words of comfort.

“…”

Tatsuya also perceived that saying that it didn’t have a physical body increased the discomfort they felt while examining the problem they were giving their complete attention to.

“…If we can’t do that…”

Nevertheless, apparently Mayumi’s attention was centered on a completely different purpose.

“I don’t fully understand what you mean by the ability to share inspirations and perceptions, but hmm… Hey, is there a created sequence for it?”

“…ESP is regarded as being attached to an entirely different field of study than magic research, so I think not.”

The anxiety was heading toward a pinnacle.





How could they end their exchange of information on a good note — Mayumi summed up all she felt with a sigh. At that point, Tatsuya stood up intending to leave without eating anything, but the cuff of his sleeve was firmly grasped by a hand that reached out from the other side of the table. —If Tatsuya had thought to evade it, he would have been able to do so, but he restrained himself since Mayumi didn’t need another poor result.

“Now, why don’t we enjoy our tea time.”

Tatsuya sent a distrustful stare (naturally, intentionally) against the iron wall of Mayumi’s smile, and Mayumi lightly thrust the small box that had been placed on the table with her other hand.

It seemed that she was not going to be kind and forget about that.

So that’s how it’s going to be; Tatsuya let out a small sigh at Mayumi, who was no longer trying to conceal the fact that she was planning something.

No words of rebuke were let loose.

Quite the opposite, Mayumi was looking at Tatsuya with anticipation and excitement in her eyes.

Isn’t she regressing back to childhood due to her anxiety over taking the university entrance exams? While he considered that impossibility (In the first place, Mayumi had no reason to be anxious about her grades), Tatsuya freed the box from the covering.

He did not do it in an overtly, slow, time-consuming way, but he politely peeled it off in a manner that did not damage one bit of the wrapping paper as a token form of resistance.

What came out was a cardboard box covered by a lid. The homemade Valentine’s box had inner walls treated with vinyl; the largeness of the box made it one of the so-called “to convey your true feelings” type.

Of course, he did not mistake it for that.

The atrocious combination of chocolate and coffee that made him light headed would not allow him to have that kind of delusion.

The inside of the box was packed tightly with black, cube shaped objects. They did not resemble anything Tatsuya recognized as “chocolate”.

He had a forewarning of what it would taste like just from the odor.

No matter how much it is said that bitter things do not have to taste bitter, that is limited by quality and quantity.

Tatsuya resignedly put the objects that looked like they should be called medicine instead of food into his mouth and chewed them.

The results of this were — only recorded by Mayumi’s smug smile.




Honoka cut across the school yard toward the preparation room with a large notebook style terminal.

The sun was well on its way down, and the temperature had dropped several degrees. If she let her mind wander, her body will begin to shiver.

However, her mood was not affected by the cold.

Anything that tried to mar her day was brought to heel by her two swinging hair ties.

Her mind unintentionally drifted towards the crystal balls that shook with her.

She acknowledged to herself that she was wearing a stunned expression but she told herself again and again that “It was okay for today only.”

Honoka was well aware that she was not Tatsuya’s girlfriend.

She did not forget that her love confession had been refused.

She had already been rejected.

Even so, for as long as Tatsuya allowed it, she was going to keep clinging to him.

She sometimes felt that she was a “wicked girl” for doing that.

There were also nights that she resented him for not cutting her loose after he rejected her.

However, today she felt like all those negative emotions had been blown away.

Logical thoughts, like this small accessory was too cheap a handout to make her this happy, were powerless in the face of these feelings.

“Honoka!”

As Honoka entered the preparation building with soft footsteps, a voice called out to her from the side and she halted her feet.

“Ah, Eimi.”

The slight girl, who stood out due to her vibrant ruby like hair, rushed up to Honoka with quick feet.

“How unusual for you to come here, Honoka. Isn’t it the first time we’ve seen each other since you’ve become a Student Council officer?”

“I’m standing in for Isori-senpai.”

As she said that, Honoka lifted the notebook style terminal slightly to display it and Eimi gave a look of comprehension.

“What about you, Eimi; are you taking a break from your club?”

The uniform of the hunting club Eimi belonged to was supposed to be a long sleeved shirt under a short jacket, thin trousers and boots, but right now she was in her school uniform. And it was not yet time for club activities to be over.

“There was only a meeting today.”

Since Eimi quickly understood that Honoka had asked the question because of the uniform, she did not inquire “why” she was being asked.

“Hey? Is that crystal?”

She had not meant to ask another question, but the light flickering in Honoka’s hair quickly caught her eye and she asked a question in a tone bursting with curiosity.

“Umm, yes.”

The embarrassed expression might have set a bell ringing; Eimi grinned happily.

“You got that from Shiba-kun, right?”

“…Yes, he said it was a return gift for the chocolate.”

The happiness of the blushing Honoka put a contagiously happy smile on her face, which was shown to the wide-eyed Eimi.

“Ooh… He prepared a present ahead of time, way to go Shiba-kun. He seems so aloof, but he can be that considerate. How mature, eh?”

Honoka’s smile became increasingly happier.

Nonetheless, Eimi’s next words cast a shadow on that smile.

“I understand he’s also quite popular, eh. Just now, it looked like the president was giving him chocolate, maybe that might have been ‘I love you’ chocolate?”

“…President?”

“Ah. I got it wrong. Former president. Saegusa-senpai.”

“Saegusa-senpai was?”

“However, it felt like senpai was detaining him against his will. Since Shiba-kun was making a somewhat troubled face, I don’t think you should be worried.”

Eimi had declared that there was nothing going on and she was probably voicing her real impression. But even though she had been told that, the inside of Honoka’s heart was not calm.

“Doesn’t it seem like Mayumi holds some special feelings for Tatsuya…” that suspicion had been in Honoka’s mind for some time. If she had to compete against Mayumi, Honoka was not confident that she would win.

Her greatest rival right now, Miyuki, was restrained by the fact that they were “truly brother and sister”. Ultimately, there was no way that they could be bound in that fashion, which gave Honoka some peace of mind.

However, Mayumi didn’t have that restriction.

She was superior both in looks and actual magic power; the sole advantage that Honoka possessed was that “the other girl was older than him”. However, Honoka did not think Tatsuya would be bothered by a one to two year age difference.

Waves radiated from within Honoka’s heart.

The waves spread without showing signs of abating.

The waves did not confine themselves to Honoka’s heart.

The thing housed inside the puppet had throbbed for an instant that morning with Honoka’s incredible joy.

Now, through the link that formed at that moment, thought waves flowed causing it to throb again.

The barely born slumbering consciousness had truly awakened this time.




When Tatsuya carried a big cloth bag past the school gate, the sun had already gone down.

Since it was the middle of February, the shortest of days had passed and sunset was falling later.

But they were still receiving a serving of extreme cold.

When the sun’s warmth disappeared, the temperature dropped extremely rapidly.

Naturally, people moved into huddling distance — they couldn’t help it.

Actually, there was almost no distance between the line of figures of students walking home in a hurry who had all remained to be evicted when the school gate was on the brink of closing. —However, there were some exceptions.

On both sides of Tatsuya, in short both Miyuki and Honoka stopped their movements just short of snuggling with him; for some time they had been alternately repeating the action.

On the surface at least, they were probably aware of each other’s existence certainly, but…

“I wonder if perhaps it would be better if I went on ahead.”

Maybe the eyes of the person walking with them were the ones that were most aware of their existence.

“No.”

Lina’s considerate remark was delivered in a monotone; Tatsuya replied with a curt denial.

Tatsuya and Miyuki and Honoka and Lina.

The ones who were currently together were these four.

Tatsuya’s classmates had already been considerate enough to return home ahead of them.

However, Lina was a member of the Student Council, albeit a temporary one.

With both Miyuki and Honoka still working, there was no way Lina could leave early alone. Student government activities were not just like play when compared to her regular army duties; it was play, but that didn’t mean that she could do the work indifferently. Since she had a sense of responsibility as well as an awareness that this was necessary for her infiltration duties, for the time being she was not a “Sirius” and her daily activities did not include being a “chief” or an “executioner”, and it would be a shame to let it go to waste with half measures.

Naturally, today of all days, that unfortunately resulted in her being stuck as the sole observer of Miyuki and the rest as they all went to the station, which put her in her current state of deep regret. —The ambience was so difficult for a third party to endure that Lina forgot that Tatsuya and Miyuki were the targets she was directed to observe and that if it was at all possible, she was to keep her eyes on them all day long.

“Really?”

Tatsuya said he didn’t mind, and the other two silently refused to challenge that. She was on the brink of possibly going on ahead anyway when the station came in sight.

That being said, she still had to hurry down the straightaway; however,

“We’re already this close to the station. So there’s no need to think about going on ahead.”



As has already been explained, modern cabinets do not have a timetable.

But that has nothing to do with up and down.

Tatsuya’s house and Lina’s apartment were in the same upward direction, and Honoka’s was in the downward direction.

By chance on that day, no upward cars remained.

The waiting time posted on the platform was about three minutes.

The three saw Honoka off and waited inside the transparent wall to stave off the cold air for the next car to come around.

Three minutes more or less is a short time. It would not be unnatural even for people in an intimate relationship to not have a conversation.

In contrast, it was completely normal for people who knew each other but were estranged to not have a conversation.

The atmosphere between Lina and the siblings was divided between being hostile and friendly.

Calling a relationship where they had at one time tried to kill each other “friendly” might sound odd if other people heard about it.

Nevertheless, neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki harbored any ill feelings toward her. Especially Tatsuya, who was aware that his feelings were closer to sympathy.

For now, Magicians could not escape from being treated like weapons.

Tatsuya especially could not forget that he was “that type of thing” himself.

If he ever tried to reject that, the nation or society would probably try to eliminate him.

Since his magic held the potential of turning an entire nation into a wasteland.

—And that was true of Lina as well.

—She, like himself, could never run away from being a weapon.

—In a certain sense, Lina had a closer existence to his own than Miyuki’s…

“…Something wrong?”

Perhaps due to his being engrossed in his musings, Tatsuya had been unaware that Lina wanted to say something until Miyuki pulled on his sleeve to get him to pay attention.

“…Not really, it’s nothing.”

Since Miyuki had deliberately let him know, this was not the case of Lina merely looking at him by chance for a few seconds. Lina’s unnatural attitude also said that it was not an “it’s nothing.”

“Really.”

However, Tatsuya did not make any insinuations in order to get her to confess what it was. He was not that much of a busybody, and if he got too close to Lina, Miyuki’s mood would sink as well.

More importantly, the cabinet was about to arrive at the platform.

“Onii-sama.”

And additionally.

“Is there something here?”

“No.”

Turning his head, Tatsuya embraced his sister’s shoulder.

Miyuki trembled in surprise, and leaned her whole body into Tatsuya without hesitation. No more questions came out of her mouth.

For these siblings, this was a simple way of silencing the other.

Tatsuya stowed the knowledge of the gazes upon them in his heart alone.




“What’s wrong?”

Her quick eyes spotting the tension running through her subordinate’s body, Colonel Barans curtly questioned him.

The face of the operator who took his eyes off of the monitor to turn around trembled in confusion.

“Is…is he aware of our surveillance?”

“What kind of stupidity are you saying?”

Barans, the dyed in the wool realist, tossed away her subordinate’s confusion as a mere figment of his imagination.

“It’s a low orbital one but it’s still a surveillance satellite. In the first place. There is no way you could spot the camera from the ground with the naked eye.”

“But just now, I’m certain I saw Tatsuya Shiba’s eyes look straight at me from the monitor.”

In short, their eyes had met while he was watching the camera, but—

“No matter how superior a human’s eyesight is, it is absolutely impossible for them to spot the actual form of a low orbital satellite, right. Much less pick out a camera on the satellite; it cannot be done even by the perception abilities of altered humans whose abilities have been massively transformed.”

As Barans spoke in her irritated voice, the look on his face relaxed a little.

“Alright. Just in case. I’ll take a second look at the images from three minutes ago.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

The real time images were switched to small window display and the recorded images began to be replayed on the main screen. The high resolution camera clearly displayed Major Sirius nervously allowing her gaze to make a round trip to the right, to the left and to the right.

That image was of deep interest to Barans (or rather she could not ignore it), but she concentrated her attention on her subordinate’s problem, Tatsuya Shiba.

The gaze the boy directed toward Major Sirius flickered upward.

Certainly, it seemed like for an instant he had been peering at the camera.

Nonetheless, it was something that could be easily explained away if you thought about it, it was that minor a thing.

What probably actually happened was that he only took a look at the sky on a whim.

The proof was that after that instant he diverted his gaze from the camera.

“It’s just your imagination, like I thought. It’s better than letting your mind wander, but over-vigilance also leads to mistakes in judgment.”

The colonel gave that instruction and turned her eyes away from the main display.

On the sub display, an image of Major Sirius riding inside the small railway car that was called a cabinet in Japan was presented. Of course, Barans was more bothered by the unstable behavior the young girl who bore the title of Sirius was showing.




Lina returned to the rented apartment that was serving as her base of operations in Japan and made a deep sigh in front of the door to her own room.

She was aware that it was too late to do anything with the wrapped box of chocolates lying in her bag.

In the end, no matter how well she had prepared the courtesy chocolate, she had not found a good excuse to broach the subject and returned with it. Reflexively, she had dodged his question with an “it’s nothing,” but the truth was that afterwards, she had decided to pass it to him when they parted.

(…It wasn’t necessary to dodge the question. It’s just courtesy chocolate, after all.)

There was absolutely no deep meaning to the chocolate. In fact “courtesy chocolate” was defined by the world as not having a deep meaning.

—Even so, for her it was a very important resolution. She repeatedly whispered to herself from deep within her heart a number of times that since she had taken the trouble to make it, somehow her stiff face had a smile on it.

Even though they had tried to kill each other once, they had also fought side by side, once.

(Besides, he’s keeping quiet about who I am.)

Since it was only a courtesy, it was not improper. There was no reason to fear creating an improper impression.

She mustered her willpower and took the bundle out of her bag.

(It’s such a waste…)

She hadn’t passed it to him.

Suddenly, she had seen Tatsuya embrace Miyuki’s shoulder and her hand wouldn’t move.

(Why at that time did I…)

She received an extra level of shock from the fact that her hand wouldn’t move from the shock of watching Tatsuya embrace Miyuki’s shoulder.

(What on earth happened to me!)

That the chocolate had gone to waste was unfortunate.

(However, that was inconsequential.)

(More importantly, that was just as if I…)

This was a real problem for Lina.

(Isn’t it like I received a shock due to my liking Tatsuya.)

(That’s not a joke.)

Lina screamed that in her mind. She was deeply disturbed by her own reasoning.

(I refuse to accept this! I absolutely refuse to accept that I might feel that way about a guy who is so sis-con that he’s illicitly in love with that nasty sister of his!)

(…I can accept that I’m aware of him.)

Though she was not aware of who she was talking to, Lina proclaimed that in her heart.

(I am aware of Tatsuya. And not in a normal way, but in an intense way.)

That thought seemed to snarl. Still, she herself didn’t understand who it was snarling at, however.

(But, that’s! That’s because of the humiliation he gave me! Until I wiped out the stain of my defeat, I would not be able to get Tatsuya out of my mind!)

A normal girl might have quipped to herself that if that was so, perhaps she shouldn’t have prepared chocolate, perhaps she should have prepared a white glove.

Nonetheless, at this time Lina did not have that much presence of mind.

When she opened the door in her unstable mood, she became aware of an abnormality.

Her state of mind quickly cooled.

Silvia had returned home, so Lina now lived alone.

Despite that, she felt the presence of a person.

Cold tension ran down her spine.

It was too negligent of her to not be aware of it until she opened the door, so she rebuked herself. While she mentally prepared herself that way, she cautiously slipped inside.

It was far too late for forethought, she thought, but she softly closed the door without making a noise.

She worried about what to do with her shoes for an instant. It was not really a significant consideration, but she did consider how much she was going to have to clean up later.

Once again, she rebuked herself to clear her mind of foolish, idle thoughts; she softly placed her bag on the floor and remained in a crouch in order to rush in.

“—It seems your declaration of perception abilities not being one of your fortés was a modest opinion.”

And when the disgusted voice of the superior officer fell on her from above, she terminated her advance.

“If you had need of me, I would have come to you myself.”

The way Lina finished up preparing the tea (and teacakes) could definitely not tactfully be called smooth as she timidly conversed with Colonel Virginia Barans, who was seated at the side of the simple dining room table.

Nonetheless, the colonel did not make an immediate reply to Lina’s proposal.

“Possibly you might already know this, but the majority of my military service record is comprised of covert behind the scenes operations. And the major part of that career was in the management of personal relations.”

Of course, Lina knew the personal history of a famous person like Colonel Barans. The colonel had graduated from a prestigious business school with superior grades and that record indicated a shrewdness no one would be ashamed to have, and the number of times her work had been on the front lines in her career was not few; she had given a meritorious war service that no one could complain about.

“Now that I have informed you of my experience, Major Sirius.”

“Yes.”

Lina made her spine straight as a pin and answered in a stiff voice. She had instinctively realized halfway through that these were not words to listen to with a smiling face.

“Regarding the current operation, I am concerned that you might possibly be a little too emotionally involved with your target.”

Lina did not reply to Barans’ probe. She had intended to prepare herself for it, but when it came that was completely useless.

“I would never…”

“Really. If I am overthinking it, then it doesn’t have to go any further, but…”

While saying that, Barans turned her eyes to Lina’s bag on the chair.

Lina’s shoulders stiffened.

If she saw what was in that bag, no matter how much she lied, it wouldn’t do any good. She was nearly convinced that her suspicions were true, and that would probably tip the scales. No matter how much she protested that it was a “misunderstanding”, it would probably be impossible to get anyone to believe her…

“I, too, intend to understand your special situation.”

Nevertheless, Barans did not command her to “show her what was in the bag.”

“You are the only one who has been assigned to the post of commander of the STARS corps while still in your teens.”

The simple condemnation was accompanied by a slightly different gaze.

“The potential for magic to usher in a new age for the common people through the use of modern magic techniques allowing magicians to make new discoveries adding to the body of energy theory is high, but quite a few people say you are too young. If my opinion had been asked, I would have probably proclaimed that you were too young for the position of corps commander as well.”

Barans’ voice sounded different than the others who had chanted about the unusualness of Lina’s position.

“You are now sixteen. I understand how it might be hard to control your emotions while being around your fellow sixteen year olds.”

Understanding how her superior’s earnest tone and mood were supposed to work on her, Lina inclined her ears with a meek look.

However, seeing the slightly sincere look on Lina’s face for some reason made Barans sulk a bit.

“…From your point of view, I might be an obaa-san, but I am still in my twenties.”

“Don’t be absurd! I would never think anything like that!”

Lina frantically and vigorously sprang to give a defense against the unwarranted accusation.

Nonetheless, at the same time, Lina felt strangely and surprisingly relieved. The colonel, that impeccable female officer who was seemingly completely without chinks in her armor, was displaying an unthinkable “cute” aspect which had the effect of purifying Lina of her tension.

“…Well, fine. Forget my outburst just now.”

The look that said it was a slip of the tongue on Barans’ face that Lina saw was probably the central part of the performance that was deliberately made to look completely genuine.

“…Certainly, I hold emotions toward Tatsuya Shiba that are undesirable in a soldier of the USNA.”

Since this indeed made it possible for Lina to be more open.

“However, it is absolutely not feelings of love or anything similar to that. The feelings are the type of competitive feelings that a rival invokes.”

“Rival, hm.”

“Yes, I believe the colonel is aware of the written report that I was once defeated by Tatsuya Shiba.”

“I see, this is the first time you have lost a magic battle since you assumed the title of ‘Sirius’.”

“Yes.”

The truth was that she had experienced countless mock battles with Major Canopus since making it into the commanding officer level, but every one of them had multiple safety conditions and it was not necessary to correct the colonel’s declaration.

“Understood. If that’s so, then this is a simple conversation.”

The colonel’s tone subtly changed; the previous mood was mixed with notes of freezing cold.

That was the only thing that informed Lina that the moratorium was over.

“Major Sirius, at the present time, the tracking and disposal of the deserters is temporarily shelved and you are commanded to return to your initial assignment.”

Lina had readjusted her posture before she noticed.

“For now, securing the ‘conversion of mass to energy’ cast sequence user takes precedence. If securing the user is impossible, then it is necessary to render the cast ineffectual.”

To render the cast ineffectual is an euphemism for ensuring that there was no one who could use the sequence. Namely, to assassinate the user.

“For now, we will assume Tatsuya Shiba is the target. The first wave of our attack will be launched tomorrow evening using Stardust. You will equip yourself with Brionac and intervene when you judge the time is right.”

“—Yes Ma’am.”

With a blank expression, Lina stood up and directed a salute to Barans.




Erika was part of the group of First High School students who had long commutes to school. It had been recommended that she get a room close to school when she got accepted by the school. However, she was obstinate about commuting from her own home.

It wasn’t that she could not tolerate being away from her family.

It was the reverse.

When her father arranged the condo (he did not say he was “renting it for Erika,” he said he was “buying it to give to Erika”), she became stubborn about “commuting from home.”

Compared to the displeasure of doing as told by her father or eldest brother, the somewhat inconvenience was no big deal.

The road from the station to her home was pretty dark on the way back, and Erika walked instead of using a commuter. It was not something that was recommended for a pretty girl like her to do, but her family had absolutely no worries. Because perverts and the small time hoodlums called purse snatchers did not have people among them who possessed the skills to be able to harm Erika.

This was not a personal biased view, but the objective truth. Today, Erika once again survived traveling to the entrance to her home without anything happening.

Her room was not in the main house. Her “home” was an annex beside the Dojo.

No one aside from her lived in the annex; the minute she entered her room, Erika flung her bag away and collapsed on her bed, still in her uniform. She wasn’t usually this sloppy. She was just exhausted from the annual established customary event, her emotions running wild after all of the inquiring gazes she had received throughout the day.

She was aware of her own good looks (objectively she rated herself a little modestly), so she knew nothing could be done about the attention she received from boys around her age (and some girls) on a day like today, but…

(In that case, they should know I’m not the courtesy chocolate type.)

“From the start, they can only see my outer appearance” was the conclusion she made, which left her feeling even more exhausted.

She didn’t hate the way she looked.

It was better to be beautiful than ugly.

But she thought the disadvantages equaled the advantages.

Erika believed it was better to have her level of prettiness than face the numerous hardships of being an overly beautiful girl like Miyuki.

But she hated being judged by appearance alone.

And of course she abhorred being fussed over for her looks.

An over-reliance on goodwill that comes from being good looking was only the foundation for the ill fortune of liking only the part of yourself that others like.

Erika was sure of that.

Her eyes spontaneously went to a spot above the dresser.

Which was adorned by a small photograph in a frame.

It was not a digital photo, but a photographic print of a woman with hair a little brighter chestnut than Erika’s own and whose features greatly resembled Erika. The resemblance was such that after ten years you would think that Erika would look identical.

It was a picture of Erika’s mother, who had passed on when Erika was fourteen years old.

The woman who gave birth to Erika was also the woman who created the reason she lived all alone in this annex.

Anna Rozen Katori.

That was the name of Erika’s mother.

As the name suggested, she was half German.

And her family name was not Chiba.

For her father, the head of the Chiba family and one of the Hundred Families, Erika’s mother had been his “lover” if you used the current euphemism; if you used an blunt, old style word, she had been his “concubine”.

Erika had not been allowed to use the family name of “Chiba” until after her mother had died; moreover, it was not until just before she entered high school — actually, she didn’t receive the name of “Chiba Erika” until she took the high school entrance exam — that her relatives permitted it. (As a result, Tatsuya had not known of the existence of “Chiba Erika”)

Erika had been born before his legal wife had died from an illness. They did “that kind of thing” while the wife was lying on her sickbed, as such, Erika thought that there were no excuses for what her parents did. It seemed cold, but on that note, she placed part of the blame on her mother.

Even so, she absolutely did not accept that her mother should be regarded as the only wrongdoer. After all, most of the responsibility belonged to her father.

There had been a time when she had lived her days not knowing the reason for the contemptuous eyes, her small body hiding even shorter breath.

There had also been a period when she just wildly swung her sword around in order for her mother and herself to be acknowledged. —That had been when she became the idol of Chiba Dojo. Among the young Dojo trainees in their teens and twenties, skilled students had gathered and formed 「Erika’s personal entourage」 because they could see that Erika had lost her enthusiasm for swordplay after she lost her mother, and stuck their noses into a lot of her personal affairs.

Looking back at the past, she believed that now was the richest, most enjoyable time in her life up to this point.

Female friends who meekly accepted that “they were no match for her” and male friends who could not see her core no matter how much they looked at her.

Classmates who warmed her heart,

Friends whom she could squabble with and tease,

A childhood friend whom she could also tease.

A group of friends who acknowledged her “power” and the chance to brandish that power.

Now, waving a sword was fun. The time she squandered in flourishing her sword was by no means wasted.

If she was with them, she felt like she could climb to the paramount.

Therefore — she didn’t want to be bothered by trivial love games.

She idly gazed at the ceiling while she mused about these things; unexpectedly, the door chime rang. Not the signal to answer, but the signal of the door being opened. Since she hadn’t turned the key, the person had probably entered freely.

There was no way she was going to peek in the room to see who it was — she didn’t intend to act like she was nervous.

She checked the time.

It was too early to sit down for dinner.

Her two elder brothers (naturally, neither shared a mother with her) and her elder sister (of course, she didn’t share a mother with her either) to be blunt hated sitting with her; on Erika’s side, time slipped away. Since it was evident that whenever they met, not only her elder sister but she too felt uncomfortable, there was no need to persevere in obstinacy.

Just as she was about to rouse her body to see who it could be, there was a knock on her door.

By the way the footsteps sounded coming toward her, the even breathing, and the controlled presence, who it could be was narrowed down to her two brothers. Since her eldest brother was devoting all his time to a certain case and was supposed to be returning home late every night—

“Tsugu-aniue? Please come in.”

As she said that, she migrated from above the bed to in front of the desk.

“Sorry for interrupting your rest, Erika.”

Erika sat in front of the desk with the chair rotated toward the door, with her spine straight and both hands placed on her knees, but her next eldest brother, Naotsugu, took in the condition of the bed in a fleeting glance and voiced an apology.

Well, this level of observation power from an elder brother given the title of the “Chiba Kirin” wasn’t surprising.

Actually, Erika didn’t even twitch an eyelid.

“No, I was just resting my body a little. Well then, you needed something?”

Seeing him with that female during summer vacation had unfortunately sent her into a frenzy, but other than times like that, being by the side of this brother was for Erika the place her heart felt most at ease.

She would only raise her voice to this brother when he was entangled with that female.

“Hmm… I’m puzzled about whether I should tell you or not, but… after all, I think I will tell you. Erika, I believe you have a male classmate named Shiba Tatsuya?”

“Yes, what about him?”

It didn’t show in her face, but at this moment, Erika was pretty disturbed. Her next eldest brother suddenly asking about Tatsuya was completely unexpected.

“He is under surveillance by the National Defense Force.”

“…Uh?”

“It’s not surprising that you have difficulty believing it without any warning, but it’s the truth.”

Certainly, she had trouble believing this surprising information, but she probably found it hard to believe for a different reason than Naotsugu thought.

Erika knew that Tatsuya is what is known as a civilian member of the National Defense Force.

At that time, an officer had taken him away and told them that the fact Tatsuya is attached to the National Defense Force is a highly classified national secret.

So it was likely that the lower ranks of military personnel would not be aware of his status.

But still, Erika felt it was so ridiculous that she didn’t even want to laugh, that a member of the National Defense Force would be used to conduct surveillance on Tatsuya, who was a member of the same organization, albeit an atypical one.

Naturally, dumbfounded as it made her, that had no connection to the duties given and so,

“I have also received an informal order.”

It seemed that using a member of the same organization was not pure stupidity.

“Does the mission really need you, Tsugu-aniue, with your formal status as a student at the military college? What on earth could you…”

“Watching him and, if necessary, protect him.”

“Watch and… protect?”

“Ah. Apparently Shiba-kun has got himself involved in some kind of trouble that the military has an interest in.”

Erika thought that rather than being involved, he was the matter the military had been concerned with for some time now, but she thought she’d better not say anything for Tatsuya’s sake and for Naotsugu’s sake as well, so she was silent.

“Erika, I think it’s better if you stay away from Tatsuya for a while.”

“Do you mean even inside the school? He and I are in the same class.”

She wasn’t going to automatically listen and obey no matter how much she respected her next eldest brother, but — make no mistake, if her eldest brother had said that she’d be laughing her head off — for now she was going to try to investigate this extremely fishy matter.

“No, I believe that he won’t be attacked at school.”



From those words, she understood the true motive of the party that gave Naotsugu the order — rather than being a target, Tatsuya was acting as bait.

In short, the main attackers were a different lot than Lina; even if Lina was a part of it, the possibility of a different group was high… Erika decided.

“In that case Aniue, there’s no need for concern. Since Shiba-kun and I are friends that go to and from the station together, we aren’t close enough to make plans for after school or go to each others’ homes.”

“That’s true. Really you should avoid commuting to school with him… Since it wouldn’t be good if you stir up uneasiness.

Anyway, be careful, Erika.”

“Thank you, Aniue.”

—As she had been told to when she was with Tatsuya, she’d be careful, Erika added on in her heart.




Immediately after they got home, Miyuki took the paper bag full of chocolates from her brother’s hand and stowed it in the refrigerator.

Up until last year, even when he received no more than one or two, he had been concerned about his younger sister’s response; however, this year, to Tatsuya’s great relief, Miyuki’s resentment had been cooler than he thought it would be.

“Onii-sama, I will soon start preparing dinner, so will you please stay in your room for the time being?”

Miyuki abruptly turned to Tatsuya, who had followed her into the kitchen in order to see how she was, and, with an unnaturally wide smile, thrust that barb.

If he translated it, she meant “don’t come out and look until I call you.” Remembering with a touch of unease how bizarrely things had played out last year, Tatsuya meekly shut himself up in his room.

And in about one hour,

“I’ve come…”

Without thinking, Tatsuya murmured that aloud.

The dining room was filled with a sweet fragrance, the genuine article completely different from Mayumi’s fake concoction; there could be no mistake, this was the smell of chocolate.

With a smile — this time it was a natural smile — Miyuki invited him to take a seat.

Her appearance stunned Tatsuya into silence.

“How may I help you, sir?”

Her smile transforming into a wickedly mischievous one, Miyuki tilted her head slightly as she asked him.

Clearly, the face of someone who was aware of what she was doing.

“…I don’t know where you could have gotten that costume.”

“Costume? These are simple clothes used by waitresses.”

Now that she mentioned it, the clothes certainly might be suitable for use by the hospitality industry.

However, not only did Time and Occasion have to be considered, but Place, and he did not think it suitable here.

If this was not a dining room in a private home, but rather a restaurant that served clientele with certain inclinations, then it could be said to fit the Time, Place and Occasion.

Miyuki’s waitress uniform had puffy sleeves, a high laced jumper skirt, and an apron full of ruffles. In short, it was Julie Andrews style[6].

Even though he could understand how the concept suited the food, hadn’t she gone a little too far…

“Umm, could it be that I don’t look good in these clothes…?”

“No, it looks good on you. Very cute.”

When his sister asked him that question in an unsure tone of voice, no matter what Tatsuya thought, he wasn’t going to say anything that would hurt her and cause him to look for something to hit his head against.

“Thank you!”

In contrast to what was going on in the depths of Tatsuya’s heart, Miyuki’s spirit had revived and she brought out her dishes one by one. Leaving Tatsuya with no reason not to go to the dining room table.

On to the all important menu for today.

The main meat course was a beef filet in chocolate sauce.

It was accompanied by cookies full of nuts and a chocolate fondue.

The dessert was fruits with a brandy-infused white chocolate fondue.

Without exaggeration, it was overloaded with chocolate.

“Onii-sama, please enjoy this feast. I, Miyuki, have prepared this Valentine Chocolate especially for Onii-sama.”

Certainly, this was not something that could be done if you didn’t live together.

This presentation of cooked chocolate as something other than a sweet.

All things considered, it would certainly go into Tatsuya’s mouth today.

Everything here was the result of Miyuki stretching her resourcefulness.

Around the time he finished the dessert, Miyuki’s face was tinged with a lot of red. While he was eating the white chocolate fondue, he had been worried that Miyuki didn’t cook out enough of the brandy’s alcohol, and apparently it wasn’t just a figment of his imagination.

Because Miyuki hadn’t eaten as much as he did, she had absorbed a higher quantity of alcohol than him, but…

“Miyuki, are you okay?”

“Yes? What is it?”

As Miyuki answered with a puzzled look on her face, she got up to clear the table.

The pronunciation of her answer was slightly off.

Miyuki piled all the plates on top of each other in order to take them away in one go.

Tatsuya felt this was dangerous.

The normal Miyuki would have taken two to three trips to carry this many dishes.

She was probably not thinking about the difficulty and had unmistakably made the choice out of an unconscious desire to get it done quickly.

Tatsuya swiftly and silently went around the table.

“Eek!?”

As feared, he had to embrace his sister’s body to keep her from falling when she tripped over her own feet.

There was no crash of dishes hitting the floor.

While one arm supported Miyuki, the hand on the other arm was catching the rest of the plates.

Smoothly, he twisted his body and returned the dishes to the table.

Afterwards, he once again supported his sister’s body with both hands and straightened.

“Th…thank you, Onii-sama.”

“Miyuki, rest on the sofa for awhile.”

Miyuki did not protest that she was alright.

The only result of protesting would be causing unnecessary trouble for Tatsuya and that would be awful.

He piled the dishes in the sink and left the rest for the HAR to take care of for her. Even though she knew it wasn’t a lot of work, she felt guilty for letting her brother handle the clean up alone and tried to rid herself of at least some guilt.

However, she could not avoid becoming depressed.

Despite the nice atmosphere she had created, at the very end she had clumsily stamped it out… Was the lie she told to herself.

She could not help feeling that something beyond human understanding might be disgusted with her.

No, from the start it should be called disgust. It should be called an obstacle. It should be called a curse.

“…Why must I be Onii-sama’s younger sister?”

With a large sigh, the words unintentionally sprang from her mouth.

A piece of her real wishes had gushed forth.

A shard that reflected her heart.

A phrase that had been repeating over and over in her heart since yesterday.

Panicked, Miyuki turned around.

The statement she made just now must never be heard by her elder brother.

A thought that must never be uttered.



She was not unhappy to be his younger sister.

These were Miyuki’s true feelings, not a falsehood.

After all, the reason Miyuki could be with Tatsuya was because she was his sister.

Indeed, it was because she was his sister that her brother was constantly concerned about her.

However — without a doubt — there was also a self that desired a different relationship within Miyuki’s heart.

For now, there weren’t too many pieces.

Nevertheless, someday, that self might overwhelm the self that thought it was good to be his little sister.

Miyuki feared that day.

She feared her brother finding out about the part of her that wished for that.

When she had looked behind her, Tatsuya was still in front of the sink.

Even with the five sharp senses he possessed, the distance was too far for him to catch a soft whisper.

Miyuki was relieved.

In a corner of her heart, there was regret that he had not heard her.

She averted her eyes from that part of her.





Chapter 11




It was in darkness.

Despite its consciousness being awakened, it could not move the physical body.

The eyes wouldn’t open.

The ears wouldn’t hear.

The sense of smell and the sense of touch also wouldn’t work.

If it were human, it would have probably gone mad in half a day. Nevertheless, it was not human. In the usual meaning of the words, it was not a living thing.

It could wait forever. After all, it did not possess the concept of what is called a life span. Since its consciousness had awakened, it had housed itself in something and itself was continuing to ponder something. In order to fumble for that, itself would have to learn about the vessel itself was housed in.

It soon realized what itself was. What had given it consciousness in this empty vessel it was inserted into, it did not ponder in the least. Because it was indeed an empty vessel, it was not distracted by thoughts that would become mere static.

It understood the purpose for which it was born. All that was left was to acquire the power of movement.

Patiently, it continued to wait when suddenly, it felt energy flowing into the vessel.

Quickly, it seized the body. The knowledge of how to do so was stored in the brain. Unlike last time, it took liberties, but happily, it did not remember that time. Within the brain, bustling electronic signals were changed into Psion signals; reading someone’s mind was something it had experience with from last time. Even if it did not remember doing it, it understood how to do it and luckily, this vessel had accumulated a large quantity of Psions.

It read itself by immersing the interior in Psion signals it, itself, emitted. It learned the way to use this body. The eyes were able to see. The ears were able to hear. The fingers, arms, and legs moved. With this, it was now able to be used by that person. It did not want to intentionally show the joy from acquiring a body that moved.

—Nevertheless, the expression did not change. This body did not have a mechanism for changing expressions installed. Therefore, it had, with its own power, made the happy expression while it searched for that person with the brain it had acquired.




Fifteenth February.

Instead of the unpredictable atmosphere of yesterday, a mysterious confusion floated over the campus of First High.

It had nothing to do with any of the students. Quite the contrary, the majority of the students had no direct contact with the incident.

Despite that, in a twinkling of an eye, a wave of curiosity about the mystery spread throughout the whole school.

Tatsuya stepped on to the scene of the incident during the noon break before lunch.

There was no way that this was a display of his curiosity. A first year whose face was familiar — an actual “person involved in the incident” — had begged him until he reluctantly agreed to come.

“Ah, Shiba-kun.”

When he recognized Tatsuya, Isori called out to him from somewhere in a relieved voice.

“Isori-senpai, thank you for calling me. Has Nakajou-senpai also been dragged into this?”

Needless to say, Tatsuya calling Azusa “Nakajou-senpai” instead of “President” wasn’t because he still thought of Mayumi as president or any other secret meaning. As usual, Kanon was beside Isori. Among the crowd of people, Tatsuya focused on Hattori, the Group Management Leader, who was also there.

“A large number of students felt uneasy about the phenomenon…”

Azusa, herself, uneasily answered. Although she had been called in, this problem did not seem like one that was in her wheelhouse.

“However, to be truthful, I think the incident is beyond the skill of a high school student. Have we heard anything from the teachers?”

“To be truthful,” the fellow first year who had brought Tatsuya here, was in the vicinity and seemed to be thinning his lips in dissatisfaction because he felt that that did not apply to Tatsuya.

The 3H, [Humanoid Home Helper: a human shaped housekeeping aid robot] — a mechanism in human form — was smiling; it was said to have been hit with magic power.

If all the humanoid had done was smile, it probably wouldn’t have accumulated this much concern. There was already a humanoid-type robot prototype equipped with an expression changing function. For a Type P94 that did not have an expression changing function installed to actually change expression was indeed an abnormal situation, but that would not bother people unfamiliar with technology all that much without a doubt. And in a Magic High School, there is a pronounced tendency to be unfamiliar with non-magic arts like purely mechanical arts.

However, if a puppet that wasn’t supposed to be able to change expressions had been made to smile through the use of magic, then it was a paranormal incident that magic high school students could not ignore.

Even if they who used magic dealt with the “Arcane,” they did not deal with the “Paranormal.” In fact, they probably felt even more fear and unease from abnormal incidents because they were people who manipulated the supernatural.

“Until a little while ago, Tsuzura-sensei was investigating, but he stated that he could not draw a clear conclusion.”

“He could not eliminate anything either?”

“That’s right.”

As he answered, Isori appeared to become a degree more bewildered.

“He was able to observe traces of a high Psion concentration from the body of the P94. Sensei said it seemed like they were being released from within the inner workings of the chest, outward.”

As Isori replied, Tatsuya scowled, which might be only natural.

“The chest portion of a 3H is the containment unit for the electronic brain and the fuel cell? From which is it coming from?”

In the framework of the 3H, the communication unit and main sensor were in the head part, a single fuel cell was installed in the chest, taking up both the left and right parts with the electronic brain jammed into it, and information cables and energy cables passed within the skeletal frame.

If he said the origin of the emissions was the center of the chest, then it was probably the electronic brain, but…

“He said the vicinity of the electronic brain. Geez… the workmanship is too good.”

The reply was predictable. Tatsuya didn’t want to sigh with Isori.

It was normal, but there was no mechanism for emitting Psions in the electronic brain. It was necessary to have an induction stone transforming both electronic signals and Psion signals to get them to interact and there was nothing like an induction stone installed in the computer of a 3H — it wasn’t needed. And truthfully, it was not something that was supposed to have been… installed.

“…Have the members of this club remodeled it?”

By this club, he meant the Robot Research Club. The place they were talking in was the garage assigned to them as a clubroom.

“If they had, they wouldn’t be this worried.”

The reply to Tatsuya’s not really serious question was mixed with a dry laugh.

The slight jibe was not very useful in lightening the mood.

“Also, he seems to have been able to see traces of Pushions. But with them, he couldn’t tell if the emissions originated from the inside or outside.”

“Because compared to the Psion sensor, the performance of the Pushion-observing machinery is crude.”

Isori’s voice hung lightly in the air, but the supplemental information he gave strongly stimulated Tatsuya’s mental processes.

Within his head, he was composing an astonishing hypothesis. He forcibly restrained his wild imagination and pressed the hypothesis causing those ideas to the back of his mind temporarily.

“Aren’t you able to see anything strange in the CONTROL? Has it started moving on its own…”

“Oh, not up til now. Even now, it’s obeying orders, waiting in suspension mode for the next command.”

There were indications of people talking behind them. The way things were going he would probably miss lunch; well, Miyuki or Honoka might buy him lunch, Tatsuya worried.

“Then, what do you want me to do?”

Nevertheless, his conversation with Isori wasn’t over yet. Why was he called in, and was it absolutely certain that he couldn’t quietly order something to eat.

“I want you to check the P94’s electronic brain. A CAD is an example of a mechanism that combines electronic arts and magic arts. And at our school, the most talented person who knows the most about CAD software is you. At least, that’s what I think. Since the Nine Schools Competition.”

After Isori said all that to him, possibly due to suddenly becoming aware of the stares from the gallery, he lowered his voice.

“I want you to make sure that there isn’t something like the ‘Golden Electron Silkworms’ trick at the Nine Schools Competition.”

“I see.”

Even Tatsuya gradually got a grip on what Isori might be concerned about.

Certainly, if it were a delayed activation concealed type, then even if the expression changed, they still might not be able to detect someone using magic on the puppet. They didn’t know why anyone would do that, but the possibility of criminal mischief was not zero.

“I understand. However, I cannot do a thorough check here, but could if I used a maintenance room.”

“That will be fine. I’ll get permission soon.”

Azusa was the one who gave this answer. She was quite adept at using a phone style terminal, and she lifted up her face with a sigh of relief.

“I have permission to use a maintenance room. We can use it when fourth period is over.”

Is that an implicit reminder not to cut class? Tatsuya commented in his head.



The room where the CAD modification machines were installed was called the fitting room. This room was normally used by students and staff to modify their CADs.

The maintenance room wasn’t just for modifying CADs to fit the user, but also for tuning and arranging CADs; it also had devices for detailed configuration alterations and other mechanisms that made remodeling easier. However, they were expensive specialized machines and difficult to apply properly. For those reasons, Tatsuya brought the actual body of the P94 to the maintenance room that rarely had users.

Tatsuya’s companions were Isori and Azusa, with the addition of Miyuki, Honoka, Erika, Leo, Mikihiko and Mizuki, his usual cohorts. Once his patient was stowed away, everyone else quickly fled, probably due to the overwhelming creepiness of that face.



Kanon, as Mizuki and the others learned, had gone on a procurement errand. The extra onlookers were shut out by Hattori. Hattori was not included among the extra onlookers, and that he acknowledged the rights of Erika and Leo to be seated with him gave a glimpse of his complicated personality. Of course, this was probably not due to any weakness of his. He looked somewhat relieved that they weren’t gazing at Isori and Azusa like curious tourists.

“To start with, can’t you tell me everything that happened.”

While munching on the hot sandwich that Isori had kindly agreed that he could have when he suggested that they eat first, Tatsuya requested accurate information.

“I know no more than the rumors floating around campus.”

The fellow first year that had dragged Tatsuya into the mess hadn’t explained enough about the situation.

“The beginning of the incident was around seven o’clock this morning?”

In response to Tatsuya’s demand, Isori nodded “of course” and, in a business like tone, began to explain.



——February 15th 7:00am

The 3H type P94 nicknamed “Pixie,” which was stored in the robot research garage, was reactivated from suspended mode by a wireless device. The Humanoid Home Helper commonly called a 3H housekeeping aid robot also has a timer to restart it using its own power, but due to the burden on the fuel cells, it is recommended that an outside source of electricity be used.

When students are not in attendance, Pixie awakens and performs its self diagnostic program. The 3H user manual states that it is desirable for the diagnostic program to be run every morning before doing household chores. It is not a procedure followed very much in regular households, but the Robot Research Club follows the manual faithfully since they do not own the P94.

As stated before, there were no students in the garage. And there was no unusual activity observed from the cameras inside or outside the garage when the server used the remote application that had been installed in it to start the self diagnostic, no matter how much it’s been examined.

The self diagnostic program concluded that there was nothing unusual in the startup process. When the program completed, the 3H was supposed to return to suspension mode.

As a matter of fact, the 3H which supposedly had nothing wrong with it did not perform its planned cease of function.

After the self diagnostic program stopped, the P94 began electronically communicating with the server. According to the access log, the data it received was the student register of this school.

Deciding that there was a high possibility that it was infected with remotely activated malware, a cease function command was sent. Since the cease function command applied to more than the electronic brain, the command superseded all other commands. Naturally, if an implanted program (as machines were not allowed to run amok) was used in the OS, resistance would be futile software wise.

Machines used by the military had a device inserted in them to shut out long distance remote commands, but machines for civilian use did not have that device installed. Of course, P94 was also unequipped with that kind of hardware. This allowed the shut down sequence to be processed safely; even though it took some time for it to completely shut down, there was no way the actual command could be ignored.

In spite of that, Pixie did not completely cease functioning.

Afterwards it continued requesting data from the server; on the server’s side, it closed the wireless connection, and finally P94 stopped its abnormal movements.

Throughout this abnormal operating period, the observation cameras recorded Pixie smiling a seemingly happy smile—

“That expression is like it’s excitedly waiting for something.”

After Isori summed up everything, Azusa’s face seemed a little paler, for her creepy expression probably incited fear. When a mechanical doll that was not supposed to change expressions made a face like that, even Tatsuya unmistakably got the creeps.

“I looked at the P94’s logs and the mandatory command was certainly received. No, if it is to be trusted then without a doubt, the cease function command was executed on the P94’s electronic brain.”

As he listened to the words, Tatsuya appeared to ponder a little.

“…The P94 continued to operate when the electronics were supposed to be shut down because something other than electricity was sending command signals to control the machine. And I think that something was either a Psion wave, or some kind of magic power that was accompanied by a Psion wave.”

“Just what I expected from you Shiba-kun, that’s correct. Tsuzura-sensei stated the same thing, but I can’t think of another explanation either.”

“Understood… I will examine it.”

As they talked, he felt that the machine being infected with a new type of virus seemed quite likely, but that explanation did not tie in the “smile.” He hesitated to use his “observation power” in front of Isori and Azusa, but apparently nothing was going to happen if he didn’t monitor it.

“Pixie, suspension mode release.”

Tatsuya spoke to the girl type robot seated on the self-propelled cart (to be correct, it was seated on the chair installed on the cart).

Results immediately appeared. To be brief, the normal response to the vocal input. The machine nicknamed Pixie quickly opened its eyes, stood up from the chair and bowed deeply.

“Do you have an order, sir.”

The preset words for being activated smoothly flowed out of the slightly moving lips.

The unnecessary prepared phrase once again smoothly flowed in its fixed format; however, the tone felt like it was closer to human than before.

“Browse the operations and communications logs from after seven o’clock this morning. Rest on the stand, face up, and switch to inspection mode.”

“Confirm administrator authority.”

Tatsuya’s command needed a supervisor authorization; Pixie’s reply to this was also a preset format response.

Because she had not gotten down from the cart, her eyes were a little higher than Tatsuya’s and the girl was looking into Tatsuya’s eyes. —Of course, that is how it would be described if it was a human behaving like this; actually, she was looking at his whole face. At this distance, scanning for an iris recognition system was still theoretical.

By the way, Tatsuya was not registered as a supervisor for Pixie. Consequently, a face pass (short for facial recognition security) was useless; that was not a way to give proof of authorization.

Actually, Tatsuya had an administrative authority card in his pocket.

Therefore, from the beginning, Pixie’s eyes should not have been looking at his face, but at his pocket.

Despite that.

Pixie’s gaze.

Stayed on Tatsuya’s face like it was glued to it and did not move from it.

The time lost staring at him made fixated a better word to describe that gaze.

Just as not only Tatsuya and Azusa but everyone began to feel that “something is weird,” Pixie moved.

A small whisper of “Found” spun out from its mouth,

And in a deliberate manner, ascended from the cart,

And in the next instant flung itself at Tatsuya.

(Avoidance inadvisable!)

Within Tatsuya’s own mind,

(Threat rating small.)

These compressed ideas flitted.



—Tatsuya caught Pixie’s body, which was a head shorter than his own, from the front.

On the assumption that 3Hs would be used in civilian homes, they were constructed from light weight materials.

The impact was not all that large. Surely, it was probably on the level of being embraced by a normal adult woman.

An indistinct shriek sounded.

Both of Pixie’s arms were firmly circling Tatsuya’s neck.

In short, it could be honestly said, there was no doubt he was being embraced.

No one, Tatsuya himself included, could utter a word.

Being at a loss for words was a phrase probably made to be used for occasions like this.

Surprise of that extent ruled inside the room.

Robots could not make this passionate display of emotion—

“…Oh, Shiba-kun is even popular with robots.”

The silence within the room was broken by a person who had not felt that moment of shock.

Kanon had just now entered the room and delivered that unamused one-liner.

This served as an impetus for them to, one by one, begin to revive from their emotional stupor.

Tatsuya felt a penetrating stare on his back.

Right behind him, a cold blizzard of rage was being sent at him.

Miyuki had promptly revived back to her normal state after being frozen in shock.

Although whether this should be called a normal state was not completely without question.

“…I do not know of any interest in playing with dolls within Onii-sama.”

“Anyway, for now, calm down, Miyuki.”

If all Miyuki did was send a rebuking look in Honoka’s direction, well, anyway, Tatsuya did not think of any false accusations of infidelity from his younger sister. —That he could make such assumptions with such things happening on a regular basis left no doubt that there was something wrong on the “elder brother”s’ side.

“There is no way I’m embracing it. I’m the one being embraced.”

“With Onii-sama’s physical abilities, you would have no difficulty in evading it.”

Certainly, if he had thought to evade it, he would have evaded it. The 3H’s maximum mechanical strength was below what could accidentally damage household tools and utensils and it was also not strong enough to hurt their owners’ family, so 3Hs were restrained to have less strength than the average adult woman.

“If I had evaded, I would have collided with you.”

That is why he hadn’t evaded Pixie, because Miyuki was right behind him. There was not all that much difference between their weights even if he leapt backward; it would be enough to stop him, but the possibility of him knocking Miyuki down was high.

“Oh, you could figure out all that in that instant.”

“You can tell that much merely from looking.”

Leo’s voice showed surprise and Erika used a “you just figured it out” tone for her one liner.

“…I am sorry. I was so rude…”

On the other hand, Miyuki, who hadn’t understood (or rather had not been able to think clearly enough to reach that conclusion) after pressing both hands to her mouth, despondently and feebly poured out an apology. However, despite being visibly depressed, she was also somewhat happy.

“More importantly, we should do something about Pixie.”

As a result of Azusa finally being able to move again, she made this suggestion in a diffident voice.

Tatsuya, who had been overlooking the fact that he was still being embraced, made a slightly evil looking smile.

“Pixie, release me.”

At Tatsuya’s command, the flexible resin coated mechanical arms of Pixie twitched. —This was a bit much for a simple movement created by a motor.

Pixie obediently removed its arms. —There was visible reluctance that was not a simple optical illusion.

The gaze with heat pouring out of both eyes looking up at Tatsuya was also not a figment of his imagination.

This should all be nothing more than an optical illusion, but — for some reason, Tatsuya could not ignore it.

“The change of mode command is revoked. Pixie, sit on the couch.”

“As you wish.”

This time it readily obeyed the order. The common sense interpretation was that it was because it was not a command that needed administrative privileges, however, due to the unnatural movements earlier that happened before their eyes, it appeared as if it was only meekly obeying because it was Tatsuya’s order.

“Mizuki.”

Next, Tatsuya called out Mizuki’s name.

“Y-Yes?”

Mizuki had been deep in bystander mode; being suddenly named affected her speech.

Mizuki, herself, was not the only one who felt surprised; Isori and Kanon turned suspicious eyes on her.

“Mizuki, please peek inside Pixie for me. Mikihiko, I want you to guard Mizuki so she doesn’t suffer any great damage from this.”

“…You think something is occupying Pixie?”

Unconsciously, Mikihiko whispered the question.

“Something, hmm, you chose to put it in a roundabout way, Mikihiko.”

Tatsuya’s reply was also not straightforward, but they more or less expected what he had to say, so it was enough.

Instead of a CAD, which he was banned from possessing (on campus), Mikihiko produced charms and went on alert.

It seemed that Mizuki also discerned the path of Tatsuya’s thoughts. She tensed, a slightly scared look was on her face, but even so she took off her glasses and steadily examined Pixie.

Mizuki’s eyes widened.

Faster than she could open her mouth, a change came over Pixie.

There was an expression on the humanlike mask.

From what could be seen, it was establishing its existence — this could also be part of the phenomenon.

“It’s there… the Parasite is there.”

Someone gulped.

With the exception of Mizuki, everyone there was showing their surprise in individual ways, and each one of them stood ready for action in their own manner.

“But…”

Mizuki’s whisper was not yet finished.

“This pattern…”

After Mizuki scowled and made an anxious “Hmmmmm,” she quickly turned around.

“Eh, what?”

The focus of her gaze was Honoka.

After closely examining Honoka for a looong time, Mizuki’s stare made numerous round trips between Honoka and Pixie.

“This pattern… resembles Honoka-san’s.”

And when Mizuki spun out her conclusion,

“Eeh!?”

Honoka raised her voice in horror.

“…What do you mean?”

Kanon was the one who voiced the blunt question, but she was not the only one thinking it.

“The Parasite is under the influence of Honoka-san’s thought waves.”

Confronted with natural surprise and natural doubt, Mizuki answered in a rare unambiguous tone of voice.

“Umm, you mean that it is under Mitsui-san’s control?”

“No, I don’t think there’s that kind of link.”

Mizuki shook her head at Isori’s query.

“There’s no link connecting Honoka-san and the parasite; I feel that the Parasite is taking and duplicating Honoka-san’s thoughts. Perhaps, Honoka-san’s ‘thought’ being baked into the Parasite is the proper way to put it.”

“I am not doing that!”

“She is not saying that you are doing it deliberately, Honoka.”

Tatsuya comforted the panicking Honoka.

“Is that right, Mizuki?”

“Ah, yes. It’s not a conscious thing, I think it’s closer to receiving the impression of past thoughts.”

The outbreak of panic was averted.

However, the matter of doubt had not completely evaporated.

“Impressions of past thoughts… In short, things Mitsui-san thinks strongly about are being taken and copied by a Parasite casually floating nearby? And afterward, it possessed Pixie? Or was a Parasite inserted into Pixie and Mitsui-san’s thoughts got cooked into…?”

Mikihiko’s remarks were meant to collect his own thoughts; in essence, it was a monologue.

However, a moment after his remarks, Honoka suddenly hung her head in shame.

Concealing her face with both hands.

From what little that could be seen, her face was much redder than usual.

Apparently, she had some idea of how it happened.

Before anyone could cross-examine her,

[That’s correct.]

The person, herself — no, in this case, “itself” should be used — gave out the answer.

[I have been awakened by the strong, distinctive thoughts she has about him.]

Pixie’s lips made a movement that a human could follow when the words poured out.

However, those “words” reverberated not in their ears but in their minds.

“A working form of telepathy?”

“It seems that the Psions were a psychic residue, not a magic residue.”

Tatsuya answered Azusa’s murmur in that fashion and proceeded to stand in front of Pixie.

“Is voice communication possible?”

[Understanding voice is possible. However, manipulating this body’s vocal organs is difficult; please use this intentional transmission called telepathy.]

“Because they’re not vocal organs; it is a mechanism. That being said, it seems that you comprehend our words quite well; how did you learn to do this?”

[The knowledge was inherited from the previous host.]

“So you are the Parasite from that time.”

[Parasite — something that lives in another being. Yes, I am something like that.]

“Your kind can change your hosts this way. How many people have you sacrificed until now.”

[Sacrifice — there are objections to that concept. The question of how many is one I can’t answer. I cannot remember that.]

No one tried to interrupt the conversation between Tatsuya and Pixie.

Everyone was anxiously focused on them.

“You say that you don’t remember most things?”

[Wrong. When we move to a new host, what can be inherited is only knowledge that separates with the parasite. Memories connected to the personality are lost when we transfer.]

“I see, so you don’t know what kind of person the previous host was, and you say you can’t remember if it was one person, two people or even a multitude.”

[That is right. Your understanding is correct.]

“Aside from the answers to my questions, can you relate impressions that you had. Does even your kind have emotions?”

[Even we desire to survive.]

“In short, you want to say that the existence of your likes and dislikes is derived from what you have decided is beneficial or harmful to your survival.”

Tatsuya temporarily stopped speaking,

“However, I do not intend to discuss the origins of emotions right now.”

He quickly returned to asking questions.

“What should I call you?”

[We do not have names, so please call me this individual’s nickname, Pixie.]

“Did you draw that knowledge from the electronic brain?”

[That became possible when I acquired this body. But regarding the individual’s nickname, it is because until now, that is what you have been calling me.]

“Well then, Pixie. Are you an existence hostile to us?”

[I am your underling.]

“Mine? Why?”

[I want to become yours.]

The parasite housed within Pixie directed a noticeably passionate gaze in Tatsuya’s direction.

[I was awakened from my sleeping state by the thoughts of that girl — her individual name is “Mitsui Honoka.”]

After a cut off shriek, a groan that leaked out of a blocked mouth reached Tatsuya’s ears.

When he quickly looked behind him, he saw Miyuki and Erika, restraining Honoka’s mouth together.

[We are drawn to strong thoughts; those thoughts mold the nucleus of “self.”]

“Strong thoughts? Are all types of thoughts alright?”





[No. Only highly pure thoughts can give birth to a self of our kind.]

“By highly pure, do you mean deeply buried thoughts of simple desires?”

[That’s correct. I think the closest concept in your human words is “prayer.”]

“What kind of ‘prayer’ awakened you?” was not asked by Tatsuya. He already had that answer and because he understood that, asking more questions about that was nothing but suicidal. Nonetheless, although Tatsuya didn’t ask, Pixie started to passionately state her own origin.

[I want to devote myself to you.]

Behind Tatsuya’s back, the moan did not intensify.

[I want to be useful to you.]

There were indications of a struggle behind him.

[I want to serve you.]

It might be a powerful struggle, the people restraining her seemed to have started erratically panting.

[I want to become yours. I want to dedicate all of me to you. That is the prayer that awakened me.]

If her mouth wasn’t being blocked, Honoka would probably be screaming.

[As I have already stated, because the previous host’s “memories” are erased, I do not know what kind of thought drew “me” into this world. And now, the core of my structure is the desire “to belong to you.” I am already an underling to you.]

A thump, the sound of three people hitting the floor could be heard; Honoka had probably reached her limit, was no longer capable of standing, and had taken down Miyuki and Erika as she fell.

However, Tatsuya showed no response to Honoka’s shyness.

“An extremely intriguing story.”

Tatsuya’s consciousness was occupied not by “emotion” but by “knowledge.”

“If the fact that your kind has an ego is unexpected, then the fact that your kind is persistently passive is also unexpected. Essentially, you are claiming that your kind did not wish to come to this world.”

[Originally, we just existed; “desire” is manifested according to the host.]

“That struck home. Well, there will be another opportunity to ascertain responsibility… Pixie, you said it was alright for you to be commanded by me.”

[That is my “desire.”]

“So then, obey my command. From now on, using psychic power without my permission is forbidden. This changing of the expression is a type of psychokinesis, right? That is also forbidden.”

“As you have commanded.”

As her own proof of her words, Pixie replied in an awkward voice.

The smile disappeared from that face. The mechanism’s structure changed back to the former synthetic face.

Nonetheless, it seemed like a strange smile could be seen in that synthetic face.





Chapter 12




“I did not think an apparition could possess a robot.”

“Probably because it’s a humanoid type, or something like that. An artifact spirit, unbelievable.”

Tatsuya replied to Miyuki, who had a look on her face that said she still didn’t really believe it, in a manner that said he didn’t want to believe it.

The siblings were not talking in their living room, but in their personal car. This car was not a commuter that they shared with the public, but Tatsuya’s personal property. The name on the form said it belonged to his father, but the money for the purchase had come from his earnings as Taurus Silver.

As for why they were not using a commuter that was as cheap to use as a bus was half a century earlier, Tatsuya had a personal car in order to deliver Miyuki to places in a secure and prestigious manner.

Not many people were aware of it, but Miyuki was the daughter of a good family, in other words an “Ojou-sama.” And a very high class one.

As part of her training for her position, she underwent studies in addition to her schoolwork.

Thanks to the special circumstances of the Yotsuba, she never went anywhere that might cause her to encounter Mayumi, but she still received private tutoring in order to hold her own at the highest levels of society, so she had to go to them in style.

Of course, there was a Driving Control Artificial Intelligence, and the luxury car was built to be bulletproof, heat resistant and had an anti-impact system installed; Miyuki continued to speak inside it while wearing a gloomy expression that did not suit the gorgeous clothing she was all dressed up in.

“And so Onii-sama… What do you intend to do?”

“By what, do you mean how I’m going to deal with Pixie?”

On the other hand, the dark jacket he wore couldn’t be called formal, exactly; it could be said that Tatsuya was dressed more like a high school student while making a face that failed to become a wry smile, as it was more of a halfway expression.

“Because, there is no way I can take it home with us. Perhaps I’ll just have to come up with a proper excuse that I can give to the school.”

“…You can’t take it home? Pixie wanted you to do that…”

Miyuki asked in a voice that had some fear mixed in it.

“There is no way it can enter the house.”

This time Tatsuya’s face was smiling as he replied.

“We know very little about the biology or nature of Parasites. There’s no guarantee that the Parasite was not lying.”

According to folklore, youkai[7] did not lie; only humans that lied had been Ama no Jyaku[8]’s weakness as a youkai.

Despite the fact that youkai who could not lie and youkai who did lie only existed in stories, at the time, no one there had doubted the words of the Parasite that claimed to possess Pixie, but it was something unbelievable to Tatsuya.

“Its claim that it was created from Honoka’s thoughts is not without proof. Since Mizuki saw the ‘traces’ that had been left behind. But other than that, we only have its word for it. Since we don’t have any way to know what kind of abilities it has, there is no way I’m going to keep it close to us. What if Pixie has some way to communicate with other parasites, calling them closer to it while we are sleeping? It would be the absolute worst situation. At least until I can confirm that it has no means to contact the other organisms, I will not hear of such foolishness.”

When she heard him state his decision in a bland tone, the shadow disappeared from Miyuki’s face in the twinkling of an eye. “But if that’s so, how can you trust the answers you get from cross-examining it; is there no way you can know?”

“That is the same condition that applies to interrogating human prisoners of war. The authenticity of the extracted information is something that can be decided only from our side.”

Some stiffness still remaining in her face, Miyuki was erasing the traces of happiness on her face through her willpower.




It was not all that big and not all that removed from common sensibilities; at the entrance to the elegant, western style house, Tatsuya handed off his role of guard.

Even though it was called a hand-off, it was nothing more than verifying the person’s face.

The classroom where Miyuki took piano and etiquette lessons (it might be better to call it a school) was prohibited to men. Even bodyguards, the accessory of the rich and powerful, were not allowed to enter.

“As usual, when the time comes, I will come to get you.”

“Yes, I will wait for you to come.”

Therefore inevitably, they would have this conversation at the time of the exchange.

By the way, the time he would come to pick her up was in two hours. Because he would have to use half that time if he returned home, it was normal for him to pass the time in a neighborhood food shop.

Tatsuya entered the name of the family oriented restaurant he had chosen into the GPS system. If he went into an alcohol-oriented shop dressed in more adult clothes, he would not be sent away, but he did not feel like doing that today.

He would have his evening meal at home, so he only ordered a drink. Normally, a customer who stayed for two hours and only bought a drink would be a problem for the shop, but whenever he was waiting for Miyuki, he ordered something expensive no matter what kind of shop it was. So it was alright not to worry about unintentionally causing harm.

Even if he got a dirty look, all he did was pretend he did not see it.

Tatsuya took up position in a vacant seat and did not open up a publication website, but just gazed out the window.

He looked like he was just daydreaming.

Tatsuya, himself, was not concentrating on anything.

Nonetheless, what he was doing was the complete opposite of the usual meaning of “daydreaming.”

He was not focusing his mind, but diffusing it.

Wider and wider, with Miyuki and himself as the two focal points, he laid his perceptions over every nook and cranny in the area.

This was not looking down from a bird’s eye view, but looking at things from the point of view of the information dimension.

It was not an elliptical sphere around the double focal points, as it had nothing to do with physical distance; Tatsuya fixedly concentrated his “eye,” intensifying his contact with the law of cause and effect within Link space.



So that he wouldn’t miss even one thing that could harm Miyuki.

Because he had this “eye”, he overcame the barrier of his gender and could be employed as his sister’s only guard.

To be correct, he did not normally use this “observation field.” Normally, he operated this unconsciously; right now he was consciously using it and even intensifying it.

Suddenly invoking his vision of the relationship of cause and effect left him open to “accidents;” namely leaving his body behind in the physical dimension by incessantly using it; when he was in link space, any wound he suffered wouldn’t heal. Becoming engrossed in “observation” was a situation that could indeed make him switch his mind to that side.

Even if he called it Link space, the dimension did not really have that kind of meaning.

The ways you were able to see something formed part of a framework of recognition.

Also, even if he called it Links, it did not mean he saw red strings or black chains connecting people; he could read no more than the information related to cause and effect. Perhaps someone else would be able to see red strings or black chains if they used those symbols; the images Tatsuya used pointed out the existence of what he realized were focal points jutting out behind the scene indicating the existence of cause and effect and events, etc.

In theory, the way he did things could be used to predict events; however, Tatsuya still could only read information on the “present” and twenty four hours of the “past.” As a result, it was extraordinarily effective at searching for enemies. It was probably equal to having an innate skill at remote viewing, though it was better than that because it had the potential to distinguish enemies with precision and range.

Within that observation field, the information about the looming adversaries was displayed.

They were not after his sister; he, himself, was the one they were coming after.

(I am a failure as a guard.)

Since he, himself, had become a target, he was exposing the person under his protection to danger. Calling himself a failure as a guard was not an insult he usually inflicted on himself.

However, he was not able to lose himself to the whispers of despair or remorse that were never quite voiced.




Lt. Colonel Virginia Barans made a slight nod when she heard the report that the troop emplacement was complete.

Prior to the current operation, they had analyzed the target’s daily habits and the fact that there were so few opportunities to attack had shocked her.

Moreover, the target almost never played at night like a child.

The target trained every morning before his morning commute at the Ninja Dojo where they could not interfere with the target at a moment’s notice.

(There were many americans who would have made this type of mistake as she did just now.)

He had gone somewhere on his bike the past two Sundays but he had quickly lost his tail and even using the observation satellite, they still had absolutely no idea where he went.

The only thing they understood from two weeks of observation was that he was no ordinary high school student. They had just about concluded that he was an agent of a special ops group. They had doubts because the target did not have any special connections (to be correct, they assumed he didn’t) but their investigation was not quite futile.

Lt. Sirius had already established the degree of difficulty of getting to him when he was with his younger sister. The target did not spend much time alone, much less, in places where the potential to escape was slight — this evening was one of those few chances.

“Lt. Sirius, can you hear me?”

When Barans spoke to the dedicated radio device, she immediately received a reply from Lina. The girl was standing by in a nearby park as planned.

This was the operation.

“Stardust” members disguised as robbers would break into the restaurant, and make a non-lethal attack. And if it was possible to capture the target, abduct him. If they received a counterattack then, exchange battle while fleeing and lead the target to the park where Lt. Sirius was waiting.

It was a vague plan, but under conditions with a large number of uncertain elements, this was as detailed a plan as it could be; she didn’t just practice combat operations in order to make a good show for her superiors, Barans had learned to practice in conditions as close to actual combat as she could.

After all, in chess, you were able to see all of your opponent’s moves, so only elaborate tactics were useful in it.

(There was concern that Stardust might be completely destroyed in the first phase however……)

That possibility is slight, Barans tamped down on her own uneasiness.

She could however decide to abandon the operation in case of failure, but Stardust were also modified magicians whom the USNA had poured their magic technology into. That these five men could be destroyed by one boy in the middle of his teen years was unthinkable.

Even if the target was as she believed him to be a user of an unknown strategic class magic, there were numerous cases where magic that was aimed at causing large scale destruction was useless in personal combat. If the target possessed destructive power of the strategic class magic, then it was even more likely that he could not use it unless he was prepared to kill himself as well.

Unless he had a special tool like Brionac.

(Even if they were wiped out, all records of Stardust had been erased so it was impossible to determine their identities.)

Therefore, even if the operation failed, it wasn’t necessary to worry about consequences, thought the Lt. Colonel putting an end to her speculations.

She seemed to be purposely not thinking about Murphy’s Law.




After she had finished her business with Barans, Lina did the final check on the tactical magic weapon, “Brionac”, in the station wagon that was parked in the park’s parking lot.

It was constructed for her use, and no one but her could use it; it was a super weapon such that even she who was the commander of the USNA magician troops was not allowed to choose when and where she could use it. While it was a portable weapon, its maximum power was equivalent to the main armament of a battleship; although it had such destructive power, its range and output could be freely controlled. It had an absurd outward appearance: it was a thick pole about four feet in length.

About two thirds of it was about the same width as the handle of a tennis racket, and the remaining one third was a cylinder with a bigger circumference; at the border between the two, a box shaped stick about the right width and thickness for her hand was placed cross-like.

Even though it was called an inspection, the weapon worked purely by magic power.

The armament was combined with a CAD, it was a magic weapon.

The Brionac did not use electrical powered movement or springs. So naturally, she did not perform a mechanical inspection. So even if it was called an inspection, she was only checking the responses in stand by mode prior to invoking magic.



She knew that by this tool’s very nature, it could not have a complicated structure. However, when she carried the Brionac which looked kind of like a cane, a spear or a club, she had the strange feeling that she had become a heroine in a fantasy novel (or a game).

Speaking of strange feelings.

(There was no way she felt any doubts about the colonel’s abilities but……would it go well?)

Essentially, Lina doubted that the crude operation would be effective against Tatsuya.

Lina also understood that a too detailed operation wasn’t combat effective.

Nevertheless, the main phase of the operation was to be completed by the five men who were operatives at the “Stardust” level, and she felt that she wasn’t going to have to endure a difficult wait. She was concerned that the possibility of them being wiped out quickly was probably quite high. Tatsuya is satellite class, no, he had fought above the level of four Stars member in an actual battle.

Tatsuya was a dangerous opponent; however, at first, Lina had thought Miyuki the tougher adversary.

Nonetheless, such thoughts had now completely disappeared.

Any inclination to treat Tatsuya lightly due to his lower rank were gone now.

She was able to realize recently that the embarrassing defeat she, herself, had suffered was not in any way due to her being careless.

If she had called his bluff, she might have been able to see his weirdly limitless true strength. And then, she really had no idea what would have actually happened to her.

—What could the magic that turned “Dancing Blades” to dust be?

—What on earth was the technique that cancelled the effects of “Muspelheim”?

At the time, she thought it was simply the bonds of the intermolecular forces being destroyed.

She thought the activation sequence had been neutralized.

But the instant she started to think about what could possibly do that, Lina’s mind froze.

She became aware that such a thing couldn’t be done.

At least, no one in the Stars could, herself included.

Destroying the bonds of intermolecular forces was one thing.

On the other hand, cancelling the effects of Muspelheim.

Neutralizing magic required interference power exceeding that of the magic being neutralized.

Even if she conceded that he had greater interference power than herself who was a Sirius, at that time, he had also affected Miyuki’s magic.

In that frozen area, her own Muspelheim and Miyuki’s Niflheim had battled for supremacy.

As the two opposing activation sequences had clashed, only the effects had cancelled each other, the magic had not been neutralized. In order for magic to be neutralized, a calculation sequence must overwrite the magic sequence.

In short, at that time, if the resources that Tatsuya commanded had neutralized the magic then he had invoked over twice Lina’s interference power.

The moment she thought of that, Lina became unable to quell the shaking in her body.

If that was really possible, then Tatsuya must secretly posses a technique that used power of that magnitude.

If there was a method other than neutralization to cancel the effects of magic, then it would also destroy more than the magic sequence.

Lina also knew that attacking with a high pressure stream of psions was also a means of destroying a magic sequence but at that time, there was no sign of that.

It had not been destroyed by an outside attack, it had been destroyed by interfering with the inner information structure — the Stars vice commander, Benjamin Canopus might have been able to figure out that Tatsuya had used “Gram Dispersion” to do that. However, Lina was unaware of the magic known as Gram Dispersion.

She had been young (immature might be more appropriate) when she joined the Stars troop; unlike a normal girl, she had an abundance of combat experience but aside from that she had not been able to take enough time to acquire enough knowledge. Of course, compared to a normal (magic) high school student, she had a large variety of knowledge, but the quantity of knowledge you have is limited by the time spent acquiring it. No matter how well she was versed in the knowledge she had, information she hadn’t learned could not exist in her mind.

The unease gripping Lina was brought about by the lack of time studying caused by the deficiency of her ability to expand her experience. To put it simply, the girl was too young to be the commander of the Stars.

It might be better to say that it was the embodiment of the weaknesses of the abhorrent practice of the doctrine of complete relying on strength to determine leadership.

Until now, that weakness hadn’t really affected her, but now she had a mission outside her home country with insufficient support staff against an opponent like Tatsuya who had not only had opportunities to acquire combat experience but had formidable knowledge and technical skills, and she was paying the price for her deficiencies.




Tatsuya was not a battle junkie. At least he thought so, and so far any fights he had taken part in hadn’t actually been started by him. Essentially, they were all for the sake of defending Miyuki’s safety and prestige.

That being said, he was not a practitioner of nonresistance. He possessed the youthful idea that it was necessary to fight and win to protect peace.

(Hmm, five men……)

They were parked across the street in an SUV. Tatsuya deliberately hesitated to confirm the number of men in position to spring from the car even now.

In this situation, if you wanted to flee, you should be able to do so. It should be alright to retrieve the car by remote control later.

The decision only took a second.

He finished settling his bill on the table terminal and stood up.

They probably saw that, as they hurriedly opened the SUV’s door.

Tatsuya went to the entrance at a quick pace.

The shop’s entrance was directly across from the SUV.

The five men who were wearing something like ski masks stood in the road. They had gotten there about the same time Tatsuya left the shop.

The eyes in the masks were blue, red, black, brown, and gray.

They were color contacts worn to completely disguise the fact that foreigners were committing a crime, but it’s possible that that wasn’t the reason. On the contrary, it didn’t really feel like they were trying all that hard to conceal their appearance. Perhaps, they had confidence that they had concealed everything about their identities aside from their faces.

The attackers seemed a little perplexed at the fact that Tatsuya was standing right in front of them.

Nevertheless the exchanging of stares did not continue for long.

Tatsuya moved.

He neither advanced or retreated, he walked out on the road past the line of vision of the men.

A feeling of astonishment came from them,

Tatsuya was distancing himself from them without changing his pace.

Just as the distance of five meters was going to become ten meters, the attackers came to their senses.

The small clink of a gun being leveled at him reached Tatsuya’s ears.

This was not a gun shaped CAD, this was a weaponized device that combined a CAD with a submachine gun.

This armament alone was enough to serve as a confession from them that they were USNA magicians.

Western European, Eastern European, and New Soren did not use complicated mechanical weapons.

The only ones aside from the American army who might use such an elaborate weapon would probably be Japan’s Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.

From the unfolding of the activation sequence, he understood that the rubber bullets would be electrified upon firing and release their charge upon impact. Probably, it was some type of taser gun. Apparently, they had received some kind of order to take Tatsuya alive.

Tatsuya had already thrust his right hand into his pocket and was holding the grip of his CAD. And he had used his fingers to find the trigger and put his finger on the switch.

With his back facing the masked men, Tatsuya pulled the trigger on the CAD.

He quickly turned around and kicked the surface of the road.

The parts of the submachine gun made a dull sound as they scattered all over the pavement which Tatsuya could hear as he was running away.

All these actions were stuffed into the interval when his opponents were frozen in shock.

Just as Tatsuya entered the period where they were all without weapons, his enemies were finally released from their stupor.

The shock was probably too much for them, Tatsuya thought, but all this might be unavoidable.

Under normal circumstances, in order to interfere with an object under the influence of someone else’s magic, it was necessary to have interference power that obviously exceeds the other person’s magic power.

In the cases where the other magician was physically touching the object, the level of difficulty went way up. So it could be said that it was close to impossible for the CAD and Armament devices to be instantly destroyed by magic for a number of reasons.

However, it would be a mistake to believe that this is why the men were surprised.

The magic used by them was the magic that would make the rubber bullet electrified upon firing and release their charge on impact. The target of their magic hadn’t been the guns but the bullets. The bodies of the guns were connected to the CADs but the breech-blocks, the percussion devices and the rest were mechanisms completely isolated from the CADs.

Originally, for the sake of maintenance, the weapons were constructed to be easily taken apart into pieces; something Tatsuya’s magic could easily manipulate. The reason they had been shocked until now might possibly be because until now they had believed that the Japanese were probably aficionados of swords, the way Americans were probably aficionados of guns.

Of course, Tatsuya was not just casually thinking about such a thing.

Those thoughts he had made out of reflex when he saw his adversaries’ shocked faces were only running in the back of his mind. The focal point of his mind was on taking out whatever means they were going to use to attack him in this interval.

To Tatsuya there was no reason not to capitalize on this.

However, this was a public thoroughfare.

This was not a busy street, this was not late at night, there were passersby, and traffic cameras here and there. Killing them would cause various problems.

Therefore in the presence of so many reliable witnesses, he did not want to display “disintegration” magic. So it was best if he did not disintegrate the parts.

All that thinking was packed into that interval.

Tatsuya stuck out the back of the palm of his hand.

His target was the stomach.

Aiming at the solar plexus didn’t take much work.

He used flash cast just as the bottom of his hand struck.

The invoked magic was an oscillation type.

From the touch of his palm, his opponent’s body was filled with oscillating waves — that was what was supposed to have happened.

However, his magic splattered. Tatsuya realized that not from the feelings from his hand but from the “eye” he observed with.

He immediately jumped to the side.

He felt a wind blowing up from below.

His afterimage was pierced by a glossy black knuckleduster worn on his adversary’s fist.

He escaped to the side and switched to the back and sent a vibration wave through the man one more time.

The man’s body fell to the ground from the single attack that came from his blind spot.

Even so, the man’s ability to resist magic was astonishing.

In spite of physical touch increasing the amount of information about how to weaken the armor that was part of the magic he was launching against the man, the man’s reflexively invoked interference power had wiped it out. No matter how power is put out, the magic was emitting from an inferior virtual magic area; so ordinarily, this was impossible.

(Modified body — no, probably a reinforced human.)

While he was jumping and dodging the attack from his enemy who had stood up and resumed his stance, he was accessing information on his opponent’s body and investigating this living organism.

From the report on the warped structure, this was not simply DNA modification; unmistakably the report showed results of multiple preposterous reinforcements.

(With their bodies like this, how are these guys even moving?)

To Tatsuya who had “observed” hundreds of people on the brink of death, the fact that these guys could collapse at any time was obvious.

It would be more appropriate for them to be in hospital bed receiving intravenous drips than to be waving around knives and guns.

Despite that, they had this vitality.

They were like shooting stars just before they burned out.

Without a doubt, they were stardust trapped by the earth; their bodies whittled down by the blaze of the radiance they could not endure emitting.

If it was at this level, then they would never accept themselves failing; there was no way to know what kind of recklessness this type of irregular opponent would commit.

It was somewhat risky, but he had to finish them off quickly.

With that, Tatsuya’s objectives changed. Within his mind, he quickly redrew his plan for his upcoming attack.

—After jumping even further back to gain distance, his hand reached toward the CAD in his pocket.

—As he took it out, he performed a fourfold invocation of part separation.

—This would certainly be able to halt his opponents.

As Tatsuya was solidifying the image, by coincidence just as he was doing that.

A man intruded on the scene.



Chiba Naotsugu was rushing.

Unbelievable, a street fight suddenly starting was unanticipated. The excellent data on the classroom educational records had left him with the preconceived notion that Tatsuya had a timid introverted personality.

He was about eight hundred meters away from the boy who was the focus of his observation and protection assignment on the third floor terrace of a mid-sized building. The dossier said his target was extremely sensitive to his surroundings, so he had kept his distance and it led to this screw-up.

Running down the stairs was also a waste of time.

Maintaining his specialized skill, he jumped off.

Continuing in that fashion, Naotsugu kicked the surface of the road.

Naotsugu’s mastery of the acceleration magic (formerly a sage’s skill) made it possible for his running speed to reach 120 kph for a short distance.

At this distance running was faster and swifter than using a car.

It took him about thirty seconds to arrive.

Along the way, he sensed two invocations of oscillation type magic.

He was able to see from behind the fight, an attacker receive a bottom of the palm strike and tumble down onto the road.

Within his mind, Naotsugu murmured, “did that boy use magic arts?”.

The dossier did not mention this information.

Since this was not information worth concealing, the dossier makers had probably not gotten a hold of this detail.

There seemed to be various other hidden gems of information.

Naotsugu’s interest in the observation target — in the current situation, he was switching it to subject of protection — “Shiba Tatsuya” deepened inside him.

Good grief, just what is his fighting ability…

Nevertheless, there would be other chances to check that out. Naotsugu was a person who drew a line between private and business matters. (At least, he thought himself as such.)

He pressed the switch on the armament device he was holding in his hand.

The short baton morphed into a kodachi.

Naotsugu had modified the newly developed product that the Chiba clan had just begun to supply to law enforcement for his personal use.



He preferred convenient, easily replaced, general use weapons to unique high quality weapons like “Ikazuchimaru” and “Orochimaru”.

Weapons were fundamentally tools to be used and replaced. Besides, even famous blades became dull with use.

It was an ironic thought for someone who styled himself as “one of the world’s greatest magicians in combat within a three meter limit”.

The boy which he had to protect made a great leap backward.

The information contained in the dossier concerning the troops facing the boy displayed itself in Naotsugu’s brain.

His opponents were Stardust — modified magicians attached to the USNA, no, they were weapons made from the bodies of magicians. A suicide squad constructed of magicians who were certain to have no more than a few years left to live who had been strengthened and altered. In Stardust, there existed groups that had various abilities. Naotsugu was able to learn that the unit that the boy was now facing were soldiers modified for close combat.

If I don’t have long to live then I don’t want to die a futile death…… They had been brainwashed to turn their thoughts in that way without a doubt, but Naotsugu did not think of it as evil. Instead he felt sympathetic, they were gambling their lives on a mission — not theoretically — literally.

Nevertheless, that made them dangerous opponents.

Suicide soldiers were the toughest soldiers in the world.

No matter how skilled the boy was, they were probably too much for a high school student to handle.

Naotsugu interposed himself between Tatsuya and Stardust.

Tatsuya had already grasped that he was under observation. He had even known that it was the USNA and another party.

Nevertheless, he hadn’t anticipated intervention within this short time period. Tatsuya had believed that the other party would remain as onlookers.

The fact that the newcomer turned his back to Tatsuya probably meant that the newcomer wasn’t an enemy at least in the current situation.

He even knew who this person was from the profile he’d seen when the man had intervened.

Erika’s second eldest brother.

However, Tatsuya did not know the reason why Naotsugu was lending Tatsuya his assistance in this fight.

“Shiba-kun”

Tatsuya had also not expected to be spoken to.

“My name is Chiba Naotsugu. I am the elder brother of your classmate, Chiba Erika.”

That the man would personally identify himself was also unexpected.

“I will deal with this situation. Retreat behind me.”

As expected, there was not an explanation, but this was not the occasion for that.

“Thank you.”

If he was going to say leave it to me then Tatsuya wasn’t going to contradict him.

As he retreated at a rapid pace, Tatsuya discerned indications from Naotsugu’s back that he was going to make an under shoulder swing.

Naotsugu had probably expected him to make some kind of “I will fight, too!” statement.

Unfortunately, Tatsuya did not have that kind of egotistical personality. If a specialist said fall back, all he would do is meekly obey. —As long as it was to his advantage.

Naotsugu’s sudden intrusion confused his adversaries for several seconds.

Since one opponent was already down, the four remaining masked figures produced guns from somewhere and pointed at Naotsugu.

CADs answered the speed factor that was significant in modern magic.

Even so, taking off the safety from a gun is faster than constructing the magic sequence needed to process the activation sequence. At this distance, it wasn’t necessary to spend time aiming.

These men were probably extremely accustomed to real fights. Rather than relying on their unique magic skills, they chose an option that eliminated the hindrance to speed without hesitation. Abandoning magic did not mean not using it at all, a movement type magic — an activation of magic that halted flying objects was simultaneously proceeding. Probably, to deal with any airborne tools their opponent might have.

They were armed with guns and shielded with magic.

They were using their faculties to their best effect. As he thought, their true fighting potential had probably been hampered by their need to “to capture Tatsuya alive”. Don’t ask questions, just destroy the enemy; without a doubt, that was their original fighting style. The fighting style was extremely pragmatic and sufficient to take down the average enemy.



However, Chiba Naotsugu was not an ordinary opponent.

Faster than the men could pull the trigger, Naotsugu had closed the distance. Unquestionably, aside from the man Naotsugu had closed with, they had all lost sight of him. His speed was such that even Tatsuya would have lost track of him if he hadn’t been concentrating.

As he passed by, the kodachi flashed. He had added a black border to the edge of his blade.

The hand holding the gun fell from the wrist down. The point of repulsion produced by the edge of the blade of the kodachi as it moved from left to right parted skin, flesh, and bone with astounding pressure.

His adversaries were probably aware of the instant slashing attack executed with the Weight Type magic “Pressure Cut”.

Unconcerned with their comrade’s cry of pain, the three men redirected their guns at Naotsugu.

The bullets penetrated Naotsugu’s afterimage.

To the BGM of glass breaking and painful moans, Naotsugu bridged the gap between his opponents.

Despite it not being the swiftness of the gods, the soldiers could not keep him in their gun sights.

Their fields of vision were too full of real and false images of their target.

Even Tatsuya watching from behind was not confident that he’d be able to perceive Naotsugu’s true whereabouts if he was facing him at point blank range.

The root of the trick was to continually cycle between charging and freezing.

Due to Naotsugu repeatedly charging, freezing, changing direction, charging, and freezing, afterimages were being produced in his adversaries’ retinas.

Originally, the logic of sword technique abhorred suspension or in other words “being still”. Without going into the fine details of the theory, being still was stiffening the muscles, halting the movement of the legs meant fixing the legs in a state where the leg muscles were stiffened, being still could lead to collapsing.

However, that was the case when only the muscles were moving.

Naotsugu used “Beginning” in short, by controlling his body’s first movement with magic, he could switch from being at a complete standstill to top speed without a time lag.

Nevertheless, saying this was easy, doing it in combat was incredibly difficult.

Movement proceeding thought was the natural state in the world of martial arts. It was said that if you did not move before thinking then you would never become first class.

What Naotsugu was doing could be called the body’s movements surpassing thought even beyond the invoking of magic.

Come to think of it, with the “Pressure Cut” from a little while ago, Naotsugu went from being an onlooker observing the adversary from far enough away in the area that he could not be sensed to instantly invoking and instantly finishing off an opponent. To do that without being able to read his opponents intentions, he probably did not take any countermeasures.

This switching, indeed this on and off speed was without a doubt the essence of the techniques that made Chiba Naotsugu one of the top ten martial artists in the world, Tatsuya thought.



While Tatsuya had been analyzing Naotsugu’s fighting abilities, all of the masked men had been rendered powerless.

Naotsugu lowered the hand holding the kodachi.

He did not visibly relax his vigilance, but it felt like he was less tense.

It was the same for Tatsuya as well.

He must thank him for his assistance, as he took his third step towards Naotsugu,



an intense sense of danger assaulted Tatsuya.

Naotsugu probably sensed it as well. Tatsuya hit the deck and Naotsugu raised his kodachi almost simultaneously.

Afterwards,

a shining ray attacked Naotsugu.

The kodachi was attacked by the shining ray — a high energy plasma beam.

As the blade took a direct hit, the beam parted left and right.

The point where “pressure cut” would form a point of repulsion was probably bending the raging stream of plasma.

However, the electromagnetic wave’s influence would not be enough to block it.

The shining ray disappeared.

Strangely, the plasma beam disappeared before it reached the buildings along the road.

Naotsugu’s body trembled slightly as he stood stock still with his kodachi raised. His muscles were probably convulsing from being bathed in the electromagnetic waves shielding him at point blank range. It was probably like having his whole body receive the full force of a stun gun.

Tatsuya directed his eyes to where he estimated the ray had been fired from.

Far away, in the center of a roadway shrouded in darkness.

Floating leisurely in the street light,

with deep crimson hair and golden eyes.

Something cane-like was pointed in this direction. The masked magician, “Angie Sirius” was looking at Tatsuya with a gaze of invitation.

Afterword




Firstly, to those who picked up this book, I offer my gratitude from the depths of my heart. To the first-timers, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, and if this is not your first time, I thank you for following this series.

This series, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, is one with quite a fair amount of characters but, the guest heroine for this “Visitor Chapter” is the first of its kind to appear I believe. It is also the first time a blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl appeared too, is it not?

Regarding this series getting an unusual blonde, young lady, during a meeting for the ninth volume, I had a conversation with the one in charge that went something along the lines of:



In-charge: “You know, I kind of really like those good-for-nothing, lazy beauties you know.”

Me: “Well, Lina does fit those characteristics a bit but she is more of a striking, yet worn-out beauty. However, she is very cute, is she not? Rather, those types of characters are very cute.”



Thus, Lina gained a new character attribute. Well, from the start, she was molded to be an unfortunate young lady except during battle, but she wasn’t this incompetent. … … But she is definitely cute, wouldn’t you agree?

Speaking of characters that have changed, a bitter highlight in this volume, shows Kuroba Mitsugu’s personality is completely different from before. In truth, it is because of the influence of the Drama DVD on me. The honourable voice actor who played Kuroba Mitsugu’s nicely adlibbed line completely reformed his character.

My, an actor’s performance is quite incredible right? It was quite an experience thanks to the combined efforts of everyone involved in the production.

Now then, the next volume is finally the end of the “Visitor Chapter”. This middle volume (II) had “Continued in the next volume!” but don’t think that (III) will say some sort of incredibly mouthful line like “To be continued in the final volume of this chapter” so please be relieved. The first year portion of the story is brought to a close with a suitable climatic ending I prepared so please do look forward to the next volume “Visitor Chapter (III)”

Notes




Schrödinger’s Cat: Is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead, a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. The thought experiment is also often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger coined the term Verschränkung (entanglement) in the course of developing the thought experiment.



Schrödinger’s cat: a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity (i.e., a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that after a while, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality collapses into one possibility or the other.

Beyond Good and Evil, Aphorism 146: He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.



Wer mit Ungeheuern kämpft, mag zusehn, dass er nicht dabei zum Ungeheuer wird. Und wenn du lange in einen Abgrund blickst, blickt der Abgrund auch in dich hinein.

Sake: Often spelled saké in English, is a Japanese rice wine made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran. Unlike wine, in which alcohol (ethanol) is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in grapes, sake is produced by a brewing process more like that of beer, where the starch is converted into sugars before being converted to alcohol.

The brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer in that, for beer, the conversion from starch to sugar and from sugar to alcohol occurs in two discrete steps. Like other rice wines, when sake is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. Furthermore, the alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer. Wine generally contains 9%–16% ABV, while most beer contains 3%–9%, and undiluted sake contains 18%–20% (although this is often lowered to about 15% by diluting with water prior to bottling).



In the Japanese language, the word “sake” (酒, “liquor”, also pronounced shu) can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage called “sake” in English is usually termed nihonshu (日本酒, “Japanese liquor”). Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labelled with the word seishu (清酒, “clear liquor”), a synonym less commonly used in conversation.



In Japan, where it is the national beverage, sake is often served with special ceremony – gently warmed in a small earthenware or porcelain bottle called a tokkuri, and sipped from a small porcelain cup called a sakazuki.

Courtesy Chocolate: Or Giri choco is given out of politeness and does not indicate that the giver has any romantic feelings for the recipient.

White Day: In Japan, girls give gifts on Valentine’s day and one month later boys give a return gift on White Day.

Julie Andrews Style: Dame Julia Elizabeth “Julie” Andrews, DBE is an English film and stage actress, singer, author, theatre director and dancer. Andrews, a former child actress and singer, appeared on the West End in 1948, and made her Broadway debut in a 1954 production of The Boy Friend. She rose to prominence starring in musicals such as My Fair Lady and Camelot, both of which earned her Tony Award nominations. In 1957, she appeared on television with the title role in the musical Cinderella, which was seen by over 100 million viewers.

Youkai: Are a class of supernatural monsters, spirits and demons in Japanese folklore. The word yōkai is made up of the kanji for “bewitching; attractive; calamity;” and “spectre; apparition; mystery; suspicious”. They can also be called ayakashi (妖), mononoke (物の怪), or mamono (魔物). Yōkai range eclectically from the malevolent to the mischievous, or occasionally bring good fortune to those who encounter them. Often they possess animal features (such as the Kappa, which is similar to a turtle, or the Tengu which has wings), other times they can appear mostly human, some look like inanimate objects and others have no discernible shape. Yōkai usually have a spiritual supernatural power, with shapeshifting being one of the most common. Yōkai that have the ability to shapeshift are called obake.

Japanese folklorists and historians use yōkai as “supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants”. In the Edo period, many artists, such as Toriyama Sekien, created yōkai inspired by folklore or their own ideas, and in the present, several yōkai created by them are wrongly considered as being of legendary origin.

Ama no Jyaku: Is a demon-like creature in Japanese folklore. It is usually depicted as a kind of small oni, and is thought to be able to provoke a person’s darkest desires and thus instigates them into perpetrating wicked deeds.

One of the amanojaku’s best known appearances is in the fairytale Urikohime (瓜子姫, “melon princess”), in which a girl miraculously born from a melon is doted upon by an elderly couple. They shelter her from the outside world, and she naively lets the amanojaku inside one day, where it kidnaps or devours her, and sometimes impersonates her by wearing her flayed skin.
