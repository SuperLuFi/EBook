Introduction



	Early Sunday morning, June 9th, 2097. Exact time: 5:06.



	The east of the central part of the Izu Peninsula was attacked by large-scale magic.



	The magical attack, presumably carried out by the Strategic Class Magic “Tuman Bomba” of Igor Andreivitch Bezobrazzoff, a state recognized Strategic Class Magician from the New Soviet Union, partially or completely destroyed 27 private villas. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but 11 people were seriously injured.



	An explosive attack of this magnitude had so few casualties, because it was in a sparsely populated district, and there were few guests in the villas in the off-season. All the wounded were from people working in the villas as managers.



	However, the undeniable fact was that Japan’s territory was subjected to an unreasonable attack, threatening the life and property of its civilians.



	On the same day, the Japanese government appealed to the international community, expressing its vehement protest against the assailant, whose identity had not been established yet, and asked to extradite the offender without calling the country to which he was drawn to.



	Despite the fact that the attack was quite sudden, and was also held early at dawn, the Self-Defence forces were able to notice it from a small distance in the surrounding areas.



	However, the fact that the video shown was convincing, proved that it was an unreasonable proactive attack, it was also suspected that the Japanese army had previously predicted the sudden attack and used it to obtain material for diplomatic negotiations, and that they left the civilians to die.



	Some courageous journalists directly asked the representatives of the Self-Defense Forces about these suspicions, but the Self-Defense Forces, naturally, categorically refuted them as “groundless, false accusations“.





Chapter 1



	Seeing Minami lying on the floor, Miyuki froze in place and cried. But this panic was only briefly present.



	No, she was still in a panic. But her body came out of its stupor.



	“Minami-chan!“



	She rushed to the on the ground lying Minami and knelt beside her. Near Minami, Pixie was already present, checking her pulse, by putting her fingers on Minami’s wrist. Miyuki sat down on the opposite side and brought her hand in front of Minami’s face.



	Her panic-stricken appearance weakened a little when she discovered that she was breathing.

	However, Miyuki turned pale when she touched her neck.



	“It’s cold... Her pulse is very weak... Onii-sama!”



	Miyuki raised her eyes to Tatsuya, looking at him with a hopeful glance.



	Minami’s figure reminded Miyuki of Honami’s last minutes, and how Tatsuya was unable to help her.



	“Pixie, what is Minami’s condition!?”



	Tatsuya also did not conceal his impatience. He turned to Pixie with a rather rude tone.



	“No injuries, but the temperature, pressure and pulse—Are all at a dangerous level, Master. With her condition, there is a possibility that she could die from exhaustion.”



	As if sensing Tatsuya’s impatience, Pixie responded with active telepathy, and not with a mechanical voice. Tatsuya forbade Pixie to use telepathy without permission, but now he wasn’t going to rebuke her for it. This was not the time to discuss such problems.



	Tatsuya stretched his left hand to Minami. In this hand, he had no CAD.



	In his right hand, he still held the CAD “Trident“ in the form of a large pistol, which he used to intercept the attack. He had no time to get his left handed CAD for “Regrowth” or to get the cartridge for “Regrowth”.



	Tatsuya activated “Regrowth“ with his own powers.



	Regrowth is the magic of returning the Eidos to its original state. It tracks the history of the Eidos and its changes and then overwrites the current Eidos with a copy of the Eidos from the selected state (in most cases, this state is free of damage or wear).





Phenomena are accompanied by information. Events whose information is overwritten are changed according to this information.



	Overwrite the information and change the phenomenon. This is modern “Magic“.



	The Information of the “Eidos” about the phenomenon has a restorative force, and the prescribed false Eidos is overwritten by the original Eidos over time. Therefore, the changes caused by magic are unstable.





However, the “Eidos from the past“ is undoubtedly an information body that describes the actual phenomenon itself. If there are no contradictions in the information, the Eidos will not be corrected. However, the adjustments that are inherent to the flow of time remain.



	Objects that have been rewritten to the information of their own past using the Eidos are now fixed to the present state with the time that has elapsed without being affected externally from that point on. The time is traced back to the time that the event is what it was previously, and the world is overwritten and overwritten from that point in the past solely for that event.



	“Regrowth“ used by Tatsuya does not modify the “effect“ in causality, as it does in usual magic, but instead it changes the “effect“, by modifying its “cause“.



	This magic, going against the flow of time and redefining the definition of healing, was directed at Minami.



	—He read the information about the body of Minami, rewinding back the changed history.



	He couldn't find the cause of her exhaustion.



	—He read the history of changes to the Psion information body accompanying the physical body and mind.



	The cause of exhaustion still could not be found.



	Tatsuya went even deeper into the information about a girl named Sakurai Minami.



	—He read the history of changes in the structure of the Psion information body that binds the physical body to the mind with his own mind.



	This was difficult for the former Tatsuya. Five years ago, he couldn't do this for Honami.



	Although he has grown up a lot since that summer, he might not have been able to do this six months or a month ago. Access was possible because it was nothing more than a Psion Information Body. Although he could read the general information, it was difficult for him to read the full details of the structure.



	But the current Tatsuya could do it.



	Free from Pledge, Tatsuya’s true power returned. Apart from the fact that he was now free to use Material Burst, there were also other changes.



	The correspondent area of his Eidos used for “Regrowth”, has also returned to its initial state, thus meaning it has also expanded. Now he could track and copy the Information Body known as the “Imaginary body“, The Psion Information Body directly associated with the mind, which he could not reach with his power before.





He saw that the imaginary body was torn in many places.



	It was in a state covered with holes, representing a lack of information in these particular places.



	The Psion Information Body seemed to have holes because its regenerative ability weakened.

	But this was not the cause of Minami's weakness, but the result.



	Even if he restored the damaged Psion Information Body, if he did not return the initial regenerative ability, it cannot be called a fundamental cure.



	However, if you leave the damage to the Information Body associated with the mind, damage to the physical body that accompanies the Information Body will occur, and the state of the body would only worsen.



	The Imaginary Body transmits the commands of the mind to the physical body. The damaged Imaginary Body transmits the damaged information to the physical body.



	The physical body receives the erroneous order to destroy from the mind.



	As a result, the physical body can only work with the efficiency inherited from the damaged state, despite the fact that it is not physically damaged.



	But it was necessary to do at least this, as first aid, as a temporary measure, so it would not end with irreparable deterioration.



	Tatsuya’s Regrowth returned the Psion Information Body and mind to its original state.



	He rewrote both the structure of the Psion Information Body accompanying the physical body and the structure of the Psion Information Body that binds the physical body before the attack was received.



	The recorded information of the past became the information for the present after the adjustment was automatically made taking into account the time that has elapsed since then.



	“—Her temperature has returned to 35 degrees Celsius. Blood pressure and heart rate have also come out of the danger zone.”



	Pixie, using telepathy, reported the improved status.



	However, there were no signs that Minami was going to regain consciousness.



	“Pixie, bring a futon and lay Minami on it.”



	“Yes, sir.”



	“Miyuki, preheat the area around Minami to the temperature correlating with her current body temperature.”





	“Yes!”



	The home automated robot, controlled by Pixie, came into motion. The magic of Miyuki began to act on the floor and air.



	Not confirming the result of these actions, Tatsuya ran to the phone. No, he didn't call 119*.



	Instead he called the main house of the Yotsuba.



	[Common number for all emergency services in Japan.]



	“Tatsuya, did you want something?”



	Despite the early morning, Hayama appeared on the screen without any traces of his clothes being messy. Tatsuya was still in his pyjamas. But Tatsuya didn't have time to take care of this, and Hayama didn't reproach him for it.



	“I apologize for my appearance.”



	Starting with such an introduction, he immediately moved to the main topic.



	“— The villa was attacked by Long Range Magic. Presumably, Tuman Bomba was used.”



	Hayama eyebrows raised sharply. That was the only sign of his surprise.



	“Was there any damage?”



	Hayama asked, without any signs of tension in his voice.



	“I have no scratches on me or any on Miyuki. However, Minami came out with symptoms that resemble the overheating of the Magic Calculation Area. I did what I could to help, but she needs special treatment.”



	When Hayama heard the phrase “overheating of the Magic Calculation Area“, his face changed slightly. Although the concern on his face could only be seen for a very short period of time, it was sufficient enough to understand that as a senior employee of the Yotsuba family, he could not ignore the “overheating of the Magic Calculation Area“, which was allegedly the cause of death of the first head of the family, Yotsuba Genzou.



	“—... I got it. I'll take care of the hospitalization. I'll send Hyougo, please wait a bit.”



	“I'm counting on you.”



	After he fulfilled his goal, Tatsuya interrupted the connection.





	◊ ◊ ◊



	Around the villa, where Tatsuya lived, a barrier with a radius of about 1 kilometre was built. It was a field using the Mental Interference Magic of the Tsukuba family, a side branch of the Yotsuba family.



	Because of this magic, people will peel away from this place, since they are unconsciously forced to avoid it. And it concerned all people who have no resistance against Mental Interference Magic, whether they are magicians or not. And also this magic served as a “human sensor“, telling the user about the people that infiltrated the covered area.



	However, around midnight, one specific vehicle was parked inside the area covered by the barrier. It was equipped with adjustable suspension, painted in camouflage colours. Although at first glance it was possible to determine that the vehicle belonged to the Self-Defense Forces, the users of the barrier of the Tsukuba family did not notice its existence. In addition, although they drove along public roads, there were no reports on the civilian systems.



	An armoured vehicle that could withstand the explosive waves of Tuman Bomba, it was almost pressed completely to the ground due to the fact that the adjustable suspension was lowered to its fullest. There were 4 soldiers inside the armoured vehicle.



	“—... Psion sensors did not find any new responses. Apparently, the magic attacking from a distance is over.” One of the soldiers told the commander sitting in the front passenger seat.



	“Understood.”



	Sitting in the front passenger seat, Lieutenant Colonel Kazama, who is the commander of the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion, responded to the words of his subordinate, without turning his head.



	This was not an impoliteness on the part of Kazama. Although some would think it could be explained as their status as Commander and officer, but he did not turn because he was busy.



	Kazama has been sitting motionlessly for several hours with half opened eyes, a straight back, and his fingers clasped in a specific gesture.



	This was not just when the armoured vehicle stood still, but he was constantly doing it. His upper body was kept perpendicular to the gravity of the Earth and any movement of the vehicle was only transmitted to the wind.



	The barrier of the Tsukuba family did not spot the armoured vehicle thanks to the technique of Kazama.



	Magic that prevents detection, “Cloak of invisibility“ of the Tengu.



	To not be able to see although you could see.



	To not be able to hear although you could hear.



	This magic does not block or interfere with the light and sound waves, but interferes in the consciousness of people and makes them believe that “something is not there“.



	This magic was used to oppose the discerning barrier of the Tsukuba family, not letting the operator of Magic notice their entry in the barrier.



	The armoured vehicle remained unnoticed only because the technique of the Tengu, Kazama, surpassed the barrier of the Tsukuba family.



	Kazama did not move and was in full concentration because of his confrontation with the barrier of the Tsukuba family, so he had no time for anything else. Even for Kazama, who had the famous nickname “Dai Tengu“, it was difficult to resist a caster of the Yotsuba family.



	“Retreat.”



	“You got it. Completion of observation, preparing for retreat.”



	Following the short order of Kazama, the officer sitting in the driver’s seat turned back and handed out instructions.



	Each member of the squad took out their media from the surveillance devices issued to them. The two junior officers moved the devices to standby mode and one after the other reported that “preparation for retreat was completed“.



	“I’m lifting the body of the vehicle.”



	Simultaneously with the voice of the officer sitting on the driver’s seat, the suspension lifted the armoured vehicle from the ground. The armoured vehicle, literally lying on the surface of the earth, switched to the driving off-road mode.



	“Ready to depart.”



	“Hmm? Hold on.”



	Kazama did not give his permission to the officer to depart. Keeping his hands the same way, he opened his eyes which were half closed. Immediately after that the external microphone around the armoured vehicle caught the approaching sound of a motor.





	◊ ◊ ◊



	Around the villa, where Tatsuya lived, a barrier to keep people away was deployed. For this purpose, in a nearby small house, shifts were held between the Tsukuba family, a side branch of the Yotsuba family. As a result of their rotation, it turned out that the person who was in this house today, was Yuuka, who has inherited the right to become the next head of the Tsukuba family.



	However, the Tsukuba family did not realize the importance of the mission assigned to them, so they forced their crown daughter to be on duty at night. Awakened by the feeling of a wave of powerful magic, Yuuka flew into the room supporting the magic barrier in a sleepy form with a dress flung over her pyjamas.



	“Damage Report!”



	From the worn-out appearance of the next head of the family, the face of the young male operator was stretched. As the degree of exposure of Yuuka was zero, the young man’s confusion could be related to a kind of “love that comes once every hundred years”.



	“It looks like the ground part is ruined.” Still, he firmly answered her question.



	They could lead this relatively quiet conversation, because the bedroom and the barrier support room were located in the basement. The present part of the “Observation house“ (not for the observation of the villa, but for the observation of the people approaching the villa) was located in the basement, and the ground part was used as a disguise.



	“The reason?”



	Yuuka awakened from the shock waves belonging to Magic. Although she could guess and not inquire, but still being half asleep, she thought she could make a mistake and decided to just ask.



	“It was an attack of extremely powerful long-range magic. Presumably, an explosion was caused in the sky, and a focused shock wave was formed.”



	“A focused shock wave was caused by magic?”



	“No, it seems that the explosion was controlled directly to achieve this result.”



	“Hmm...”



	Frankly speaking, Yuuka did not understand this mechanism very well. However, she had a hunch about the magic that could combine both power and control.



	“Was it Tuman Bomba?”



	“Possibly.” The subordinate operator came to the same opinion.



	“What about Tatsuya-sama and Miyuki-san?”



	“The villa has no damage. I think they're all right.”



	Hearing this, Yuuka raised her eyebrows with doubt. She did no doubt that Tatsuya and Miyuki were uninjured. The doubt was due to the report that the villa itself was not damaged.



	“—... The focus point of the shock wave was Tatsuya-sama’s villa?”



	“It seems that the shock wave was stopped by a powerful magic shield.”



	“—... Chiho-san, what do you think?” Yuuka asked her newly appointed guardian.



	“Minami-san has fulfilled her duty.” Yuuka's new Guardian, Okazaki Chiho answered without hesitation.



	She also was one of the modified people of the Sakurai series. It could be said that it was another branch of the second generation of the series, derived from other fertilized eggs, different from Sakurai Honami and Sakurai Minami. She was 8 years older than Minami, and at first glance she didn’t look like a magician. Rather, she resembled an “ordinary servant of a small firm.“



	The magic which Chiho specialized in also followed the adjustment policy of the Sakurai series. Objective and heat-resistant protective barriers. The basis of specialization was protection against solids and heat, that is, mainly protection from physical objects and energy.



	If the shock wave was dispersed, it could be attributed to Tatsuya’s decomposition magic, if it was weakened, it would be Miyuki’s deceleration magic, but if it was stopped by a magic shield, it was Minami who specialized in the same Magic as her. —It was logical that Chiho came to such a conclusion.



	“Would you be able to do that, too?”



	Yuuka's question was offhanded, but Chiho didn't care.



	“Maybe I could. But...”



	“But what?”



	Chiho could not decide on her answer, but this hesitation only lasted for a short time.



	“But I'm not sure I can continue to do my duty after that. If you intercept that level of power, overheating of the Magic Calculation Area can appear.”



	The colour on Yuuka's face changed. Among the whole Yotsuba clan, she was a kind of doctor, or, you can say, a specialist in damage to the Magic Calculation Area caused by overload. Even when it came to a guardian of another person, she could not ignore it when there is a suspicion that serious damage to the Magic Calculation Area could have occurred.



	“I'll be ready in five minutes. You may accompany me.”



	“Can I help?”



	Chiho looked at Yuuka's condition and came to the conclusion that it would be difficult to change clothes in just 5 minutes, however...



	“Fine.” Yuuka did not refuse the help and returned to the bedroom.



	Chiho, unlike her mistress, was already dressed in a strict suit with a jacket and trousers and immediately went to the garage, so as not to lose time.



	Although the ground garage was almost completely destroyed by the explosive wave, its simple design helped because the car was not completely buried under the debris.



	Entering the car, it looked like a commercial SUV, but in fact it was an armoured vehicle with military level surveillance, so Yuuka remembered that it was necessary to check the state of the barrier.



	“Huh!?”



	“Did something happen?”



	Having heard the unwittingly surprised voice of Yuuka, Chiho, who had already started the engine and was ready to start moving, interrupted her actions and asked.



	“Intruders...?”



	“Did they get inside the barrier?”



	The unflappable tone of Chiho forced Yuuka to discard her surprise.



	“Yes, but they are extremely skilled. I'm worried about Minami-san too, but they should be given priority.”



	Chiho did not protest to Yuuka's decision.



	“I'll send a signal for an emergency mobilization of all our people.”



	Instead, she implicitly expressed her view that it would not prevent the presence of all the members of their group.



	“Yes, thank you. But we'll go ahead.”



	Yuuka understood Chiho’s intention, but did not follow this advice.



	“Okay.”



	Chiho didn't go against Yuuka's orders. She sent the SUV in the direction Yuuka specified. Chiho was sure that whoever broke into the barrier, she would be able to hold with her barrier* Magic until her allies arrived.



	[To clarify, in the original these “barriers“ are different words. The word for “barrier“, which does not allow people to enter, literally means “deterrence zone“. And the barrier used for personal protection was written with the same word as “Wall“.]



	If you took the villa as the centre, the intruders were at a ninety degree angle from them.



	“It's an armoured vehicle from the army.” Chiho made this conclusion, seeing its shape and masking colours. Yuuka did not know as much about cars as Chiho, but even for her it was obvious that the specific vehicle belongs to the army.



	“Let's talk to them. Stop over there.”



	Following the guidance of Yuuka, Chiho stopped the SUV so as to block the path of the armoured vehicle.



	“I think it's better to wait for reinforcements.”



	“—... Right.”



	This time Yuuka followed Chiho’s advice and remained in the car.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Looking at the relatively small SUV that stopped near the front of the armoured vehicle, an officer in the driver’s seat turned his eyes towards Kazama as a gesture to ask for further instructions.



	Kazama stopped holding his hands in the special gesture and clicked the lever to unlock the door.



	“Commander?”



	“Everybody wait in the car. Any actions that may be mistaken by the other party as hostile intentions are prohibited.”



	Giving instructions to his subordinates, Kazama left the armoured. Right after that he turned towards the SUV. The other side also had to understand that he wanted to explain the current situation as clearly as possible.



	Kazama waited for a reaction from the SUV, without taking any action, but no reaction ensued. So Kazama quickly noticed it. The place where they were at now was relatively open. This area was chosen to record the attack on Tatsuya’s villa, but the sparse woods could still block several lines of sight.



	And in these “blind spots“, people gathered. Only 11 people. Kazama’s intuition told him that they were all high level magicians.



	Both the doors of the driver and passenger’s seat of the SUV finally opened simultaneously.

	Looks like these are all their reinforcements. This conclusion came to Kazama.



	“My name is Tsukuba Yuuka. The eldest daughter of the Tsukuba family, subordinate to the main house of the Yotsuba family.” A young woman, who came out of the passenger’s seat, spoke with a layman voice. Between them was about 5 meters, but even in these weather conditions with the wind, there was no problem to hear what she was saying.



	“— and you are, as I see, Lieutenant Colonel Kazama from the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion of the National Self-Defense Forces?”



	Kazama was not surprised that she was able to identify him. No wonder that she knew him if her identity matched the way she called herself.



	“Right. I'm the Lieutenant Colonel of the National Self-Defense Forces, Kazama.“ He answered, still standing on the side of his armoured vehicle. He considered that the other side does not want to approach the distance for a handshake.



	However, contrary to his expectations, Yuuka went to meet him.



	Kazama quickly followed her example. Of course, to show a friendly attitude to the other side. But that wasn't the only reason. He was also concerned about what might seem cowardly, because he makes a young woman who looks at least 20 years old to approach the armoured vehicle in which his subordinates were sitting.



	The woman who came out of the driver's seat followed Yuuka. Looks like she's a bodyguard.

	Kazama guessed that she didn't stand in front of her because she had strong defensive magic.



	“So she is a guardian? Must be quite skilful.”



	Kazama has heard a little about the guardians of the Yotsuba family from Tatsuya. The fact that the woman who looks like a bodyguard was standing behind her was a “guardian“ could be understood by the accompanying atmosphere.



	“Lieutenant Colonel Kazama. You may not know, but this is area is the private property of the Yotsuba family.”



	While the attention of Kazama was directed to the woman, the guardian, Chiho, Yuuka managed to get closer to the normal distance for a conversation.



	“More precisely, it belongs to a real estate company, which is controlled by the Yotsuba family, but that does not matter. What are the Self-Defense Forces doing in private territory? And with such a thing.” said Yuuka, pointing her eyes at the armoured vehicle.



	She was wondering how Kazama would answer to such an unexpected question. As it was expected that they would not be discovered, no excuses were prepared.



	Kazama was very unfortunate that Yuuka's shift had to be today and yesterday. Other operators would not have been able to notice his cloak of invisibility.



	In fact, their invasion was discovered by Yuuka herself. She wasn't going to brag about it before Kazama, but he knew he'd underestimated them. He imprinted these reproaching thoughts in his memory to himself.



	“I beg you to forgive me, but I cannot answer as it is connected to the military.”



	After all, without inventing any excuses, Kazama laid out the “Joker“ card, which is usually applied to a civilian.



	“Is the military secret that you mention connected to the fact that civilians would be the target of another country's attack?”



	However, Yuuka was not one of those people who was frightened by the phrase “military secret“.



	“In this armoured vehicle... Is there any equipment for gathering information?” Yuuka asked, turning to Chiho who was standing behind her.



	“Yes. It looks like a model for exploration.”



	Although the answer of Chiho was not completely affirmative, the tone of her voice spoke of her confidence.



	“Don't misunderstand. We do not intend to oppose the Yotsuba family.”



	Not showing a drop of hesitation, Kazama responded to Yuuka's words, using not the phrase “civilians“, but the phrase “Yotsuba Family“.



	“Do you mean that the Yotsuba family are not civilians?”



	Yuuka immediately jumped after the hint left by Kazama. However, this question was also what Kazama wanted to hear.



	“Regardless of the formalities, you can't be considered completely non-combatant, can you?”



	“—... Formalities do not matter for civil servants?” This objection came after a short delay in time. This was proof that Yuuka could not deny Kazama’s argument.



	“Can you persuade me to abide by these formalities?” Kazama asked with a discreet smile.



	Yuuka had nothing to say.



	“Instead, I would like to know if the army was expecting an attack by Tuman Bomba?”— This question came not from Yuuka's side.



	Kazama hurriedly turned towards the voice that came from the shadows of the grove.

	Undisguised agitation appeared on his face.



	“Tatsuya...”



	“Tatsuya-san...”



	Kazama and Yuuka muttered his name at the same time.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	“Onii-sama, what is it?“



	Miyuki, sitting beside the bed of Minami, noticed the tension created by Tatsuya’s aggravation and directed her gaze on him.



	At the moment, Minami’s conditions had stabilized. Although she still did not regain consciousness, but thanks to Tatsuya’s Regrowth, she was no longer in a state of struggle for life.



	Tatsuya already changed his pyjamas to casual clothes to meet a helicopter that would take Minami to the hospital. When he returned to the canteen, where she was laid on a futon, he was no longer in a state of intense impatience. Instead it was tension from the sudden alertness to the presence of an enemy.



	Miyuki couldn't understand what Tatsuya noticed.



	“Lieutenant Colonel Kazama.”



	“Lieutenant Colonel Kazama!? And you did not notice him...”



	“I didn't notice him.”



	When Miyuki bashfully lowered her eyes, Tatsuya hurried to tell her that he felt the same.



	“It looks like he was discovered by Yuuka-san’s magic.”



	“Yuuka-san is here too?”



	It seems that Miyuki was not quite convinced that Tatsuya was not able to notice him, but apparently this question was more interesting to her.



	“The operators of the Tsukuba family use magic here, which does not allow people to approach. This was done on the orders of Aunt.”



	“Aunt-sama...?”



	Not knowing how to understand Maya's order, as if troubled about Tatsuya, Miyuki changed the embarrassment on her face to perplexity.



	“I'm going to go meet the Lieutenant Colonel. Miyuki, I trust Minami to you.”



	However, there was no point in speculating on the real motives of Maya. There was no point in making assumptions. It was useless even if these guesses were the truth. Before Miyuki could

	fall into a labyrinth of reflection, she returned to her consciousness and reminded herself that there are more important things to do now. Tatsuya, as he said, left the villa to meet Kazama.



	When Tatsuya reached the target, the dialogue between Kazama and Yuuka was in full swing.



	He asked the supporting magicians of the Tsukuba family to remain silent, and he merged with the landscape, and began to listen to the dispute between Kazama and Yuuka.



	Kazama would have noticed Tatsuya if his attention was not on Yuuka.



	Yuuka would have also noticed Tatsuya if her attention was not on Kazama.



	They were aware of each other as a 'user of Mental Interference Magic, with which one should be vigilant', so their attention to others was weakened. For Yuuka it was not critical, but for Kazama, the owner of the alias “Dai Tengu“, it must have been a serious omission. Tatsuya did not know this, but fatigue was undoubtedly in play here, having accumulated after the long concealment from the barrier of the Tsukuba family.



	“Is the military secret that you mention connected to the fact that civilians would be the target of another country's attack?”



	This question of Yuuka caused confusion in the thoughts of Tatsuya.



	The armoured vehicle, on which rode Kazama, was equipped not for battle, but to gather information. Besides, it was quite expensive equipment. If you think about it, you can guess that they came here today because they expected to be able to collect valuable data.



	As Yuuka said, it means that the Self-Defense Forces assumed in advance that there would be a sudden attack from Tuman Bomba...?



	Tatsuya could not dismiss such suspicion.



	“Can you persuade me to abide by these formalities?”



	Yuuka had nothing to say to Kazama. There was no extra time from the beginning. Tatsuya decided that it was no longer necessary to merely remain an observer.



	“Instead, I would like to know if the army was expecting an attack by Tuman Bomba?”



	“Tatsuya...”



	“Tatsuya-san...”



	Kazama and Yuuka with astonished faces answered Tatsuya, who went out of his stealth mode and came out of the shade of trees.



	“Lieutenant Colonel Kazama, answer me.”



	Tatsuya did not salute to Kazama. And also missed the usual greetings. Tatsuya didn't want his spicy tongue to dull from these friendly greetings.



	“... As I told Tsukuba-san, I cannot answer.”



	“In other words, the answer is yes?”



	“No comment.”



	Tatsuya met his gaze with Kazama and sighed a little.



	“Lieutenant Colonel Kazama. I feel obligated to you. So I don't want you to say something like that.”



	“—......”



	“If you had warned us in advance, we would not have allowed this sudden attack by the New Soviet Union.”



	“—... Are you sure that the sudden attack by long-range magic was carried out by the New Soviet Union?”



	Of course, Kazama showed interest in this. But there was one more important thing in the topic Tatsuya raised.



	“If you give justification to your words, then I could answer your question.”



	Justification that a sudden attack was carried out by the New Soviet Union. Even considering the concern that the promise may not be fulfilled, these words were enough to make Kazama change his mind.

	“The magic used for the sudden attack was activated from a railroad in the suburbs of Vladivostok.”



	“From a railroad?”



	“—This was the result of reading the information of the caster, which activated the magic, presumed to be Tuman Bomba.”



	“Did you discover Igor?” Yuuka unwittingly wedged into the conversation.



	“The casters is dead, but it was not Igor, it were two women.”



	“Women!” A surprised Yuuka exclaimed.



	“Two... Were they non State recognized Strategic Class Magicians?”



	Kazama, as expected, quickly understood the truth.



	“I do think that Igor did participate in this, but I specifically targeted those two women. And they were undoubtedly in the Far east of the New Soviet Union.”



	“If it was on a railroad, then was it a military train that came on the new Trans-Siberian highway?”



	For the Self-Defense Forces, this information was important.



	There were rumours that to activate Tuman Bomba, they had to use a large CAD, occupying a wagon train. However, this theory had no evidence.



	Moreover, at a time when magic resembling Tuman Bomba was used in the Soya strait, no such movement of trains was recorded. For this reason, the Self-Defense Forces were thinking about whether the information about the private train was wrong, and whether another magic, not Tuman Bomba, was used at that time.



	But according to Tatsuya, it turned out that this private train is actually involved in the use of Tuman Bomba.



	Although Tatsuya said, “The Magic is supposedly Tuman Bomba“, but by power and range of action, this magic was definitely Tuman Bomba. If this is not the case, it means that the New Soviet Union possessed another magic with high power and outbound range of action, besides Tuman Bomba.



Tuman Bomba or not, but it was clear that magic that represented a threat to Japan was launched using this private train. The resources used by the Army for observation were limited. These resources could be effectively distributed if the objectives of the monitoring were clarified.



	However, Kazama did not have time to plunge into a feeling of satisfaction.



	“Lieutenant Colonel, it's your turn now.”



	Tatsuya did not stand before Kazama, as a member of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion and as subordinate Kazama. It was a 'bargain' between them.



	“Did the Self-Defense Forces know that a surprise attack would occur at this place this morning?”



	“We didn't know completely. The exact date and time we could not predict.”



	“In other words, did you expect this place to be attacked? Why?”



	Kazama couldn't answer immediately. This question concerned the ability of the army to gather information. Although Tatsuya was part of the Self-Defense forces, he was not completely committed, so Kazama pondered on the question whether Tatsuya had the right to know for some time.



	“The Self-Defense forces... No, Her Excellency Saeki received information on the movement of Igor. And from that you made the assumption that I would be the target of a sudden attack?”



	Without waiting for the answer from Kazama, Tatsuya gave his guess, which was nothing different from the truth.



	Kazama said nothing. Seeing that he could not give an answer, Tatsuya realized that his guess was correct.



	If they were warned of a possible sudden attack, it would not have come to such a situation that Minami had to crumble from depletion. He wouldn't even let Miyuki and Minami come to this villa. If Tatsuya was alone, there would be no damage, even if he was directly impacted by that attack.



	“We have a wounded person, so I'm going back to the villa.”



	Tatsuya pacified his discontent. Even if he reacts with discontent towards Kazama, it would be meaningless.



	“Then, Lieutenant Colonel, and Yuuka-san, goodbye.”



	“Wait, Tatsuya-san. The wounded person you mentioned... Is it Minami-san?”



	The outgoing Tatsuya turned around, hearing the voice of Yuuka.



	“Yes. Yuuka-san seems to understand Minami’s current condition.”



	“Minami had no injuries that could be called “injuries.“ However, the Magic Calculation Area, the unconscious area of the mind, was “wounded“. Tatsuya used the word “wounded“ in this sense, and Yuuka understood this.



	“She needs to be sent to the hospital urgently! Should I ask my family for help?”



	Yuuka anxiously offered to help with transportation. Despite the fact that she said so, she could not suppress her anxiety.



	“The main house has already organized a helicopter. It should arrive soon...”



	“So I have to go back.” Tatsuya hinted with these words of his.



	“Is that so? Then... Take care.”



	“Thank you very much.”



	Slightly bowing to Yuuka, Tatsuya turned around again and left.



	Yuuka glanced at his retreating figure and was filled with anxiety.



	Kazama to the end did not say a word of concern about the mentioned “wounded“.





	Chapter 2



	The hospital where Minami was placed in was located in the immediate vicinity of the building in Chofu.



	Of course, this wasn't a coincidence. The building in Chofu, where Miyuki moved to, was built as the headquarters of the Yotsuba family in Tokyo. Measures concerning sick and wounded had been considered from the beginning.



	Tatsuya returned together with Miyuki to the new house which was a multi-storied building.



	Miyuki wanted to go along with Minami, but the doctor politely refused. Miyuki did not become stubborn when she was told that her magical power, which could unwittingly be released, could interfere with her treatment.



	“Is everything going to be okay for Minami-chan...” An unconcealed murmur came from Miyuki, sitting next to Tatsuya, with a voice filled with anxiety. Apparently, she didn't even think about hiding those feelings.



	“I think her life is no longer in danger.”



	When Miyuki heard this from Tatsuya, which were words coinciding with her expectations, her facial expression became a little less disturbing.



	“—... Right. Tatsuya-sama used “Regrowth“. Nothing bad should happen.”



	Tatsuya looked at Miyuki’s eyes, filled with indecision. He did not want to escalate her alarm, but he also did not want to be insincere to her. Deceiving her with empty words of consolation was not his goal.



	“—... What I did were only temporary measures, like first aid. I couldn't cure her completely.”



	He first laid out the bare facts, but he added an additional explanation before Miyuki’s anxiety began to grow.



	“But we managed to avoid her state weakening to a deadly level. In addition, Minami is the second generation. Her resistance to magic must be stronger than that of the first generation, Honami-san.”



	“Yes, that's right!”



	Miyuki raised her gaze. In search of hope and support, her look met the look of Tatsuya.



	“With the change of generations, magic is strengthened in the genes... The same can be said about us, modified people, right?”



	Tatsuya was disgusted to hear how Miyuki called herself a “modified person“.



	“The second generation of ordinary, modified people are more stable than the first. There are some exceptions, but there is no doubt that this is the trend.”



	Usually, modified people lack vital stability. There have been many cases of sudden deaths without preconditions, as well as deaths from sudden weakness.



	And at the moment there is no established theory about the reason for it. However, there were many hypotheses. One of the most convincing hypotheses, and that to which Tatsuya inclined, is the “Limiter Failure Theory“, which asserts that “People with modified bodies use magic with a removed Limiter“.



	According to this hypothesis, the spirit of people initially did not have the possibility to use magic. The Magic Calculation Area is not a unique feature of magicians, it is present in the spirit of every ordinary person. But since the use of magic has a load exceeding the limits of the human mind, usually the limiter set in the unconscious area blocks its activity by 100%. In other words, it is completely frozen.



	But in rare cases, there are magicians whose mind has a strong durability against magic, and such people have slightly removed this limiter. In such cases, their limiter is not set to 100%, but to 99%, or sometimes 98%.





	Even if it is just 1-2%, the difference between total zero and the amount that allows the use of actual magic is very significant. Even with 1%, the person gets the opportunity to use magic, which he initially should not use.



	Using the muscles as an analogy, the use of the Magic Calculation Area can also increase its power. Bones and tendons increase in physical strength to support the growth of the body, similarly the spirit increases in durability against the excessive use of magic. This is what the theorists of the “Limiter Failure Theory“ believe. They believe that the limiter’s release of the Magic Calculation Area and the enhancement of magic grow in parallel.



	Using this, it is possible to understand that ordinary magicians by using magic gradually increase their natural durability to use magic, and thus gradually remove the limiter further. But magicians with modified bodies have artificially created conditions for the use of magic, and the limiter does not work under these conditions, as well as the claims under the “Limiter Failure Theory“.



	The Magic Calculation Area which should grow alongside the spirit’s magic durability doesn’t develop at the same rate because they are not both “turned on” at the same time. The spirit will continue to be damaged whenever the magical load exceeds its durability, which spreads to the physical body and effects it in a negative way.



	Speaking of which, it is believed that the magical endurance of the spirit is an inherited trait. Neo-Lamarckism, which claims that the acquired skills of the physical body are inherited, also claim that in the field of mental adaptation of magic, this is observed as a phenomenon that “Magic genes adapt” over time.



	If this way of thinking, which can be called “Lamarckism of Reason“, is true, then the “second generation“ is born with the same magical endurance of “The first generation“. Therefore, the “Third generation“ will inherit even more resilience, because of the reinforced “second generation“.



	However, all these are conjectures. There is no guarantee that they are true.



	However, “second generation“ Minami was said to have a much higher resistance than that of the “first generation“ Honami. When Miyuki thought about it, her feelings calmed down a little.



	These feelings of tragedy and guilt disappeared from her expression. Her strong sense of guilt was due to Minami sacrificing herself for her.



	Seeing this, Tatsuya smiled at Miyuki, hiding her anxiety in the depths of her mind.



	The fact that Miyuki also has a modified body was an unpleasant thing for Tatsuya. If he could, he would prefer not to believe it, but there was no reason to deny it. He had no sense of discrimination or detachment for someone with the most advanced modified body. But it was unpleasant to him that someone was forcing their hands on Miyuki’s body, even though it was before her birth. It can be said that Tatsuya unconsciously felt the desire to be a kind of sole owner.



	But if you remove such emotions and accept the fact that Miyuki has a modified body, then he will not be able to ignore such serious fears.



	For example, the concern about whether or not Maya was able to overcome the instability of a first generation.



	If you adapt the words of Maya to the previously mentioned hypothesis, then Miyuki’s limiter works fine despite her modified body. Or is her magical endurance so high that the limiter is not needed at all?



	Tatsuya didn't have a way to check this. Even now, completely freed from his seal, he could not reach the realm of the spirit.



	So the only thing he could do was believe.



	If what Maya told Tatsuya was a lie, then Miyuki had the disadvantages of a modified person.

	And if Miyuki was awaiting the same fate of modified people in the form of a sudden death...



	Tatsuya simply could not imagine such a future.



	Then he couldn't live. Tatsuya wasn’t sure that he would be able to live without her.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	At 2 p.m. Japanese time, the Japanese government protested to the international community about the sudden attack of an unknown country.



	However, the USNA learned about the fact of that the Japanese peninsula Izu was attacked with Long Range magic in almost real time.



	The USNA’s spy satellite recorded the response of a powerful magic in the far region of the New Soviet Union at the same time that the Izu attack was made. There were no such people in the Government or in the USNA’s Army who could not relate these two events. But there were those who were happy and those who were unhappy.



	Lina was also informed about it, but only a few hours later.



	The headquarters of STARS in New Mexico, still Saturday, June 8th.



	In the evening, at a meeting after completing training, STARS officers discussed this shocking news.



	The report said that one of the regions of Japan, which was not a distant island or a sea surface, close to the capital area was attacked by Strategic Class Magic of the New Soviet Union early in the morning.



	“The target of this attack is the newly discovered Japanese Strategic Class Magician, Tatsuya Shiba.”



	In the coaching room, the assistant to the non-magician base Commander Walker explained the details of the message.



	“What is Tatsuya Shiba’s condition?”



	This question was not asked by Lina. She was in shock at the moment and was not able to ask the connected questions. The one who asked the assistant to the base Commander was Canopus.



	The assistant looked at Commander Walker. Having confirmed that Walker nodded, he replied:

	“The details are unknown, but it seems that he was not hurt at all.”



	The reaction among the magicians present varied.



	Lina didn't even try to hide her relief.



	Canopus strongly squeezed his lips, as if fearing that Tatsuya would retaliate.



	Arcturus was depressed, apparently due to the fact that the assassination mission will not be cancelled.



	On Vega’s face, who received the same task, on the contrary, a daring smile surfaced.



	Colonel Walker spoke at this point.



	“A directive was received from the general staff that our country occupies a non-intervention position in this matter. It looks like we won't be allowed to show ourselves this time, but you should still be ready.”



	The voices of confirmation were heard from all of them. Although Lina was the only one who could not agree with it, they all still understood their situation.



	“Then, you’re dismissed.”





	Thirteen of the best magicians of the USNA saluted at the same time after Walker’s order. When they, led by Lina, began to come out one after the other, a voice came from the back, stopping only one person.



	“Captain Arcturus, I'll ask you to stay.”



	According to the rules, the operations assigned to STARS are passed through Lina, but there were exceptions, when the orders were passed by her, and they were not so rare. And Lina herself was not very disturbed by it.



	Lina and the 11 Captains of the different units, as well as the assistant came out, and in the coaching room only Walker and Arcturus were left.



	This room was equipped with a serious listening protection system. Which, of course, was being used at the moment.



	“Captain, activate a Soundproofing field.” Walker told Arcturus before they continued.



	“Understood.”



	With doubt on his face, Arcturus, following the order, blocked both internal and external sounds.



	“Installation of a Sound insulation field is complete.”



	Not having Magic himself, Walker could not verify whether Arcturus told the truth or not.

	However, he nodded quietly and immediately moved on to the main issue.



	“Captain. It was decided to carry out the experiment, which we talked about earlier.”



	Arcturus’s face became stressed.



	“Is this about the Micro Black Hole experiment?”



	He unconsciously lowered his voice, though he had just used magic to stop any sound from escaping.



	“Yes. The venue will be the same as last time: the National Particle Acceleration Institute in Dallas.“



	“The time: Next week, June 15th at 11 o'clock. You are the best user of Lunar magic among STARS. Although I think you can handle it if there are any parasites, but if you need to, we may send the 11th Unit to help you.”





In the army of the USNA, Mental Interference Magic was called Lunar magic. Arcturus was a powerful Mental Interference Magic user. But Arcturus, like those specializing in this kind of magic, had little real combat experience.



	He inherited the blood of his ancestors, Native Americans. His grandmother was one of the only remaining thoroughbred shamans of the Native American tribes. His predisposition to Mental Interference Magic is considered to be inherited from this grandmother.



	Because of this pedigree, he was usually expelled from missions against magicians of Ancient Magic specializing in Mental Magic (they can also be called “sorcerers“ or “Shamans“).



	“Sorcerer“ is the USNA’s term for magicians specializing in Ancient Magic and that belonged to the Native Americans and they would call black magicians that use Ancient magic “Shamans”. To be more precise, white and Asian people called Native American magicians using Ancient Magic “Sorcerers“, and they called black magicians using Ancient Magic “Shamans“, so Arcturus showed his sympathy towards people of the same race because of the prejudice he has faced.



	And in the 11th Unit, there were three magicians specializing in lunar magic, and without any racial prejudices. They were often in command on operations against Ancient Magic users, because they specialized in Mental Interference Magic, and were able to withstand attacks that attacked the mind.



	“No, I'll be enough.”



	Arcturus also understood that he lacked real combat experience. But he also had high conceit. In addition, he believed that the presence of STARS in this matter should be kept to a minimum.



	“Is that it? I got it.”



	The desire to engage as few people as possible also coincided with Walker's opinion. In this conversation it was decided that only Arcturus’ 3rd Unit will be sent to the experiment.



	“The 6th Unit will be on duty outside the lab. If you find suspicious people, tell them immediately.”



	This meant that not only the 3rd Unit would be involved in the operation.



	Three members of the 6th Star class, who received the code names of the Orion constellations: Mintaka, Alnitak and Alnilam, who are also called “Orion team“. And this was not a coincidence, because the 6th Unit assembled a team of “hunters“, Magicians specializing in persecution.



	“You got it. But Captain Rigel...”





“Don't worry. The experiment will be conducted in secrecy.”



	For a moment, relief could be seen on the face of Arcturus when he heard Walker.



	The goal of the Micro Black Hole experiment is to expose a Japanese agent. To be sure of their capture, the cooperation of other groups is desirable. But Arcturus, mistaken about the dangerous event, did not want people from other groups to learn about the experiment.



	Walker had to agree with him. Although their motives were not used to harm the other, the result was that the information was hidden from the public.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	The Japanese government announced a magical attack on the area where villas were built on the Izu peninsula, and heavily criticized the person that fired the attack, without specifying who it was. At the same time, they stressed that this was meant as nothing more than a hindrance to their magical military power.



	At the same time, they indirectly criticized the anti-magic movement, pointing out that the expulsion of magicians would not only be a humanitarian problem, but would also reduce the defence against magical attacks of other countries, which would jeopardize the lives of the citizens of the country.



	However, they withheld that the target of the attack was also a magician. The fact that the target was Tatsuya and that Minami became injured was strictly forbidden to be spread around. However, full concealment of the facts was impossible.



	Those who knew where Tatsuya was, easily tied him and this magical attack together.



	And there were also those who had guessed the truth, because they possessed sharp magical perception skills.



	Immediately after the government's announcement of a sudden attack, 1st Lieutenant Fujibayashi received a personal phone call. A personal phone call during service was possible because the call came from a virtual hotline with the Kudou family, established for emergency with the permission of the headquarters.



	“Kyouko-oneesan? It's Minoru.”



	“Minoru-kun?”



	The virtual hotline only passed his voice. The other side’s display said “Kudou Family“ and it was impossible to know who it is was until you heard their voice. It could be her grandfather or her uncle, or even her aunt. But the fact that it was Minoru, was quite unexpected for Fujibayashi.





“I'm sorry for interrupting you and your work.”



	“It's all right. I'm not busy right now.”



	This wasn't a lie. Prior to that, she had been preparing documents for the government's announcement, drawing on the data obtained from Kazama at the Izu peninsula. Now, when the press conference was over, all involved people had no work to do.



	“So, do you have any urgent business?” Fujibayashi asked, hiding her excitement. This private line was rarely used. and Minoru used it for the first time. He wasn’t being egotistical... Or at least he did not show such behaviour before Fujibayashi, Minoru usually could not afford to call her while she was working. It was natural, therefore, that Fujibayashi feared that there might be an emergency.



	“It is not urgent, but there is something that I would like to know at any cost... This is about the government's announcement that was just made.”



	“I’m listening.”



	Fujibayashi was willing to listen to what was going to be discussed, but answered with the usual intonation of her voice.



	“That artillery magic attacked Tatsuya-san, didn't it?”



	“How do you know this....?”



	This was an unexpected response. Albeit from Minoru, but she had concealed this information on the orders of the government.



	This was how strongly astonished she was. Tatsuya’s close friends from First High could know his whereabouts, so it is not surprising that they could relate this attack in the morning to him.



	However, even within First High, there were very few people who knew that Tatsuya was in the villa on the Izu peninsula. Maybe he heard Tatsuya’s location from Saijou Leonhart or Yoshida Mikihiko, whom he met last fall...?



	But this assumption of Fujibayashi turned out to be wrong.



	“I felt strong magic waves collide with each other in the East. But at the same time, I felt that one of them was Tatsuya-san’s…”



	Fujibayashi did not know how to respond to the words of Minoru. If what Minoru said was true, then it could mean he had a sensory ability that exceeds Tatsuya’s Elemental Sight.





Tatsuya’s Elemental Sight can “see“ everything of whatever he looks at. However, Elemental Sight requires “intention“ — the direction of the will. If you do not try to “see“ something, if you do not direct your will to something, then you will not “see“ it.



	He could passively “catch“ hostility directed at Miyuki, but this made his target in comparison much smaller. However, this time he could not feel it until the attack had actually begun.



	Conversely, if Minoru really felt the shock waves coming from Tuman Bomba, it means that he randomly perceived the activation of magic from a distance of almost 400 kilometres. Of course, Tuman Bomba is quite a powerful magic, but it was quite obvious that Minoru’s passive sensitivity surpassed Tatsuya. At least it seemed like this to Fujibayashi.



	“Minoru mastered Elemental Sight...?”



	“...Minoru-kun. Since when do you have such a powerful perception skill...?”



	Fujibayashi’s question was not answered.



	“Tell me, are Tatsuya-san and those with him alright!? How are Miyuki-san and Sakurai-san!?”



	Minoru did not hear Fujibayashi’s question. His attention was directed to the condition of Tatsuya and his entourage.



	... No. In fact, Minoru was not worried about Tatsuya or Miyuki...



	“Tatsuya-kun and Miyuki-san are fine. But Sakurai-san...”



	Although her intuition discouraged her, Fujibayashi could not lie to him.



	“What happened to Sakurai-san?”



	But when she heard the desperate voice of Minoru, Fujibayashi couldn't keep silent.



	“—... She's in the hospital. Dr. Yamanaka of the Battalion suggested that her Magic Calculation Area could be damaged due to excessive use of magic.”



	“Suggested? But did the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion provide any treatment? You were there right!?”



	“Minoru-kun, what has happened to you...?”



	He could not answer her last question. The Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion’s being there was only known by Saeki, Kazama, the involved members of the squad and a few other people from the Battalion. As well as Tatsuya, Miyuki and the Yotsuba family.



	Even the government did not receive a report on the specific people involved in the operation.



	Minoru should not have known that the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion was involved in the collection of information about the sudden attack.



	However, the words of Minoru were not a random guess. He confidently declared the participation of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.



	The Minoru who Fujibayashi knew could not do this. Her “cousin“ has long been, indeed, considered an outstanding magician. Fujibayashi believed that if it was not for his health, he would certainly be on the list of the strongest in the world. But he was not supposed to have this ability similar to clairvoyance.



	It was as if in Minoru possessed an evil spirit with forbidden knowledge...



	Her superstitious seemed like a fantasy.



	... If at that moment, she had not counted her intuition as a fantasy... The future could have been quite different.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Minoru was not particularly angry when he heard about the situation in the morning from Fujibayashi. Although he was disappointed, he already had a preconceived opinion of the military that they belong to everything insensitive, so he just decided that this was only natural.



	But instead, Minoru suffered from unbearable anxiety over Minami.



	The damage that the spirit receives from excessive use of magic meant that it was overheating the Magic Calculation Zone. This was the only disease that magicians had, and so far, it has not been clarified how to treat it.



	Genetically modified magicians are particularly affected by this disease. According to the knowledge obtained from Zhou Gongjin, the unstable health of Minoru was also caused by a problem in the Magic Calculation Area.



	In the case of Minoru, the limiter that constrains the Magical force at a level that the physical body can withstand is malfunctioning. Any ordinary magician can also break the Limiter if it exceeds the permitted working level of the Magic Calculation Area, for example, by excessively using magic during a battle. In Zhou Gongjin's knowledge, there was no way to restore it.



	“Maybe if I can’t get it cured, the Yotsuba family can... “



	This was not speculation, but a strong desire. He had nothing to do but to calm his anxiety, which he could not restrain.





“... I'm going to lose her. Maybe if I go meet her, I can check on her condition.”



	He could not believe that Tatsuya would allow his family member to die so easily. Even if he did not do it himself, she certainly achieved the necessary treatment from him.



	“I have to go and see her with my own eyes...”



	This was Minoru’s course of thought. He should go to school tomorrow. He had to visit a certain amount of days, when his physical condition was stable, but when he didn’t come, he could replace the missed time by passing a test or writing a report.



	Minoru decided he was going to skip school for a little bit.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Her awakening was unpleasant. Her body was heavy. Fatigue was felt in the whole body, as if the rest did not completely get rid of her fatigue.



	Opening her eyes, she saw a soft creamy coloured ceiling. After looking at her sides, she saw the walls of the same colour. As well as clean white bedding.



	An injection needle was inserted into her left hand.



	“This is... A hospital?”



	After realizing this, her memory came back to her.



	“... That's right! Miyuki!?”



	Minami tried to climb up, but realized that her body had weakened to such an extent that she could not do so.



	“Wow...”



	She tried to force her body to move, but her fruitless attempts ended only with a sigh of awareness that nothing was working.



	At that moment, Minami lied back down on her bed and heard a knock on the door.



	“—... Enter.”



	She was surprised at how weak her voice was.



	“I'm sorry for the intrusion.”



	“Miyuki!?”



	Her consciousness was still slightly clouded, but she could not help but understand who the voice belonged to.



	Minami weakly tried to rise again. The result was the same. Just a little bit of a head lift. But she quickly returned to her pillow.



	A painful groan again came out of Minami’s mouth.



	“Minami-chan!”



	The sound of the fast approaching steps was heard. In Minami’s field of vision, she saw the face of Miyuki, and was filled with emotions and excitement.



	“... Beautiful...”



	Even with such an expression on her face, the beauty of Miyuki was unearthly. The consciousness of Minami was filled with such irrelevant thoughts.



	“Minami, don't overdo it.”



	“Tatsuya-sama...”



	The consciousness of Minami, which was in the clouds, returned to reality when she heard the voice of Tatsuya.



	“— ... Are you two okay?”



	The first words of the awakened Minami were not of her own welfare.



	“Yes, we're fine. Thanks to you.”



	“—... It's an honour for me.”



	Tears came out of Minami’s eyes because of her emotions. She felt relieved that she was able to protect her mistress, and how deeply she was impressed by her awareness.



	“No, you need to rest.”



	“Stop trying to move Minami.”



	“If you want to talk about something, you can talk while lying down.”



	When Tatsuya said this, Minami stopped her useless attempts to rise.



	“Tatsuya, Miyuki, I'm very sorry.”



	Miyuki did not know how to answer to this unexpected apology.



	“... Why are you apologizing? The fact that we are left intact, is thanks to you, it’s not a lie or an exaggeration. It's true.”



	Even Tatsuya could not answer immediately.



	“But my strength was exhausted as a result. As a guardian, I need to fulfil my duty, which mean I need to defended my master to the end.... I couldn't fulfil this duty.”



	Her voice was very weak. Her body was also weak enough that it could not rise.



	But the light that filled Minami’s eyes when she spoke were her real feelings, not just a complaint that her spirit was weakened.



	“Minami, I'm not going to argue with you, because both your body and mind are exhausted. But I want you to hear two things.”



	“—... Okay.”



	Upon hearing Minami’s answer, Tatsuya sat down on a chair next to her bed.



	This reduced the height difference between their eyes, which should ease the impression Minami got from being stared at from above.



	“Minami, I consider your sense of duty to be commendable. However, it is also an indisputable fact that your magic was able to protect us from the shock wave caused by Tuman Bomba. You can't deny such an achievement.”



	“—... Yes.”



	Minami agreed only with words and did not nod. But she was not convinced to the depths of her soul.



	“That was the first point. And now the second.”



	Tatsuya spoke with a serious voice. Not only to Minami, but also to the nearby standing Miyuki, who simultaneously struggled to breathe.



	“I believe that I can trust you, Minami, but not only with the protection of Miyuki.”



	Minami lay and gazed silently at Tatsuya. This look suggested something like, “What are you going to do with me?“. In response, she wanted to get to know the meaning of her existence.



	“There are very few people I can rely on. Leo, Erika, Mizuki, Mikihiko, Honoka, Shizuku. Even though I trust my classmates from First High, I don't want to drag them into our situation. Now the Yotsuba family is my ally, but if I interfere with them, they will not hesitate to get rid of me. Fumiya and Ayako, I also trust, but they have their own work. Perhaps I cannot rely on them in an emergency situation. Also I cannot deny that in the near future, I can become an enemy to my master and to Lieutenant Colonel Kazama.”



	“And where does that put me?”, Minami asked with a glance.



	“Minami. You're one of the few I truly trust. So I want you to be near Miyuki not as a guardian, but as a friend.”



	“Not a guardian, but...a friend?”



	“I hope so. It's not coercion. But if possible, I'd like you to be near Miyuki. And to stay there as long as possible, and not die quickly as a guardian. At least until you find a partner for the rest of your life.”



	Minami’s pale face slightly blushed. Tatsuya’s mention of her possible marriage was too sudden for her. These last words caught Minami by surprise.



	“—... Minami-chan. I'll be happy if you're around. So I want you not to think of yourself as useless.” said Miyuki, sitting near Tatsuya and slightly leaning over to face Minami.



	Minami’s eyes were shedding tears again. At that moment, she realized that Tatsuya and Miyuki really cherished her.



	“So, please, recover, slowly. Restoring your health is the most important thing now.”



	“—... I got it. I'll get better as soon as possible. And when that happens, will I be able to serve Miyuki-sama again?”



	“Yes, it's a request from me.”



	Behind Tatsuya, the entrance door to the hospital room opened. Not looking back, Tatsuya guessed that it was a doctor and a nurse.



	“Tomorrow, we will come again.” Tatsuya said and he got up from his chair.



	“Minami-chan, until tomorrow.”



	“Yes. Tatsuya-sama, Miyuki-sama, thank you very much for visiting.”



	Miyuki, embarking after Tatsuya, exchange farewells with the on the bed lying Minami. After that Tatsuya and Miyuki gave way to the doctor and left the hospital room.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Tatsuya returned to the multi-storied house in Chofu together with Miyuki. Tatsuya “settled in“ in the living room and did not give any signs that he was going to leave any time soon.



	“Tatsuya-sama... Are you sleeping here tonight?” Miyuki asked, putting a cup of coffee before Tatsuya.



	Before Minami started living with them, Tatsuya's coffee was only served by Miyuki. However, even after Minami came, preparing drinks for Tatsuya remained the responsibility of Miyuki, but sometimes, when she lost her vigilance, this work fell to Minami.



	In those days, Miyuki considered such incidents as annoying, but now she could not resist the sad loneliness of having no more anxiety, that at any moment her work could be done by the maid. Perhaps Miyuki was not completely selfish.



	“I think I'm leaving the villa in Izu. If circumstances allow it, I will pick up the necessary things from there tomorrow.”



	“So you're coming back here?”



	Miyuki slightly expanded her eyes. These eyes were shining with joy. If Minami had not gone to the hospital, Miyuki would have shown her joy much more openly.



	“I'll come... Yes, right. I'll return.”



	Despite the fact that Tatsuya stayed in this multi-storied house overnight, he did not live here. So he was puzzled whether it was possible to call it “return“. However, Tatsuya’s place is near Miyuki.



	... If Miyuki calls this place her home and lives here, it is the right expression for him to return.

	This was the course of Tatsuya's thoughts while he was answering Miyuki.



	“I understand. I'll prepare your room.”



	“Do not make any special preparations. Miyuki, you need to get some rest too.”



	Tatsuya thought that when it comes to Minami, Miyuki was shocked more than he himself. To overcome this anxiety, you need to move forward, and not to stand still.



	However, it is important to give rest to your body.



	Although she said that she would prepare the room, the home automation will cope with the preparation for a bed. Tatsuya decided that Miyuki should take a break too.



	Miyuki looked like she was not happy with it, but she still obeyed the words of Tatsuya.

	Miyuki sat on the couch opposite to Tatsuya. Sometimes her eyes wandered around in an attempt to calm down, and in the end, her gaze was met with the eyes of Tatsuya.



	“What's wrong? Is there something you want to ask?”



	When Tatsuya ordered Miyuki to tell him what was wrong, she finally spoke.



	“Tatsuya-sama... What are you going to do about Minami-chan?”



	“What do you mean with “What are you going to do“? I'm not going to force her to do anything against her will.”



	“I-I beg your pardon. That's not what I meant!”



	When a frowning Tatsuya questioned her, Miyuki in a panic waved her hands.



	“Is it...? Maybe you wanted to ask, what duties I wanted to give Minami?”



	“Yes... No, that too, of course, but...”



	It seemed that Miyuki decided to say something difficult. And Tatsuya finally realized what Miyuki wanted to ask.



	“—... Minami will no longer be able to do everything she wants.”



	Tatsuya could not force himself to express it in clear words. Probably because the current situation was unknown to him.



	“It means... That Minami’s responsibilities will no longer include the work of a guardian?”



	“Right.”



	As soon as Tatsuya said this, his hesitation was gone.



	“She won't be able to use magic until the damage to her Magic Calculation Area is cured. Besides, we don't know if we can cure it at all. For us magicians, the Magic Calculation Area is like a black box. There are still too many unrevealed mysteries in terms of both its structure and nature.



	“Really... Although the Head of the Ichijou family seems to have recovered, it does not necessarily mean that Minami-chan will recover as well...”



	“— Another Head of a family of the Ten Master Clans, the previous head of the Juumonji family lost his ability to use magic because he frequently, intentionally overloaded his Magic Calculation Area. He cannot say anything optimistic about his treatment.”



	Both Tatsuya and Miyuki’s faces were concerned and gloomy.



	“—... In addition, even if it is restored now, it will not necessarily be the same again.”



	“Only if she continues to use magic?”



	“Right. In addition, next time it could be that first aid is not provided on time.”



	Miyuki’s face became even sadder.



	“That means... That Minami-chan could no longer work as a magician?”



	“No, she can continue to work as a regular magician.”



	“But you mean that... She won't be able to withstand an intense battle?”



	“That's right, Miyuki. First of all, the duty of a guardian, who is not allowed to retreat, will be impossible. It would be better to avoid participating in battles.”



	“Will Minami-chan agree to this?”



	“Life is not just about battles. I believe that Minami will want to go on a path that leads to a peaceful life.”



	Miyuki’s gloomy face brightened up a little. However, there was no relief on her face.



	“And Onii-sama... No nothing. Sorry.”



	You want to try to persuade Minami to live a peaceful life, but what about you, Tatsuya? Does Tatsuya not have the right to live in peace? Trying to ask this, Miyuki stopped, and did not finish her sentence. Miyuki realized that this is a meaningless question in reality. Realizing this, she gave up on the idea halfway.



	Even if Tatsuya wanted a quiet life, his surrounding environment would not allow it. Even if Tatsuya himself is not going to use his Strategic Class Magic, its presence alone does not allow him to have any enemies or friends. And this is not an assumption, but a fair and obvious fact.



	“Okay.”



	Tatsuya, of course, understood this. Perhaps he understood it much deeper than Miyuki.

	Realizing what she wanted to ask, Tatsuya could only answer with that.





	Chapter 3



	Monday, June 10th.



	Everyday life ruthlessly continued, regardless of such extraordinary events as yesterday's attack that was used from across the sea.



	Although Miyuki could not stop worrying about Minami, she, as usual, went to First High.



	“Is Tatsuya not busy with all kinds of things...?” Minami apologetically asked Tatsuya. She, was squatting and laying in a hospital bed in a bent state. She has not yet been able to move her body, so her upper half was clad in a supportive exoskeleton (A trusted medical device to aid her strength).



	“I am exempted from classes. So you don't have to worry about me.”



	“But...”



	“Wouldn’t it be better if you lied down and rested a little?”



	No matter how much she said it, Minami’s “Don't worry“ was not convincing. To stop any other useless questions, Tatsuya forcibly changed the subject. Apart from the goal of sending the conversation in the other direction, he was also bothered by Minami’s exoskeleton.



	No. The doctor advised that if you use this support, and not just lie down, you can quickly return to everyday life.



	“But it's not a very comfortable thing to look at.”



	Tatsuya was familiar with this kind of strength aid because of his mobile suit. This system had a high rate of feedback, so he knew that it did not complicate movement. Of course, there could be differences in performance with the latest military equipment, but at least no stiffness could be felt in your movements.



	Since the weight of the exoskeleton is maintained by contact with the surface of the floor or earth, the person wearing it should not feel this weight.



	However, it is tightly attached to the body, so a certain sense of pressure could not be avoided.

	So it is not absolutely inconvenient.



	Tatsuya speculated so, but...



	“It's all right. My skin’s sensitivity is not completely back, so for the most part I do not feel that I am wearing it.”



	... He unwittingly rounded his eyes after hearing the unexpected response from Minami.

	“Are you paralysed...?” with a quiet voice Tatsuya asked, quickly recovering from his surprise.

	But this tone of voice was chosen unconsciously.



	“To call this being paralyzed is an exaggeration... It just feels a bit intrusive.”



	With the serious voice of Tatsuya, Minami did not know what to say as if she was under psychological pressure. But she clearly didn't mind the anxiety about the anomalies in her own body.



	“What did the doctor say?”



	“I was told that neither the brain nor the nervous system is damaged, so it is a temporary anomaly due to exhaustion.”



	“If that is it, it’s good.”



	Although he said that, a disturbed look could still be seen on his face.



	“Tatsuya-sama... Can I ask one question?”



	Looking back at it, Minami was not be able to understand why she asked this question.



	“Ask away.”



	However, at that moment she, for some reason, could not keep her doubts to herself.



	“Why is Tatsuya-sama so worried about me?”



	First, Tatsuya slightly frowned his eyebrows, not understanding the meaning behind the question. But his face quickly changed to an “Understanding“ one, and a reproaching bitter smile also came with it.



	“— Yes, it must seem strange that I, who lacks emotions, could care about strangers.”



	“N-no, that's not what I meant!”



	Minami hurriedly tried to correct Tatsuya’s mistake.



	“It's okay. You got it right.”



	Even though he said so, Minami realized what kind of impression he was hiding behind this question. Minami felt ashamed of her impoliteness. So much so that apologizing won't help her any more.



	“What is wrong with your assumption, is that you thought I was a stranger to you.”



	Minami unwittingly burst out a bewildered “uh...?“. Such a reaction could also be considered to be rude. However, Tatsuya did not take it as rudeness.



	“Minami, how much do you know about me?” Tatsuya followed with a question of his own.



	But Minami could not answer this question. Tatsuya understood that. So he gave the correct answer to this question.



	“Except for any cases related to Miyuki, I cannot have real emotions. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that I cannot have strong emotions.”



	This was known to Minami. That's why she didn't say anything. It was too important a secret that strangers could not know.



	“But Miyuki thinks of you as a sister. Minami, you're family for Miyuki. And I also understand that a girl named Sakurai Minami is deeply associated with Miyuki-san. I'm worried about you, because Miyuki worries about you from the bottom of her heart. Maybe it'll sound rude to you, but through Miyuki, I'm really worried about you.”



	“... I am very grateful, this is an honour for me.”



	Miyuki thinks of her as a sister. Minami was “grateful.“



	Tatsuya worries about her through his affection for Miyuki. This was an honour for Minami. Minami understood that, as Tatsuya-sama said, any emotions accompanying his attachment to Miyuki were real.



	“I didn’t know the meaning behind it, but...”



	It seems that Tatsuya was not be able to understand what kind of mental processes could have led to such words by Minami.



	“— ..I beg your pardon.”



	“Don't pay attention to it.”



	Minami could not explain her thoughts. She preferred to withdraw her answer rather than to respond against her will.



	“—... In the evening, I will come again together with Miyuki. So, forget about your duty and just focus on healing.”



	Tatsuya did not particularly care about getting an answer.



	“Yes. I'll follow your advice.”



	Minami bowed to Tatsuya with a barely noticeable faint movement of her head.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Frankly speaking, Miyuki wanted to miss school today.



	She was not sure how she would be able to concentrate on her studies with what Minami was going through. Instead, she wanted to be near Minami.



	However, she could not help her treatment, even if she was there. On the contrary, she was not allowed to come. She was told that by staying near her for a long period of time, she could unconscious emit Psion waves that could awaken Minami’s Magic Calculation Area, which would prevent her treatment.



	She did not intend to emit Psion waves on accident. This could have happened up to before the day that the Pledge, which halved her power, was broken. But her present self, had the ability to control her magic, and she would not recklessly exert any pressure on other magicians.



	However, she could not disagree that in comparison with Tatsuya’s ability to completely control his Psion, her control was still weak. Miyuki realized that her Psion count did not reach the level of Tatsuya, but she still had a much higher amount than the average magicians, so she could not deny the possibility of negatively impacting Minami’s health.



	For this reason, Miyuki abandoned the side of Minami and, as usual, went to school.



	As soon as she entered the classroom, Honoka and Shizuku came to her with anxious faces.



	“Miyuki, are you all right?”



	“What are you talking about?”



	She didn't pretend to not understand. Because just the sudden question “Are you okay?“, was not clear enough for her to respond with anything but with the question “What is it about?“. If it was a question about something else, it could be a mistake to reveal information that should be kept secret.



	In this particular case, however, such vigilance was futile.



	“The place mentioned in yesterday's statement of the government, this is the villa where Tatsuya-sama stays at!? Miyuki, you said you were going there last night!”



	It turns out that both Honoka and Shizuku realized that the target of the Magic was Tatsuya.



	“Yes. ... Tatsuya and I are fine, but Minami-chan had to go to the hospital.” Miyuki said and sat down in her place.



	“Huh!?”



	“— ... Is she hurt?”



	Honoka froze in shock, and Shizuku asked, sitting at her seat, with her back turned around.

	Shizuku’s seat was right in front of Miyuki’s.



	“It's not a wound, but... Something like that.”



	Miyuki gave a vague answer to the question of Shizuku. The overheating of the Magic Calculation Area is only found in magicians, but it still does not apply to normal illnesses or injuries. Although the body and mind are different things, there is no difference between them in the notion of “something similar to a wound“, so her words could not be called a lie.



	“I see... How bad is it?”



	Shizuku did not interrogate her about Minami’s condition. She just asked if it was a serious injury or a light one.



	“It is not yet known how long she will be in the hospital...”



	The face of Miyuki looked worried.



	“Understood... I'm worried about her.”



	Worry was also on the faces of Honoka and Shizuku.



	“Can we come and see her?”



	“It's not an infectious disease, so I guess it won't be a problem. I'll have to ask her doctor.”



	Miyuki did not immediately responded to the request of Shizuku. Miyuki was glad that they wanted to visit Minami, but, given the circumstances, she could not give consent herself.



	“Okay.”



	“Please tell me when you get her doctor's permission.”



	“Of course.” With a slight smile Miyuki nodded to Honoka, crouching at the edge of her desk.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	“Who's there?” Minami asked, having heard a knock on the door of the room dedicated to her.



	It's about 11 o’clock now. Tatsuya should be in Izu and Miyuki at school.



	This hospital was under the control of the Yotsuba family, but it was not exclusively used for the Yotsuba family. As a polyclinic, it could also take on regular patients. However, Minami has heard that in the block where her room is located, people are only allowed to pass after a strict check.



	Minami believed that the likelihood of any suspicious people appearing to be very low. So she thought that someone associated with the Yotsuba came to see how she was, but she was wrong.



	“It's Kudou Minoru.”



	The answer that came from behind the door was completely unexpected to Minami.



	“Mi-Minoru!!“



	The only thing Minami could do was give this little sensible phrase to maintain the dialogue, but in her mind she was shouting “What!“.



	But this exclamation was not because of meaningful questions such as “How does Minoru know that I was in the hospital“ or “How did Minoru learn about this hospital“, but because her consciousness was clouded from embarrassment.



	However, she was only confused for a moment. Her upbringing, corresponding to a girl of her age, reminded her in what position she was now.



	In the morning, before Tatsuya came, she managed to clean herself up. However, from that moment on she has been lying down in a half-asleep state, and her hair was certainly a mess. In addition, she could not meet Minoru in such a grubby posture...



	“Please wait a bit!”



	Minami’s reaction was fast, but her right hand moved slowly. With this hand, she pressed the big button on the wired control bed.



	The bed bent, lifting the upper half of Minami’s body.



	Supported by the auxiliary exoskeleton, Minami slightly pushed her back away from the bed. This was done so there was a small gap between the bed and Minami’s back. Using this gap, she disconnected the right and left half of her exoskeleton.



	The auxiliary exoskeleton was worn only on Minami’s upper half of the body, supporting it.



	Using a part of the exoskeleton, she could help the movements of her hands. Minami took a mirror and comb and hurriedly removed the mess in her hair, while looking in the mirror.



	In fact, she also wanted to do her make-up, but in the hospital room, there was a limit to what she could do to change her look.



	“— ... Sorry for making you wait. Please come in.”



	The AI in the room analysed Minami’s voice and opened the door lock.



	“Sorry for the intrusion...”



	Answering with an indecisive voice, Minoru entered the chamber.



	At that moment the room was filled with a sacred light.



	It was as if the room was filled with a pure white light that came down from the skies.



	... Of course, this spectacle only unfolded in the imagination of Minami.



	“Sakurai-san, um... How are you feeling?” Minoru asked with a shy smile, not noticing the strange look directed at him by Minami. Or maybe, at the moment, he didn’t care about such trifling matters.



	With the help of Minoru, the usual conversation began, and Minami was able to escape from the world of fantasies back to reality.



	When her mind returned to the realization of what was happening, the previously foggy questions finally began to surface.



	... How does Minoru know I was in the hospital?



	... How did Minoru determine that I was being treated in this hospital?



	But instead she did not ask Minoru about this.



	“Yes. I don't feel any discomfort, like pain or suffering. The doctor said that even though the body’s strength has not returned, I will soon be better.”



	Minami responded humbly to his question.



	“That's good.”



	Minoru smiled widely. Minami’s pale cheeks reddened.



	If the smile of Minoru had lasted a little longer, Minami would've lost consciousness for a reason different than fatigue.



	Minoru looked at Minami with serious eyes.





	Minami did not even realize that her consciousness was gradually fading away. Even such trivial questions as “Why are you not at school“ flew out of her head the moment when she heard his voice outside the door.



	“— ... Sakurai-san. Besides that, is there anything wrong with you?”



	“Other than what?”



	He had asked her just like a doctor. Minami felt this suspicion from his words.



	“— for example, is your sight blurry or can you hear everything correctly?”



	“— ......”



	She really only had the symptom of a weakened touch. But is it possible to talk about

	this to Minoru? That's not a simple concern, is it? ... For this reason, Minami was hesitant to respond.



	“There is no need to answer someone like me. Of course if you think that. But this is an important matter. Sakurai-san, I want you to answer me honestly!”





However, she was not able to hesitate with the serious gaze of Minoru upon her.



	“— ... My sense of touch is a bit...”



	“Your touch has weakened!?”



	The face of Minoru approached the face of Minami. Minami, who was unable to withstand it, looked away. At that moment, she had the strong feeling that “I can't keep looking at his face“, and not that “I can't stand the shame“. Needless to say, the fact that she could turn her face away from hostility, did not mean she could also do this with her speech.



	“Yes, it has. ... Now, Minoru. As I said earlier, please call me Minami.”



	Due to the unexpected request, Minoru’s attention slightly deviated from Minami’s condition. Because of this, Minoru noticed the dubious position that he now occupies, and quickly withdrew himself. Realizing that this is what Minami wanted, he moved to an appropriate distance.



	“— Uh, but...”



	Minoru was an incomparably handsome young guy, but his experience in dealing with the opposite sex was zero. His mysterious beauty forced girls to retreat, and not approach him.



	Although the cause for this was not because he is an “unpopular man“, but for Minoru, being one of the “popular guys“, it was still a bit difficult to “call a pretty girl by her name“. When it was such a beautiful girl as Miyuki, this feeling of resistance was denied by himself, but for a high school student... No, for Minoru, Minami was a “pretty cute girl“, and he felt a bit embarrassed.



	“Otherwise I will have no choice but to call you “Kudou-sama“...”



	Minami and Minoru exchanged looks, which made her face become even redder.



	Given the status of Minami and Minoru, she, from the very beginning, had to say Kudou.



	But Minami began to call Minoru “Minoru-sama“, when he had agreed to call Tatsuya and Miyuki by their name, because it was difficult to distinguish between them, since both of them are called “Shiba-san“. Therefore “Kudou-sama“ was the right option to use when Tatsuya and Miyuki weren’t present.



	Minami might have understood this. But despite her understanding, she seemed to want to continue calling him “Minoru-sama“.



	“I understand, Minami-san.”



	Having seen the expression on Minami’s face, Minoru forgot about his embarrassment. And after hearing her words, he answered reflexively. It seemed that Minoru also wanted her to continue to calling him by his name.



	“Yes, Minoru.”



	“— ......”



	“— ......”



	But their feeling of embarrassment had not disappeared. And this time it was not just Minoru. The feelings of shame of one of them enhanced that feeling of the other, and the chamber was filled with an atmosphere of real youth.



	“— ... Uh... Did the doctor say anything about your sense of touch?”



	“Oh, yes, he did... I was told that since neither the brain nor the nervous system is damaged, it is a temporary anomaly...”



	Minoru’s face became gloomy when he heard the answer of Minami. When Minami saw a change in Minoru’s face, her anxiety began to grow. Although she behaved as if nothing had happened, she was actually frightened by the anomalies in her body.



	The Yotsuba family told her about the instability of modified magicians. She knew that someday this fate would overtake her.



	... It's possible that “someday“ has already come.



	It was a lie if you said that Minami was not thinking about this.



	If it was just the natural deterioration of the body, it wouldn't really bother her.However, it was obvious that this is not the usual anomaly of the five senses. Minami knew this was caused by overloading the Magic Calculation Area. And she knew that the sudden death of modified people was also related to the excessive use of magic.

	She gave all her strength to protect Miyuki. And she didn't regret it. At that moment, she was not pretending, but she was really ready to give up her life, and even now she does not regret it.



	But she was too afraid to think about death. So she tried not to think about it. She lied to herself and pretended to be cold-blooded about it.



	However, now that Minami saw the serious face of Minoru, that alarm started to ring again.



	“Minami-san, uh, can I touch your hand...?”



	“— ... Yes please?”



	If this was some other time, Minami would not have responded so quietly. The anxiety spread in her mind and weakened her embarrassment.



	Using the help of exoskeleton, Minami stretched her right hand to Minoru. The other side looked embarrassed. Despite the fact that it was his request, his white cheeks blushed slightly. Minoru carefully put his right palm under the stretched right palm of Minami. And he put his left hand on the back of her hand.



	As expected, Minami was immediately flushed because of these actions.



	Minoru slowly moved his left hand. His cheeks were still red, but his eyes were serious.



	These intense eyes of Minoru were chained to Minami.



	Minoru frowned his eyebrows several times, as if feeling that something that both the doctor and Minami did not know.



	After about a minute, Minoru let go of Minami’s hand, took a deep breath and exhaled.

	Perhaps he was so concentrated that he forgot to breathe.



	Minami quietly gasped at the same time, but this reaction was a show of tension, not relief.

	Minoru did not notice this action of Minami.



	“— ... Minami-san. This may sound cruel, but Minami-san's wound hasn't healed yet. The Magic Calculation Area is still damaged. Even if the physical condition is restored, it is still unknown if you can lose consciousness again.”



	“— ... So that's how it is.”



	“I know it's hard to believe.”



	But Minami believed in the words of Minoru. On the contrary, she believed in herself. Minami thought this, when she realized that she knew the truth all along.



	“However, I would like you to believe in me.”



	Minami mentally, and not out loud, made a surprised “Uh?“ sound.



	What does he want her to believe...? These words from Minoru were unexpected to Minami.



	But her doubts were immediately answered.



	“I will definitely find to treat you. That's why I don't want you to give up.”



	The question that now surfaced in Minami’s head was “why?“. This morning, Minami asked the same question to Tatsuya. But she could not decide whether or not she wanted to ask Minoru this question as well.



	“— ... Okay. I will rely on you, Minoru.”



	The answer she gave was unexpected, both for Minoru and for her.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	When Tatsuya, who was preparing to move away from the villa in Izu, was interrupted during lunch, it was already 1 PM. He did not have to do things like packing and loading, but he could not entrust the transfer of important research data to other people.



	The kitchen and all the kitchen utensils were originally part of the villa, so Pixie, as usual, prepared lunch. Not only the kitchen utensils, but most of the equipment and clothing in this villa was organized by the main house of the Yotsuba, so there wasn’t much luggage involved in the transfer to the multi-storied house in Chofu. Lunch was a bit late because he first decided to completely finish all his business.



	At the table in the dining room, it was just Tatsuya. Other workers went to the truck to eat there with the lunches they brought with them in boxes. Tatsuya could understand their feelings, because they tried to avoid sitting with an “important person“, so he did not force them to join his table.



	“Tatsuya, I'm sorry to interrupt your meal.”



	When Tatsuya had already finished doing all the dishes and rested with an afternoon coffee, Hanabishi Hyougo entered. Today he was not in his usual three-piece suit, but in his working trousers and jacket, similar to the uniform of a courier to a company. Because of his young age, this appearance suited him well. But in the current situation, the phrase “suited well“ meant “not feeling uncomfortable“, and not “fashionable looks“.



	Therefore, when he, as usual, politely bowed, his appearance did not arouse a sense of irrelevance.



	“No, I've already finished eating. What’s wrong?”



	“I received a report from a person responsible for the Chofu Aoba Medical Clinic.”



	[Here, Aoba is not written like the name of Toudou Aoba, but knowing the author, this is clearly not a coincidence.]



	The Chofu Aoba Medical Centre, the name of the hospital, is where Minami resided. Tatsuya felt anxious for a moment that the condition of Minami had worsened, but he quickly gave up on this thought. If that were so, the tone of Hyougo's voice would be more intense. In this respect, Hyougo definitely was a man who could be anxious.



	“I'm listening.”



	“At about 11 o'clock, someone visited Sakurai in her room.”



	For Hyougo, Minami was one of the maids serving the Yotsuba family. As a butler, he had a higher status. So it was normal for him to call her that.



	“Have you visited her? But I thought the amount of people allowed to visit were limited?” Tatsuya asked these questions.



	“The hospital staff understands that. However, they could not just mindlessly throw this person out. They had filed a request to the main house, and from there on, he was given permission.”



	“Who was it?“



	According to the words that he could not be thrown out, it was clear that it was not an ordinary visitor. Besides, he says that the man was given permission from the main house. Tatsuya had no idea who this visitor could be.



	“The third son of the Kudou family, Kudou Minoru-sama.”



	Minoru was the youngest child of his five brothers and sisters. By seniority, he was the fifth to be born: First his sister, second his brother, afterwards his sister, then his other brother, and finally, he himself.



	“Minoru...?”



	The first thing that surfaced in Tatsuya’s head was the natural question, why did Minoru come on a weekday.



	He didn't need to think very hard to understand how Minoru knew that Minami was in the hospital.



	Fujibayashi told him.... Tatsuya quickly came to this conclusion. In fact, this information had to

	remain within the army, but Fujibayashi to some extent was sympathetic towards Minoru. If Minoru had begged, something could have definitely been leaked. Moreover, for the Self-Defense Forces, this information does not need to be kept strictly confidential.



	But having learned even this, Tatsuya could not understand the reason why he came to visit, skipping school today, as if in a hurry. Minoru spent less than three days with Minami in total. In fact, it looked like they had good compatibility, but he didn't notice that they really became friends.



	In Kyoto, Minami cared for a sick Minoru, so the likelihood that he might have certain feelings, is not equal to zero. But even with that in mind, his vigour in this matter is too high.



	Tatsuya did not know Minoru’s character well enough to say that it is not like the usual Minoru.



	However, Tatsuya felt that the passionate desire to leave his bed in Tokyo and skip school, is not very consistent with the image he has of Minoru.



	“By the way, is Minoru still at the hospital?”



	If he is still in the Chofu Aoba Medical Centre, Tatsuya wanted to ask him directly what his intentions were.



	“No, he's already gone. Looks like he spent about 20 minutes in the hospital room.”



	However, in fact, this did not go as Tatsuya thought.



	Tatsuya thought that Minoru had spent too little time there. Still, Tatsuya could not decide if 20 minutes was too much or too little compared to the average time for visiting a patient. However, if you consider this passionate desire to visit a patient in the hospital, even skipping school, it could be concluded that he simply overdid himself.



	It wasn't just a visit, right? Did he have any other purpose?



	There was too little data to infer the true intentions of Minoru.



	“I'm fine with Minoru. Anything else?”



	“Nothing else.”



	With Tatsuya’s gesture, he in deferentially dismissed the bowing Hyougo.



	When they were alone, Tatsuya turned to Pixie, sitting in a corner of the dining room motionless, like a decoration.



	“Pixie, get my information terminal.”



	“Yes.”



	Not answering telepathically, but through the built-in mechanical speaker, Pixie quickly brought his terminal.



	Last autumn, Tatsuya exchanged contact information with Minoru. After the case having to do with Zhou Gongjin, they never contacted each other, but if Minoru did not change his ID, he could be contacted.



	However, Tatsuya’s expectations were not justified. Since the speaker heard the sound of someone being called, it means that the ID was not invalid. The link identifier (ID) attached to a particular information terminal cannot be re-used, so if you change the ID, the old ID becomes invalid. In other words, instead of the sound of a call, an invalid ID message will be issued.



	In case the terminal is turned off, the corresponding message will be voiced. In other words, either Minoru cannot take the phone now, or pretends that he is not around.



	“... But pretending to not be there is not like him. “



	In the absence of data, there was only speculation. Tatsuya decided to temporarily postpone his suspicions for Minoru’s actions.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	When Tatsuya called Minoru, he was already driving to Nara with a long-distance train, a so-called “trailer“.



	But this wasn't the reason why he didn't answer the phone.



	A trailer is a subspecies of a road train carrying individual cabins. Passengers can enter



	the cabins of the trailers and are not forced to sit with bent legs and hands in a cramped space.



	Minoru did this.



	A private cabin is like a closed room. If you call while you're in there, you're not going to hurt anyone.



	Then why didn't Minoru answer his phone? Because Minoru just didn't notice the sound of the ringtone.



	At this point, Minoru was having a mental conversation in his head.



	It was not a technique of thinking in the form of having a conversation with himself. He was not able to hear any sound, when concentrating on the conversation he was having with his “knowledge“, which once was the former ghost of Zhou Gongjin.



	Minoru asked about a treatment method for Minami. The answer his “knowledge“ gave, was cruel.



	“It will be difficult to restore her Magic Calculation Area.“



	“That is, it cannot be cured? Why? After all, the Head of the Ichijou family successfully recovered, didn’t he?”



	Despite the fact that the cause of Ichijou Gouki’s disease was supposed to be hidden, but among the Ten Master Clans, they all understood that it was the overheating of the Magic Calculation Area.

	There was an announcement from the Ichijou family that the recovery was successful, and the Kudou family concluded that this information was true.



	“The damage received by Ichijou Gouki did not seem to be that serious.”



	“You mean that the damage inflicted to Minami-san is more serious!?”



	“I believe that she will be physically restored. The doctor didn't lie about that.”



	“Physically?”



	“If she rests for some time, the weakening of her physical body and the partial failure of her sense of touch should return to its original state in a relatively short time.”



	Minoru became a little calmer when he heard this. However, his anxiety quickly returned.



	“However, the cause of the injury to the physical body is the damage done in the Magic Calculation Area? If you don't deal with this cause, then it can happen again?”



	“The probability that it will repeat naturally is rather small. Unlike “me“, she does not have to constantly support the excessive activity of Psions at a level that a physical body cannot withstand.”



	The harsh answer given by his “knowledge” only started to get on Minoru’s nerves. Usually a high activity of Psions is an indicator of an outstanding magician. But in the case of Minoru, these were shackles, binding him to his bed.



	Minoru kept his wrath of despair in his mind. Now the priority should be a way to cure Minami.



	It was not the time to discuss his own disadvantages, which nothing can be done about.



	“Does it mean that the illness of the physical body will continue to happen if Psion activity increases?”



	When you use magic, Psion activity occurs inside a magician. The stronger the magic, the more intense this activity. If the increased Psion activity will harm the physical body, it means that Minami could faint from the use of High level magic. Advanced magic would become practically useless to her now,



	“That’s true. Compared to “me“, its conditions are clearly visible, so it will not interfere with her daily life. However, as well as “me“, her activity as a magician will be limited.”



	Minoru unwittingly squeezed his teeth. He could not lead magicians in their current struggles. It was the one thing that constantly tormented Minoru. So this was absolutely unbearable.



	“But what about Minami? Will she have to accept the misery of not being able to use magic?”





	“... Will she be able to live normally without using magic?”



	“Unfortunately, I cannot give a definite answer. She inherited the body of a modified person. Perhaps even both her parents came from modified descent. Even if she does not try to use magic herself, there may be a situation that her Magic Calculation Area will go out of control and exceed the permissible limits of her body.”



	“Just like “mine”?”



	“If this is the case, her situation is more serious than “mine“. “My“ spirit is not strong enough, but it has a high regenerative ability. Therefore, even with frequent illnesses, it ends up not being fatal. However, in her case, the damage to her spirit can lead to the total exhaustion of her life.”



	“... But she was saved this time.”



	“Someone had restored her spirit on the spot.”



	Minoru’s intuition told him that it was Tatsuya.



	Minoru did not know about all the magical abilities that Tatsuya possessed.



	But he watched the Monolith Code Rookie Division on TV 2 years ago.



	In that match, Tatsuya couldn’t dismiss Ichijou Masaki’s attack, strong enough to inflict a deadly trauma, but he miraculously recovered and caused an unexpected turn during the battle.



	Based on that situation, Tatsuya must have an advanced self-healing ability. He can probably use it on other people.



	“Then what will happen if she “faints” when that “someone” is not there to help her...?”



	“She won't be saved. This is the fate that people with modified bodies follow. I assume that in the case of “Minami-san“ this could also happen the next time.“



	“So the method to cure her is the same as mine...?”



	“Merging with a parasite. This seems to be the most effective.”



	Minoru completed the dialogue with his “knowledge“.



	To save Minami, he must infect her with a “parasite“. Minoru thought that this was unthinkable. But he was in the same situation. Thinking about it, Minoru began to think that there was something attractive about that.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	As Tatsuya promised, in the evening he and Miyuki came to visit Minami. During their conversation, Minami told them about Minoru’s visit.



	“So Minoru said that he'd find a way to treat you?”



	“Yes, Tatsuya-sama.”



	As he thought, it was not just a simple visit. Hearing the response of Minami, Tatsuya nodded slightly.



	Although Tatsuya doubted the intentions of Minoru, hearing about them holding hands and him stroking the back of her hand, in the end he became convinced that the real intention of Minoru was to cure Minami.



	“Onii-sama, does Minoru-kun have such knowledge?”



	Miyuki, who listened to Minami’s story with him, asked an interesting question. The treatment of the Magic Calculation Area is a complex issue that the Yotsuba family has been exploring for many years and has not yet achieved its goal.



	“I can't say that he doesn’t have it. As was possibly seen at last year’s Thesis Competition, that Minoru’s understanding of “Reason“ far surpasses the level of a student. In addition, the magic of the former ninth laboratory, which has elements of Ancient Magic, also uses spells related to the system of Mental Interference Magic. It is probable that Minoru could find the key to the treatment of the Magic Calculation Area in the studies of the former Ninth laboratory.



	“However, Yotsuba researchers have not ceased to study the Magic Calculation Area since the former fourth laboratory. But despite this, the method of treatment has not yet been found. In addition, Minoru-kun has an imbalance between his Magic Calculation Area and his physical body. If he had such knowledge, wouldn't he start with treating himself?”



	“He could learn more about it because he has a similar problem.”



	Tatsuya shook his head and rejected Miyuki’s objection.



	“There is no point in discussing the abilities of Minoru here and now. He said he'd find a way to treat Minami. Let us perceive the good intentions of Minoru precisely as good intentions.”



	“— ... Right. Sorry for such useless doubts.”



	Tatsuya nodded to Miyuki and looked at Minami again.



	“Local doctors are also making a lot of efforts to treat Minami. The main house seems to be sending their research here, and I'm not going to sit around either. Be calm and wait for the good news.” Tatsuya said to calm Minami down.



	“Well. Uhm, Tatsuya...”



	However, Minami responded with an alarming voice as if it “caused the opposite effect“.



	“What is it?”



	He did not, of course, show any signs of anxiety on his part. With a calm face and a calm voice, he asked Minami to continue.



	“Could you please ask Minoru yourself so that he doesn't try to do the impossible?”



	“Really?” Tatsuya mentally muttered. It seems that the anxiety that Minami showed was not about the success of her treatment, but about the same Minoru that they were discussing.



	“Did you feel that there was something wrong with Minoru?”



	“Yes. ... He seemed very tense. He looked... As if he was not just worried about me, but as if he was hiding some other, more serious suffering...”



	“Did Minoru give off such bad feelings?”



	“No. He didn't look overworked or weakened.”



	“— ... I'm worried, Onii-sama.”



	Miyuki looked disturbed at Tatsuya, as if she had been infected by Minami’s anxiety



	“Minoru is a smart guy. I think he won't do anything reckless...”



	Although Tatsuya said so, he himself was not entirely sure of this.



	He did not know Minoru’s character. He could have said that if it was the Minoru he had met last Fall, he wouldn't do anything stupid. However, the behavior of the current Minoru did not correspond to the image he had of Minoru from that time. Therefore Tatsuya felt such uncertainty.

	Chapter 4

	First High and its nearest station were connected by a straight road. Although it does branch out, it can still be said that, the main road is the only one.

	Most of the students go to and from school on this road. The only exceptions are students who live within walking distance of the school.

	Tuesday, June 11th, morning. On the mentioned pedestrian route the noise from conversations of pupils had risen. Because the well-known President of the School Council, Shiba Miyuki, was walking quite closely with one male pupil.

	And this person was as famous as the President of the School Council. And in terms of fame in society, he was far more famous.

	The name of this person is Shiba Tatsuya.

	He had returned after a long absence.

	“Tatsuya-san!”

	From the gate to the courtyard of First High’s main building was a straight road. Right after Tatsuya stepped on this road, his was called out by a voice that was in front of him.

	There was a figure in the opposite direction among the students going to school, and she was not alone.

	“Tatsuya-san, are you coming back to school?”

	The people who knew the circumstances had faces as if they were saying, “There is nothing to be done about it...“ and the ignorant people looked at them with curiosity. Honoka, not paying attention to any of them, ran to Tatsuya.

	“Yes. From now on, please take care of me again.”

	With a crooked smile on his face Tatsuya answered Honoka, trying not to cause concern.

	Tatsuya quietly approached Honoka and looked at her back.

	Shizuku, standing behind Honoka, said hello with a confused face.

	And behind her back, Erika, Leo, Mikihiko and Mizuki stood with joyful faces. Erika, noticing the glance of Tatsuya, slightly waved her hand.

	Tatsuya continued to go towards the school building with Miyuki to his left, and Honoka attached to his right.

	The entrance for the Magic Engineering course was in

	 the second hallway from the main walkway. This was due to the fact that the classrooms for classes A to D and E to H had separate entrances, and the structure of the school building could not be changed any more.

	Separating from Miyuki, Honoka, Shizuku and Mikihiko, Tatsuya went to his classroom together with Erika, Leo and Mizuki.

	It's been a long time since he was in classroom 3E. Although Erika and Leo were in class F, they also went to class E.

	“We finally left the main group”

	Going to his place at the window, Tatsuya gave his impressions, which were not sarcastic, and quite heartless feelings. Erika and the others did not say anything, but only had stretched smiles.

	Mizuki sat down at her seat, located on the side of Tatsuya, and turned to face him.

	“Given your Stellar Furnace project, is it okay for you to be here now?”

	“Well, of course I'm going to be busy. Therefore, it will be difficult to come to school every day.”

	Mizuki's face was a little sad when she heard Tatsuya's answer. However, she quickly hid it behind a smile.

	“Got it. But I'm glad you'll at least come sometimes.”

	After the words of Mizuki, Erika through the window in the corridor nodded.

	“Even if you are only an “escort“ for Miyuki, and you leave immediately after you came, it will still be somewhat normal. In fact, if Tatsuya-kun isn’t here at all, then there is some sense of dissatisfaction.”

	““Escort“ for Miyuki?”

	Tatsuya could not resist to curve his lips into a smile, hearing the words of Erika, completely ignoring the meaning of school attendance.

	But what Erika said was unexpectedly true.

	“By the way Tatsuya, how bad is it for Sakurai?”

	Leo worried about Minami because she was a kohai from his club.

	“The doctor says that her complications should not remain. But it's going to take a little time.”

	“Okay...”

	Leo was worried about Minami’s condition, and Tatsuya was not the only one concerned about her.

	Of course, the very desire for a full recovery was not a lie. But at the same time, Tatsuya was thinking about the question of what to do with the protection of Miyuki.

	Yesterday she went to and from school alone. It is quite rare to meet a person who can harm Miyuki, whether it be a magician or a non-magician. Besides, Tatsuya can protect Miyuki even when he's not around.

	However, there are also problems that can be avoided only by having an assistant close by. Even for the Yotsuba family it will be difficult to send people to the school grounds. No, it may be possible to send a person to the school staff, but it is impossible to quickly prepare a pupil who will always be there. To only be an escort during the trips to and from school, was what Tatsuya was thinking before Erika mentioned it.

	◊ ◊ ◊

	Tatsuya had returned to First High, not because the excitement of Project Dione had calmed down. On the contrary, because of Tatsuya’s countermeasures that he had started last weak, the hype flared up again.

	The fact that the journalists were no longer crowded around First High was a consequence of the shooting incident.

	Since Taurus Silver's identity has already been disclosed, they did not have to risk their lives to gather information.

	Now it seemed that the excitement, which began in the vicinity of Tatsuya, has spread to a global scale. Among the four largest states, the New Soviet Union took the side of Project Dione, and the Indo-Persian Union, though an official statement from the Government had not yet been made, but it clearly demonstrated the position of supporting Tatsuya’s Project ESCAPES.

	The Great Asian Alliance has not yet disclosed its position.

	Among other countries: in Europe, they mainly support Project Dione; Countries from West Asia to South-East Asia support Project ESCAPES; Brazil and Australia, like the Great Asian Alliance, have not disclosed their attitude.

	The fact that both “camps“ do not publicly show a hostile attitude makes the situation quite confusing. The thing is that both projects, Dione and ESCAPES, coincide in terms of peaceful use of magic. And both projects do not bear the principled position that the enemy should be expelled from Earth. Judging by the published materials, the implementation of Project Dione will not make it impossible to move along with Project ESCAPES, and vice versa. There is just one problem: the same magician will not be able to participate in two projects at the same time.

	With the recognition that these two projects can coexist, the unfolded war of propaganda between Tatsuya and Clark moved forward with it leaning to the side of Tatsuya. It was not Tatsuya’s superiority of intellect over Clark, but it was related to the advantage of “Acting Second*“. This war was not a competition with a judge. Whether delays or fraud are involved, in the end, victory is the most important thing.

	[Explanation from the explanatory dictionary for the word used: “Wait and see the enemy's move, before making your move (for example, in Rock-Paper-Scissors, seeing what the opponent will show before you show your answer)“]

	With his debate, Edward Clark hoped to bypass this using political influence.

	◊ ◊ ◊

	At the time when First High had already finished its first lesson, the commander of the 1-0-1 Brigade of the Self-Defense Forces, Lieutenant General Saeki Hiromi visited the office building of the Ministry of Defence. This was also the joint headquarters of the Japanese Navy, but the purpose of today's visit was the Public sector.

	Saeki was back at the base before noon. Going into her office, she called Kazama.

	“— ... Tatsuya, that is, Shiba Tatsuya-san...”

	“No need to correct yourself, Lieutenant Colonel.”

	Interrupting someone else's speech was not like the normal Saeki. She didn't even try to hide her bad mood.

	Kazama was not puzzled, but rather amused, and he was forced to make great efforts to restrain himself from smiling.

	“— ... I beg your pardon. So you were told to persuade Tatsuya to take part in Project Dione?”

	“— The Head of the Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has no authority to give me orders.”

	In the conference hall of the Ministry of Defence, Saeki met with the Head of the Department of Foreign Affairs of North America. As Saeki said, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has no authority to give orders to the Self-Defense forces. Everything that was said in the conference room was in the form of a request. But the words spoken in the presence of the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence, in fact, were coercion, or, in other words, an order.

	The military do not like to violate their command system. And officers have an even stronger feeling towards this sentiment, and Saeki was no exception. Her bad mood was largely explained by this.

	“Was this request voiced to Your Excellency, because Tatsuya is Special Officer Ooguro Ryuuya?”

	“It looks like it.”

	Kazama sighed, not hiding this from Saeki, who had made a dissatisfied face.

	“It seems that the bureaucrats do not seem to know, why Tatsuya was assigned the title of “Special Officer“.”

	“The status of Special Officer Ooguro is in a certain sense outlawed. It's no surprise that office clerks don't know about him.”

	As Saeki said, in the current Self-Defense Forces there was no such title as “Special Officer“. To begin with, if you look from a historical point of view, then calling Tatsuya a “Special Officer“ would be wrong. It would be more appropriate for him to be called a “militia who has been treated as an officer assigned to the regular army under normal conditions, not temporarily.“ Since there was no corresponding term for this concept, he was simply called a “Special Officer“ for convenience.

	Therefore, those who did not know the real situation, based on the original meaning of the concept of an “officer with special duties“, Tatsuya would be perceived as an ordinary soldier.

	“I think that they should know because they are office workers under jurisdiction of the official legal system.”

	Legal problems were solved by the Self-Defense Forces themselves, but this problem was “illegal“. The existing system requires the consent of the bureaucrats, so it would be impossible to justify the negligence of the Ministry of Defense officials by saying that they did not know.

	“You're right about that, Lieutenant Colonel, but now we have other problems.”

	“I beg your pardon. The problem is whether we can persuade Tatsuya and whether or not we should be persuaded. Isn't it?”

	To deviate from the topic of apologizing, Kazama listed two problems.

	“Right.”

	Saeki nodded to him.

	“— First of all, does the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs understand that Tatsuya is the operator of the “Material Burst“?”

	“Based on the feelings of today's conversation, they did not seem to know.”

	“Understood. If that is the case, I can understand why they gave such an absurd order.”

	Tatsuya was the greatest magical military force Japan possessed. No, not only in magic, he is the greatest of all possible forces. The Joker, alone changing the entire World balance, the fifth ace, creating the strongest hand*.

	[Poker terminology. “Hand“ is a combination of 5 cards received in hands.]

	Although the use of such a problem person as a “Joker“ may be prohibited by rules, but in this world its use is not prohibited. And nobody in his right mind wants to part with him. If they know that Tatsuya is the strongest magician in the strategic class, they will not even think of joining Project Dione.

	“Instead, how about registering Tatsuya as the 14th “Apostle“?”

	Saeki’s face showed her surprise. But the silent pause didn’t last long.

	“— ... That's not a bad idea.”

	“Your Excellency?”

	This time Kazama was the one to be surprised. Because he was just joking.

	“If things worsen even more, we may have to consider this option. If it becomes obvious that he is a Strategic Class Magician, officials will stop saying that he should be transferred to USNA.”

	“That is so, but...”

	“Well, it depends on how the situation will develop. We will deal with the problems as they appear.”

	Having said that, Saeki made a tired face.

	“And if you were to ask him now, Lieutenant Colonel Kazama, do you think you could persuade Shiba-kun?”

	“That's impossible.”

	He would not be able to convince Tatsuya to go to America, even if he were to ask. Therefore Kazama immediately replied that any attempts of persuasion are useless.

	“Besides, I can't say that Tatsuya has a good relationship with us right now. And my own mistake, when we were caught by the hidden video footage the other day, only added more suspicion.

	“It was a mistake by my calculations too. In any case, if we try to convince him, then we cannot succeed, and would on the contrary only worsen our relationship with him.”

	“That's what I think.”

	Saeki had no objection to the judgement of Kazama.

	“— Then, do you think, will we be able to gain the favour of Shiba-kun, by rejecting the demand of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

	“-Hmm... Who knows...”

	On the other hand, Kazama did not agree with her idea.

	“Whatever we do, Tatsuya won't take part in Project Dione. I don't think he's going to be particularly grateful. Wouldn't it be a better choice to do nothing at all?”

	“That is true...”

	Saeki looked down at her hands and pondered. Kazama stood motionlessly in front of her table and waited for her to say something.

	“I'll follow your advice.”

	“You mean you're not going to do anything?”

	“Yes. The demand of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not voiced in the proper manner, but done rather unofficially. There will be no problems if I were to neglect it.”

	Kazama decided that Saeki said so, but she probably planned to ignore the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the very beginning. It was normal to ask his opinion whether it was possible to benefit from this case, about deserving the gratitude of Tatsuya. At least that's what Kazama understood.

	“Lieutenant Colonel, thank you for your help, you are dismissed.”

	“Understood. Beg your pardon.”

	Kazama went out of the commander's office.

	At first Kazama thought that it was necessary to tell Tatsuya, but quickly gave up on this idea.

	The intentions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Self-Defense Forces for Tatsuya are irrelevant. This cannot be used as material to restore their relationship.

	Instead it was necessary to ask Tatsuya’s opinion about his registration as the fourteenth “Apostle“, as the conversation about it could become a reality at any moment.

	Tatsuya has already received undesirable fame from being Taurus Silver. At this rate keeping himself a secret will be impossible. But for Kazama, it was obvious that if you ask Tatsuya if he wants to become an officially State recognised Strategic Class Magicians, the answer will be definitely be “no“. Such an idea can worsen his mood if a mistake were to be made.

	... Kazama seriously worried that his relationship with Tatsuya became so alienated that he had to think of such things.

	◊ ◊ ◊

	And not only the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was swept between Tatsuya and Edward Clark.

	The Ministry of Industry suffered from pressure from the office of the leader of the ruling party, a part-minister. Once, the Ministry of Industry was called the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, but although the name had changed, foreign trade was still under their jurisdiction. The USNA was one of their most important trading partners in this era, so the bureaucrats from the Ministry of Industry wanted to make the differences in trade as little as possible. For them, the quarrel of a single civilian with the USNA was not a joke, and they seriously wanted Tatsuya to go to America as soon as possible.

	However, this morning a request was made by the Office of the Minister who inquired after the legislative measures necessary to implement the “Magic Stellar Furnace Energy Plant Project“. In other words, it meant that they would have to consider another way so that he could not participate in the USNA’s Project Dione.

	Since neither Project Dione nor the project of the plant with a Stellar Furnace reactor were governmental municipal enterprises, Japan itself did not have to care about whether they should join them or not. Even in the New Soviet Union, which showed itself to be the most collaborative, the statement of cooperation wasn’t made by the government, but by the academy. At this stage, if the government does nothing, the USNA will not be able to accuse them of anything.

	On the other hand, the project of the plant is an internal affair of Japan, so it can be said that the role of the Ministry of Industry is to consider its legal aspects. But the request from the Office of the Minister was exerting pressure, because it demanded them to “support the project“, not paying any attention to the circumstances.

	Wondering about why this happened, the Ministry of Industry conducted an investigation. The Office of the Ministers sent inquiries to many groups of companies, which are a great source of funds for the ruling party.

	There were a lot of businessmen who opposed the project, which is likely to worsen their relations with USNA. Therefore, the real concern of the Ministry of Industry was that the project announced by a simple schoolboy could soon divide the business world into two camps.

	 “Since when has he had such connections?”

“How has he persuaded these old men that lead such companies?“ The employees of the Ministry were puzzled about such questions.

	◊ ◊ ◊

	Tatsuya did not leave the classroom until the morning half of the lessons were over. In the third year of training, the number of specialized subjects related to magic increased. But it does not mean that the number of subjects of the general course disappeared. Tatsuya concentrated on general course lectures that he had missed during his absence, studying them at triple speed.

	Unfortunately, the accumulated quantity could not be completed in half a day, but he did not think he could catch up by even working for a whole day. When the lunch break came, he got up to go for a bite.

	“Tatsuya-san, are you going to eat at—”

	“Shiba-kun.”

	The voice of Mizuki who was sitting him was blocked by a boyish voice.

	It was the voice of Tomitsuka.

	“Mizuki, go to the cafeteria first, I'll catch up.” Tatsuya answered to Mizuki, then turning to Tomitsuka.

	“Tomitsuka, do you need something?”

	“— ... I'd like to talk to you about something.”Tomitsuka replied with a little hesitation, making a persistent face.

	“Is this conversation going to take a long time?”

	In contrast to Tomitsuka, Tatsuya did not seem to be very enthusiastic about this.

	“Possibly.”

	“Can we do this after school?”

	But he still showed that he was ready to listen.

	“I would like to do it immediately.”

	“But this is going to be a long conversation?”

	“That is so... But...”

	Tomitsuka couldn't decide what he wanted to say.

	“Why are you acting so high and mighty? Can't you talk to him.”

	At that moment, a hysterical voice intervened in the conversation.

	“Hirakawa-san...?”

	Hirakawa Chiaki gave Tatsuya a burning look. But he did not embarrass Tatsuya, but Tomitsuka.

	“To say such a thing…! When did Tatsuya-san say he wouldn't listen!?”

	Mizuki who remained there although she was told to go to the dining room, retorted the words of Chiaki.

	It could have escalated into a quarrel between schoolgirls in an empty classroom, so Tatsuya stopped it in advance with the phrase “Mizuki, stop“.

	“Mizuki. I'm sorry, but I'm wasting my time talking to Tomitsuka this lunch break,. Please tell the others.”

	“— ... I got it.”

	Mizuki, trying to hide her dissatisfied face, bowed to Tatsuya and withdrew from the class.

	“Tomitsuka, where are we going to talk?”

	“Uh, let's get to the roof.”

	Tatsuya slightly raised his eyebrows, because other students could still hear them on the roof.

	“Alright.”

	But if Tomitsuka was fine with it, then Tatsuya was not going to complain.

	“Hirakawa-san, thank you.”

	Tomitsuka quietly said this to Chiaki, who sat down, while clenching her fist. After that, he quickly chased after Tatsuya.

	 Contrary to Tatsuya’s expectations, the roof was deserted. In Tokyo, the rainy season began last week, and today the sky was also covered by clouds, so looking at it, it could rain at any moment. Therefore, the absence of students wishing to dine on the roof was quite natural.

	There were benches on the roof, but neither Tatsuya nor Tomitsuka sat down. They stood up straight, facing each other.

	“So, what did you want to talk to me about?” Tatsuya began the conversation.”

	“— ... The other day, my mother had a seizure.”

	“— that is the chairman of the Magic Association, Tomitsuka Hisui, I heard about it from Miyuki. I hope she recovers quickly.”

	Indignation appeared on the face of Tomitsuka after hearing what Tatsuya said about the matter.

	“However, this is the problem for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chairman of the Magic Association. Complaining to me is not quite right.”

	Tatsuya noticed the expression on Tomitsuka's face, but was not going to treat him condescendingly.

	“The way you are talking about it is wrong isn’t it?” Tomitsuka angrily spoke in response to the insensible words of Tatsuya.

	“Fighting a girl younger than yourself, is that “Wrong” too?”

	Tomitsuka wavered because of Tatsuya’s remark.

	For the first time since coming here, Tomitsuka noticed that Tatsuya’s eyes were filled with cold anger.

	“So, Tomitsuka. Are you saying that I have to be sacrificed to spare the chairman of the Magic Association from worries?”

	“What do you mean sacrifice!”

	“Don’t you want to drive me to the USNA?”

	“Drive to...?”

	With a bitter voice, Tatsuya exceeded the expectations of Tomitsuka.

	“I... I think that the project will really help magicians...”

	“Tomitsuka. Don't you understand the real purpose behind Project Dione?”
