	I asked: "What was scary?". Akane shook her head and said: "I do not know."

	"I do not know, but this man is terrible." Nii-san, be careful, "Akane said, and went home.



	February 25, 2097 (Monday)

	The school works again from today. The anti-magical movement became more intense. Even with the death of the "arsonist" of terrorism, the fire that was kindled by him will not extinguish itself. During the time the schools did not work, protests and demonstrations spread throughout the country. The faces of classmates, whom I met for the first time in a long time, were much calmer than before. Maybe they are already used to it. As dangerous conditions continue, people get used to it. This is actually a dangerous situation. When the awareness of the crisis decreases, you can lose your vigilance and suffer. Freezing your mind in a state of crisis should be an inevitable action to protect yourself.

	In any case, class 2A showed the former lively. Perhaps other classes too. As for me, I did not have to go home early from school, because the mission was over. Yes, and stay at home unhealthy behavior. I had to stay here for a while, I had to think about what to do after school.

	Today I first got acquainted with the activities of the disciplinary committee. I also belong to the disciplinary committee of Third High. I wanted to see him once before returning to Kanazawa. During the lunch break, in the dining room, I addressed this request to the head of the Yoshida Committee, which I immediately agreed to. After that, the accompanying Chiyoda-san suggested: "Then, how about making a detour with me?". I remembered the story that I heard from Morisaki on the first day of my "transfer" here. About talented sophomores, with whom you need to be on your guard.

	And the first on that list was the "shadow of the head of the disciplinary committee," Shizuku Ushio. Ushio-san looks calm and grown-up lady. In addition to giving out sometimes tsukkomi, penetrating to the depths of the soul, after her, it seems, there are no actions that hurt others. So I also wanted to find out what the trait of Morisaki and the company is so afraid of her.

	At the same time, a warning sounded instinctively in my head. Was my indecision noticed? Yoshida said to Ushio-san: "I will be his guide, therefore I leave my duties today to you."

	Kitiyama-san nodded silently. Was this really the goal, to force Yoshida to say so? If this is the case, then this nickname "the shadow of the head of the disciplinary committee" may be true.

	At that moment I noticed that one of the participants in the dinner was gone. I without any back thoughts, asked: "Did not Chiba-san come today?". Six people, with the exception of Shiba, froze.

	On my question, which should not have been asked, Shiba replied shortly: "Wake for seven days." I completely forgot the fact that the eldest son of the Chiba family died during the investigation of the terrorism case.

	After school, Yoshida showed me the activities of the disciplinary committee. First of all, I was surprised by the level of development of documentation of incident records. Also, the chief of Yoshida personally dealt with the ordering of the reports. I was told that he also prepares materials for meetings himself. According to rumors, a quick letter is a special skill of Yoshida. On the question, is it true, this skill was demonstrated on the spot. He took the fountain pen in his hand, and hieroglyphs began appearing one after another on the prepared large notebook, merging into the wall of the text. I could not read it, but I knew it was a stencil font.

	It's really amazing calligraphy these days. I was too surprised at the moment that I almost lost my composure. I asked how he came to get such a specific skill. After making a slightly detached face, Yoshida responded that this was the result of working on creating countless amulets to summon magic.

	Indeed, he was a user of ancient magic. Is it really so interesting to use amulets for magic these days? During the Tournament of the Nine Schools, I remember that he used a CAD of a strange shape.

	My desire to see Yoshida using his magic in his original style was immediately fulfilled. In one of the halls for practice a fight broke out.

	In First High there are also pupils with an ardent temper. Hearing and seeing this is a big difference.

	Apparently, this was a routine. The warning and order to stop Yoshida was not just an acting game. Even after the words "all calm down," it was already clear. Yoshida did not pull out the amulet for the spell. Instead, he pulled out something like a folding fan from the left sleeve. If you look carefully, it was a collection of metal stripes in the form of a fan, fastened at the base.

	Yoshida pushed one of the sheets out of this fan, and having folded the index and middle fingers together, he touched this leaf. It seemed to me that something was moving in the air. When I felt the cool humidity on my cheek, a thick fog already surrounded the fighting disciples. From the fog there were screams, like "cold" or "freeze". Well, everything is right, now it's February, winter is the same.

	However, this fog also seemed to contain a dense cloud of psions. Inside it, it would be difficult to launch an activation sequence. Although there was not complete interference, like "jamming," but the magic with CAD seemed difficult, if not to use many more psions than usual.

	Yoshida again warned. This time the words were accompanied by a threat in the form of a lightning strike. The fight immediately subsided. No, I could see something very interesting.

	Closer to the end of the detour, I asked why some guys call him by name, and others by last name.

	Showing a slightly restless look, Yoshida politely explained to me the reason.

	Since this is related to Yoshida's personal life, I will not write it down in the diary.

	However, this guy also has good friends, I thought.



	February 26, 2097 (Tuesday)

	Today after school I was shown the work of the school board. She and this guy work together in the school board. I feel a little more confused.

	In the room of the school board there were also Mitsui-san from the same class, that first-year in the maid costume, and the younger sister of Mayumi-san. The first-year maid was Sakurai-san. And Mayumi-san's sister is Izumi-chan.

	Shiba-san, of course, and this guy, too, worked hard. But, what the hell is this for typing? I used only the keyboard, but I could not keep track of my fingers. Is there really any "magic of self-accelerating typing"?

	The work that the school council was doing now was to prepare for graduation ceremonies and subsequent parties. Third High should be occupied by the same. This guy seemed to be in charge of all the routine work, and Shiba-san, Mitsui-san and Izumi-chan discussed party planning.

	Since Shiba-san wanted to know my opinion, I provided information on the planned activities at Third High. I was happy to be useful. At the height of the discussion, I again felt Izumi-chan's appraising look. Or is it my imagination? I do not have to be narcissistic.

	When it was already dark, Kasumi-chan, the other sister of Mayumi-san appeared from the back door of the school boardroom. Earlier, visiting the house of the Saegusa family, I thought about it, but it looks like these two are really identical twins. At first I could not convince myself, because their hair and character were completely different, but now, seeing them in school uniform, their faces were exactly the same.

	Now it seemed to me that Kasumi-chan, too, sometimes looks at me with an appraising look. What's going on, really?

	After that, we met with Yoshida, Saijou, Chinamai-san and Chiba-san and went to the cafe "Eine Brise", where on Sunday we met with Shiba-san. For this company, it looks like this cafe is a permanent place of leisure. I also wanted to tell Chiba-san the words of condolences that I did not have time to say at lunch time. However, in the end, I decided not to talk. Because I felt from Chiba-san the aura "do not touch me." Compared with congratulations, condolences are a hard thing, I thought.



	February 27, 2097 (Wednesday)

	My "translation" will last until next Saturday. The only day off is next Sunday. Is this normal?

	The mission is over. It seems that there is no need for any elimination of the consequences, as my father told me. It would be nice to return to Kanazawa as soon as possible. I do not think that I will regret it if I do so.

	Today during the lunch break, the female part of the company was animatedly discussing where to spend the weekend.

	She said: "Recently it was mostly shopping, but I would like to go to the cinema." A movie about a loving older sister.

	Now on the monitor, where I write a diary, on the left there is a cinema site, and films are shown that will be shown next Sunday. So, what's next? Recently I asked myself. Cannot do anything at all? Will not I regret it? The second time this possibility may not appear. Correctly. There is no reason to hesitate, there's nothing to be done. When they refuse, then you can think about giving up. I touched the monitor and pressed the select button. There was a message that the ticket was loaded into my mailbox.

	After all these words of my father about the engagement, I just cannot go back without any results. But I started it, and I do not want to destroy everything.



	February 28, 2097 (Thursday)

	The last lesson is over for today. This guy, as usual, came to meet Shiba-san. I stopped her , going to the school boardroom. There were many students in the corridor. This guy was next to her . But I did not dare to call her to talk alone. I felt defeated and tried to avoid the look of this guy.

	I displayed a ticket on the mobile terminal and invited to go to the movies together next Sunday. She opened her eyes wide and looked at Shiba with a slightly worried face.

	"Are you asking for a date?" - Shiba dealt a direct blow with the question. I was nervous and answered: "That's right." His answer was: "I cannot let her go with you alone." Well, I understand his position. But the following phrase surprised me. He said he would give his permission if I did not mind taking Sakurai-san to the movies.

	I did not mind, so I certainly invited Shiba-san again. She showed a puzzled look, now she smiled and nodded to me in return.

	With this brilliant smile, I got consent to a date!

	Honestly, I expected this guy to stop Shiba-san. It seems he has a principle that he does not want to limit Shiba-san in any way. But I understood that Shiba-san and I were limited from seeing each other alone. There is no such guy who will leave his bride alone with a guy who clearly wants to take this bride from him. I was surprised that he did not start saying something like "I'll go with you." But he chose Sakurai-san to accompany her .

	I was very glad that everything turned out this way. Although we will not only be together, but it's much better than worrying about the guy next to us on the heels.

	Why did this guy agree to terms that are convenient for me? He really does not mind? Anyway. If he does this, I will go all the way to accept it. Then let him cry!



	March 1, 2097 (Friday)

	March has begun. Another month, and I will be a third year student.

	Today in the lunch break the topic was a further career. I'm going to go to the University of Magic. All the others also hoped to go there.

	I thought that Saijou would go to the National Defense Academy, but he seems to join the police and enter the special task force.

	From the objective point of view, she will be much more confident in entering the university, and she will not be able to do this only if she loses her magic ability in an accident. If we become students of the university, we are there we will go to the same campus for four years. This can be a painful time for me. At the moment, in fact she is the bride of another person.

	But I'm still looking forward to student life with her .



	March 2, 2097 (Saturday)

	Admit it. This morning I could not do anything. Will this really happen tomorrow? I did not know that I was so new to this day. I never thought that I would worry about what to wear tomorrow.

	So, we have tickets. For Sakurai-san, I also bought it. I also think that money is enough for spending. I also installed the navigator. Although I think that this is not necessary, because I made a sure road map to the venue and the cinema. I also set the alarm.

	Done, it's all right. Okay, let's sleep. The main thing - do not oversleep.



	March 3, 2097 (Sunday)

	As if I was afraid of getting a date canceled due to being late, I woke up before the alarm signal. I slept well and my head was clear. Suddenly a good start, right?

	I went to the bathroom, washed thoroughly. Standing by the mirror, he checked his face 10 times, shaving off all the vegetation. The hairdryer made the hair styling. He got dressed in clothes that he had chosen yesterday for 3 hours. And he went to the meeting place.

	I was not so tense even during the Yokohama incident. I arrived at the meeting place 40 minutes before the promised time. Well, is that not normal? The waiting time was not painful. In reflection, in what clothes she comes, the waiting time flew by unnoticed.

	She came three minutes before the appointed time. At that moment, when I saw her , the world changed. For me, undoubtedly, the world was transformed. Everything around became bright and colorful. And in the center of this world was it . Looking at her , I forgot how to breathe.

	From under a long coat of beige underneath, an elegant gray skirt was visible. Legs, hidden by thick pantyhose, were shod in shoes with heels. Scarf and gloves were chosen under a beige coat color. Among the general adult background, fluffy headphones have become a sweet accent.

	While I stood and could not move, she came up to me and asked: "I made you wait?". I could only shake my head on the reflexes from side to side. She giggled a little at it. I think I acted like a child in this situation. But I'm not sorry. Because it amused her . For the sake of her smile, I'll be at least a clown.

	When I bit my nervousness a little, I noticed that Sakurai-san is standing diagonally behind her . She was wearing a short coat, a sweater, narrow jeans trousers, high sneakers and artificial leather gloves, contrasting with Shiba-san, it was a slightly boyish style. Was it like fighting style, or is it my imagination?

	In order not to waste time, we immediately went to the cinema. There was no need to rush, because we had reserved seats. We bought drinks and went into the viewing hall. Naturally, heating worked inside. Sakurai-san and I only unbuttoned our coats, but Shiba-san elegantly removed her own. Under the coat was an elegant gray dress. For some time now I held my breath. While I was looking at her, she smiled and sat in a graceful movement.

	We sat in a row - I, Shiba-san, Sakurai-san.

	The cinema of a hundred years ago was close enough that people would sit shoulder to shoulder with each other. I do not know whether this was true or fiction, but I heard that the lovers used to be cramped and touched each other's hands, imposing them on the handrails between the seats.

	However, in the modern cinema, it is initially impossible to touch the body of a neighboring person. The attached seat is an important demonstration tool that transmits vibration and tilt. Of course, you can turn off the guiding effect to taste, but the structure of the seat that covers the shoulders on both sides does not change. Moreover, the seating arrangement is made to accommodate even very large people.

	So, definitely, there will not be such an accident as contact with shoulders or fingers with Shiba-san. Oh, how I envy the ancient people.

	The film I chose was the most popular hit, the romantic love story. I do not understand films at all, and I just chose the most popular romance category. The film was from a famous Hollywood studio. The action took place in New York in the 1990s. In short, it was a story about a girl from the era when magic was not yet revealed to the public. The girl lived, hiding her strong ability of psychokinesis, and once fell in love, meeting an ordinary mediocre youth.

	Lighting in the hall disappeared, and a semi-cylindrical screen at one hundred and eighty degrees showed the picture. At 30 degrees from the left and right on this screen was reserved for the effects complementing the picture, so that looking straight ahead, lateral vision caught deepened thrilling sensations. I have not been to the cinema for a long time and was delighted with the spectacle.

	Before watching, I did not turn off the chair functions, thinking that this would be a normal film, but the beginning of the film gave a clear answer why it was a hit all over the world. Not relying on bright special effects, but carefully painting the sensations with a deep 3D image, the film made the audience feel compassion for the stories of a girl suffering from her secret and love, and a young man who makes a girl suffer without showing her feelings. Despite the tragic end, in the end I was overwhelmed with positive feelings.

	Shiba-san seemed happy to me. Because for me it was the most important thing, I was glad that she smiled at me and said: "It was interesting." Everything was fine until then. However, at the exit from the cinema this guy was. And not only he alone. It was the whole company dining in the dining room, and the twins were the sisters of Mayumi-san in addition to them.

	Shiba-san said in surprise: "Onii-sama." It seems she still unconsciously, by habit, calls this guy "Onii-sama." I think that her habit of considering him a brother can be useful to me. But at that time I could not think about it.

	Despite Shiba-san, standing next to me, I shouted without thinking: "Hey guys, what are you doing?". It looks like I scared Mitsui-san and Shibata-san, but the other girls showed no anxiety on their faces. Chiba-san on the other hand, sneered.

	And this guy brazenly replied: "We came to take Miyuki"! That is, he made it clear that the permission was only for watching the film.

	Do not make me laugh! Of course, I invited her "to the cinema", but that does not mean that when the film is over, it's "all, goodbye"! After that, there will be various ways to go to a cafe or take a walk around the city!

	In the end, they just played with me. Seeing her apologetic smile, I could only agree. Even with such a smile, she was shining.



	Honestly, was it fun? But did it not have to be different?

	Bad character is not only this guy. His whole company, including the girls, is evil.

	Today I am convinced of this.



	March 9, 2097 (Saturday)

	Today I finished my studies at First High. This week from Monday to Friday in the diary, there was really nothing to write. It felt as if the week was sluggish toward Sunday. To myself, I seemed pathetic.

	Today, a permanent dining company gave me a small farewell party. I was asked to return home and change into regular clothes, and then took me to a place that turned out to be an institution with a retro game called "bowling."

	It is not necessary to say that the magic was completely forbidden by the rules, and I tried this game first. Because it was the first time, the result was terrible. Saved at least that I was not the only one.

	Shiba-san, dressed today in a practical knitted sweater and wool trousers, also often drove the ball into a ditch, while smiling shyly. It was difficult to restrain the desire to watch how cute she was trying to hide it.

	Chiba-san seemed to be experienced in this, she had the best rate among girls. And the hatred for this guy was more than ever. Despite the fact that he said that he plays only the second time, his account was so high! Hey, this is my farewell party, I could hold it.

	Although only one person was far away, there was a feeling that not only Saijou and Chiba-san, but also Yoshida and Chinamama-san, look at me with "a fair deal".

	After that, we went to another retro entertainment, called karaoke. Singing Shiba-san was fantastic. It turned out that this guy is singing worse than me, which calmed me down a little.



	10 March 2097 (Sunday)

	Today I decided to return to my parents' home after visiting the Kanto branch of the magical association. But he did not tell anyone about his plans. And yet, at the station near the branch of the magical association, I met her . I was surprised, and the first thing I said was: "Are you here alone?". Shiba-san smiled and turned her eyes. In the distance, but still in sight, this guy stood leaning against a pillar.

	Hmm. Well, manners!

	However, they took the time to say goodbye, we must listen to them, I thought. After exchanging greetings, I gained courage and said this.

	"I was happy to spend this month in one class."

	She rounded her eyes, and then gave me a smile, like blossoming flowers. And she answered:

	"It was fun too, if you have the opportunity, come again."

	Most likely these are just words of politeness. But at that moment I did not care what kind of relationship she had with this guy, and how she treated me. I swore by heart to live a university life on the same campus as she .



	[to be continued]



	Afterword



	On this arch the "Conference of the Main Clans" is over. Did you like it? After Zhou Gunzin in "Unrest in the ancient capital" and Gu Jie now, in the next chapter we are waiting for a new enemy. I think the text is quite possible to guess who it will be ...

	As a small spoiler: a character who was a friend, will become an enemy, and a large-scale magical war will begin. Please, expect this.

	No, Miyuki will not become Tatsuya's enemy, do not worry. The main character this time will be different from the usual, as I was told in the editorial office. I do not think that the description of the character is blurry, but how did all this feel? Speaking of the fuzziness, there was an indication that Ichijo Masaki was all right. I think that I can be like a teenager.

	Shamefully, I'm embarrassed to write this story without knowing the "theory of the influence of internal organs on the mind." Google gives out something on this phrase, but I do not know how reliable that data is. I've seen stories about how people have changed their character and preferences after organ transplants. Since the information about the organs is transmitted to the brain, it can be considered that the organs influence somehow the brain ... I am confused, but I would like to read related books.

	As my personal opinion, I'd rather like that the soul was a separate entity, and not exist in the form of electrical signals in the brain.



	Thanks to this publication in 19 volumes, we were able to finally provide all users with information about the media mix. For the author, this is how to make a big film, having a story at hand, each of the staff can add something interesting from themselves. Please, also wait for us. The content is the original episode.



	The next volume is a collection of short stories. The stories will be described by episodes from the Tournament of the Nine Schools of 2096. However, it is unclear whether this will be "Volume 20". Perhaps it will be a name like "volume 13.5" or "side B".

	Thank you for staying with us this time. In the next chapter, Tatsuya will also begin the final class. "The unlucky pupil at the school of magic" finally comes to a climax. Short editing of the next volume, as well as a new chapter "The Beginning of the Troubles" (temporary title), thank you.
