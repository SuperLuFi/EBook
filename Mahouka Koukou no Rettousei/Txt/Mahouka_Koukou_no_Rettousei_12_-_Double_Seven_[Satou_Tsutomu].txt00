Introduction




It had been 97 years since the day that the supernatural power which heralded the arrival of what is now known as modern magic was observed by the USA at the time. It had been approximately 80 years since the development of magical techniques turned into the development and human modification of Magicians.

During this brief period of time, no, actually it was an even shorter time, as it only took 50 years or so to create a stable production of powerful Magicians – the “bloodlines” that belonged to “famous lineages of Magicians”. Upon further consideration, this was a rather astounding fact - In a mere half century, they had successfully developed the “race” known as Magicians.

Of course, there were a host of reasons lurking in the background. In order to bring about this possibility, more developed countries invested massive scientific as well as economic resources and began a furious competition. Since the start of the latter half of the previous century, energy depletion had turned into a dreaded future that hung like a dark shadow in the hearts of the people (in more developed countries). Furthermore, after 2030 AD, the Earth had noticeably cooled, which was then accompanied by the ensuing food shortage. Caused by the infighting for food and resources, the Third World War became a powerful impetus for the development of Magicians – to the point that basic human rights, a core pillar of society, were abandoned.

Even before the 20 chaotic years of war, the entire globe had already somewhat publicly conducted “human modification” and “human breeding projects”, all in the name of developing a race called Magicians. The fact that magic could be inherited had already been acknowledged in the age where magic was held to be a superpower, which only served to legitimize the progress of magical development towards the creation of “superior bloodlines”.

From the perspective of modifying the human species, developed countries used science to trample human dignity.

The creation of artificial wombs first began in the more developed countries.

Among the less developed countries, individuals with the potential were forced to mate – practically to the extent where nationally sanctioned rape was allowed to occur. However, among the more developed countries, cloning pre-fertilized zygotes and non-surgical methods to gather sperm – “gene selection” – were used to obtain large amounts of reproductive material to fertilize artificial wombs, hereby creating a more efficient approach to the development of Magicians. Genetic modification actually turned out to be the minority. Massive production of “test tube babies” without genetic modification was the true face of the development of Magicians in more developed countries.

Fortunately – that was one way of putting it, given the dissonance between the advances in science and human nature – children born from cloned embryos all died young for some unknown reason. The manner of their birth negatively affected them all. Based on metrics gathered by more developed countries, their average life expectancy was approximately 7 years. Infant mortality lowering the life expectancy was actually not the primary reason. Their lives were really that short, given that the oldest among them died at the age of 17. In addition, their deaths were not caused by rapid aging, but a natural death at a young age. Lives born from natural births failed to display this shortcoming, leading to suspicion that the problem may lie in cellular mitosis.

Still, latent magical talent could be measured at the age of 3. Thanks to their sacrifice, the correct method of matching embryos and zygotes was discovered. This had a profound impact on the second and third generations, to the point that genetic simulations could be used for analysis. Thenceforth, a country only needed to use arranged interviews as an excuse to pair marriage partners, intentionally prompting the families to independently marry on their own.

Thus was born the families renowned in modern magic. In Japan, they were represented by the Ten Master Clans.

The reason why Japan’s “famous lineages of Magicians” became the most refined application in the world was because amongst the various cultural backgrounds for the most developed countries, Japan had the easiest time accepting this sort of marriage relationship.

Isn’t it ironic that scientific advancements that were utterly inhumane were ultimately at the mercy of cultural motivations? Or, should this be the ultimate manifestation of the resilience of “humanity”? That detail will likely be decided by history.





Prologue




A small village sat at the narrow basin tucked between the mountains in the old Yamanashi Prefecture that bordered the old Nagano Prefecture. One with no name. One that was not displayed on the maps precisely because it had no name. Despite calling it a “village”, it was not a village officially planned by the government, nor was it a village that naturally occurred thanks to the people congregating together before the modern era. In truth, it was merely a village for people to live in.

Excluding the fact that there was no name, it was just an ordinary village. Put another way, everything was present save for the name. There was a town hall, police station, fire station, and both the water and electricity were running. The roads were all paved correctly and there was even a school. The only school in the village probably served as both elementary and middle school.

Thanks to the thick clouds in the grim February sky endlessly casting down snow below, a layer of silvery white covered the entire village. Maybe it was because all the villagers were indoors, but outside it was incredibly quiet. There were very few people about, and excluding a group of exactly ten people walking forward, the streets were entirely empty. The lone exception, this group of ten, was currently headed towards the other end of the village, where the village stood with its back facing the mountain. They all wore white camouflage and carried packs of the same color with rifles on over their shoulders.



From a classroom on the second floor, a young girl wearing a sailor uniform watched this dangerous crowd approach. She rose from her seat and approached the window while looking downwards at the fully armed men. She was the only person in the classroom, though frankly, she was the only person in the entire campus at this point. Today was not a weekend, nor a holiday or even an extended break. Maybe the other students knew that the armed crowd was coming and fled for safety. Still, that failed to explain why the young girl remained in the classroom. It was apparent that not only the students but even the teachers had evacuated, so a single female middle school student remaining behind was flat out beyond comprehension.

Dead ahead of the young girl’s gaze, the men unslung their rifles at the school gates. They held their rifles at waist height and split to the left and right along the wall. Three towards the left and three towards the right. Of the four left in the middle, two of them hefted their rifles while the other two set down their packs and removed some sort of item.

The young girl took out a thin, long object from the pocket in her skirt. The machine she held in her hand was very similar to the “tablets” that existed a hundred years ago in an age where information terminals and primary verbal communication devices were called “cellphones”. The young girl pressed the power switch above the number pad, disabled the standby phase, and began channeling psions into the small device.

The machine in the young girl’s hand was a terminal-shaped CAD. Ergo, the young girl was a Magician.

She was watching the two people that stood in the back of the quartet, the ones who had just finished aiming what looked to be RPG-equipped rifles at the school. At that moment—

The young girl’s finger flew across the CAD and activated her magic.



The two men from the armed group brought out RPGs from their backpacks. Rather than focusing on penetration, the short, stubby head was meant to raise the ensuing damage from the shrapnel at the time of explosion, thus limiting its range to within 200 meters. There was less than 1/5 of that distance from the school gates to the school buildings, which was well within the ideal targeting range. However, the explosion never impacted the classroom that the young lady was in.

Ten meters away from the window where the young girl was standing, the RPG round exploded. The flames from the detonation seemed to lap around an invisible wall as it mushroomed outward and the force of the explosion rebounded towards the armed group. The metal fragments within the RPG round rained over the kneeling men. Though the shrapnel had basically lost all of its power and could not harm them, this was sufficient to raise their hackles and wariness.

The two men in the front dropped their packs and started loading grenades onto their rifles. The men who fired the first shots were also reloading. They were well aware that the earlier phenomenon was the result of magic. The reason that the glass in the windows remained undamaged by the grenades’ explosions was because a barrier had materialized, and had properties which repelled heat, sound, and kinetic energy. Still, the men also knew that a magical barrier would collapse if struck by attacks that surpassed its capacity.

This time all four RPGs fired at the same time. Though there was plainly no sign of verbal coordination, their synchronization remained perfect. Even if one round was unable to penetrate the barrier, then shouldn’t the impact and heat generated by all four rounds detonating together overwhelm the barrier? That was the thought running through their minds. Even if this experiment to nullify magic failed, the rebounding shrapnel and force would not be able to harm them. That much had already been proven.

The grenades once again detonated in midair. Much like the first time, the flames from the detonation of all four rounds seemed to spread across a transparent barrier. The only difference, however, lay in the location of that barrier.

Rather than being erected 10 meters from the school building, this time the barrier was erected approximately 5 meters away from the men. To be precise, a fresh barrier was deployed the moment they squeezed the trigger. From this close proximity, the explosive force and scattered shrapnel reflected back onto the men. Though they wore goggles, anything beneath the protective helmet was practically naked. The shrapnel had already shredded their faces without giving them any time to raise their hands to protect themselves. As a result, by the time they regained contact with the ground from the force of the explosion, all four of them had long since lost consciousness.

After verifying that the four targets were no longer moving, the young girl turned and departed from the window. Just as she arrived at the middle of the classroom, the door at the rear of the classroom was brutally shoved open. The young girl’s fingers danced over the keypad as if on reflex, a clear result of endless training. She activated her magic just an instant before the gun-bearing man took a step into the classroom. One foot in the air, the man struck an invisible wall that caused him to lose his balance.

Less than one second later, the door in the forefront of the classroom also opened, but was likewise unable to enter the classroom. As if both of them were putting on a mummer’s show, next to the man who was trying to shoulder his way through the invisible wall, a series of incredible shattering sounds were heard from the glass that separated the classroom from the hallway. Still, none of the shards of glass fell into the classroom and instead shot towards the third man who was trying to shatter the glass. The barriers devised by the young girl not only protected the door, but covered the entire length of the wall between the classroom and the hallway, including the windows and doors.

Just as she let out a sigh of relief after stopping the forced entries, the young girl noticed that the armed group she discovered contained 10 people. Among them, four had remained before her and the other six split between the left and right. Thanks to the effects of their own weapons, the four in the front had already been incapacitated while three others were being held back by her magic in the hallway. So, where were the last three?

A shrill shriek erupted from the window behind the young girl as it shattered to the floor. Men had unfurled ropes from the ceiling, leapt off from the wall and used their own bodies as a swinging hammer to crash through the windows. The instant she turned around, the young girl was already rolling for cover. Her skirt was rolled to a precarious height, but this was not the time to worry about that. As she hit the ground, she spied the men hefting their rifles after jumping in from the corner of her eye. The roar of gunfire and the bullet holes that pierced through the blackboard and the cabinets at the far end of the room proved her decision to be the correct one.

The barrier deployed against the hallway vanished. Thanks to fresh invaders drawing her attention, the Magic Sequence’s renewal had been interrupted. The men performing the mummer’s farce rolled in first. One came in through the back door while another jumped in through the windows. Now, the young girl was completely surrounded by an armed group of six men.

If this was any ordinary female middle school student, her body would already have been shaking in terror. At most, she might have been able to get to her feet, use both hands to contain her shaking and mask her fear while glaring defiantly back at the men, but that would be as far as that narrative went. Yet, this young lass was no ordinary female middle school student.

She got to her feet and sprinted for the back door. There, another man was waiting with a gun in hand, but she completely ignored this man. Seeing the young girl run straight in front of the gun barrel, the man was completely caught off guard. By the time he recovered his wits, there was barely two meters between the man and the young girl. This was too close a range for rifles, but there was no time to switch weapons. Given that he was against a female middle school student, the probability that the man would lose in close quarters combat was practically zero. Still, the man ultimately chose to fire with his weapon.

The other five were much faster on the draw. By the time the man standing in the backdoor of the classroom raised his rifle, the other five men had already squeezed the trigger.

Five gunshots were heard, with another coming a beat behind them.

In the next instant, six screams of pain could be heard.

Incoherent screams of pain erupted from the men’s lips. Even if their opponent was a Magician, the amount of firepower was plainly overkill for a single young girl.

Nevertheless, the bullets were refracted by the physical object reflecting barrier conjured by the young girl and instead shot towards the gunmen.

The guns held by the men were all high powered rifles used against Magicians. In order to penetrate magic fields, these rifles fired penetrator rounds with increased firepower. If struck full on by these high powered bullets that were reflected back, even Kevlar crafted from high quality carbon plates would be useless. The men were sent flying by the impact of the bullets and fell unconscious in the middle, dripping blood all the while. A little lost, the young girl gazed down at them. She appeared to hesitate because she was unsure of what action to take next.

At this time, an old man’s voice came across the transmitter.

“Exercise complete. Rescue teams please recover the Advisory Squad. Sakurai-san please report back to the mansion. Milady would like to speak to you directly.”

Upon hearing the last few words, the young girl involuntarily straightened her back. With an anxious and stiff voice, she replied back “Understood” even though she knew the other side couldn’t hear her.




At first glance, this village was no different than any other village. From inside to out, there was an assortment of flat, blocky buildings made of concrete and steel that had no windows. As buildings that covered air bunkers below, all of these were mass produced during the time of the non-nuclear World War III. Given that these buildings dotted the landscape all over Japan, there was nothing surprising about seeing them here deep in the mountain. –Still, that was only for appearance’s sake.

Yet, this village was not what it appeared to be. This village was a fully equipped experimental lab. The most carefully guarded secret and infamous “Magician Workshop of Death (Four)”, this was the 4th Research and Development Lab for Magical Techniques. This location was both a base and the main headquarters for Magicians’ modification and elimination for the Yotsuba Family of the Ten Master Clans.

The largest mansion in the village was the residence of the Yotsuba Family’s main house. Among the large buildings atop an expansive piece of land, the greatest of them was reserved for the Yotsuba head of house, Yotsuba Maya, as her living quarters.

Now, in a certain room within that main building, a young girl stood stiffly with a nervous expression on her face before Maya.

The young girl’s name was Sakurai Minami, a 15 year old young girl who was about to graduate from middle school and, at the same time, was the second generation of the modified “Sakura” series. Born of parents genetically engineered to grant them powerful magical abilities, she was also a Magician with strong magical powers. As a side note, neither of her parents were among the living. After losing her parents, Minami lived with the Yotsuba Family’s main house while serving as a maid, all the while training to become a future guardian.

The “Sakura” series’ specialty was creating heat resistant barriers that repelled physical objects. Though its functionality and variability were not on par with the Juumonji Family’s “Phalanx”, judged solely on its utility as a defensive mechanism, Minami was able to match the Juumonji Family’s level even at the tender age of 15.

“Minami, first of all I want to thank you for a job well done. This performance was more than enough to rate you a pass.”

“I am overwhelmed by your gracious praise. Thank you very much.”

Compared to Maya’s friendly words, Minami’s tone was clearly tense and stilted. Not that she could be blamed for this, given that the woman sitting across from Minami was not merely her mistress. Even among the Ten Master Clans that dominated the upper echelons of Japanese Magicians, the Yotsuba Family was a particularly powerful clan. Not only was she the head of the Yotsuba Family, she was also feared as this generation’s strongest Magician, the “Demon King of the Far East”.

“Ah, there’s no need to be humble. Don’t you think so too, Hayama?”

Hayama, who had hitherto stood both silent and motionless behind Maya, spoke in a serious tone.

“Though points should be deducted for allowing the enemy to break through the window, the exercise still concluded with the successful incapacitation of all 10 targets. I believe this logically deserves a passing grade.”

After hearing Hayama’s words, Minami’s eyes widened in shock. This was not because she felt that the evaluation was overly harsh. As the head butler who oversaw all the servants in the mansion, Hayama was scant with his praise towards subordinates, yet here he was giving a “pass” to a servant. To Minami’s knowledge, this was the first time this had occurred. On top of that, she was the recipient of such praise, which only doubled her astonishment.

“Speaking of which, Minami-chan……”

“What is your will, milady?”

However, she didn’t have the leisure to remain surprised. There was no way that the head of the Yotsuba Family would banter with a journeyman like herself simply to congratulate her on the results of the exercise. That much was clear without any deeper contemplation.

“You are about to graduate from middle school. Any thoughts on high school?”

“……Haven’t decided.”

“Really, are you still worrying about that?”

Worry was hardly the right word, given that the decision to enter high school was not something she could decide for herself. Minami was indentured to the Yotsuba Family. Even if she said that “she wanted to attend high school”, so long as Maya or Hayama declared that to be “unnecessary”, the point was moot. “Haven’t decided” was akin to “Haven’t received further orders”, so Minami herself had no cause to worry.

“Then, Minami-chan, you will go to Tokyo.”

This order caused Minami to feel 30% comprehension and 70% surprise. A year ago, Minami had heard that she would eventually be serving Miyuki. Still, she assumed that was far off in the future and at least after Miyuki returned to the main house. Though Miyuki’s house in Tokyo was slightly larger than the average dwelling, it was still within the boundaries of a typical residence. A full-time maid on staff would feel somewhat unnatural. Furthermore, a child who had just graduated from middle school would only deepen suspicion from others, Minami thought.

Her mistress swiftly answered the questions churning in her head.

“Go and attend First High.”

Was First High referring to the National Magic University Affiliated First High? That was the only question in Minami’s mind. Since she had been ordered to “head for Tokyo and attend First High”, no further explanations were necessary.

Since registration was now done online, there was no need to worry about the registration deadline. Still, the problem was First High boasted the most difficult entrance examination among the schools. Without any formal tutoring to prepare for the exam, would she be able to pass? This caused Minami to feel deeply uneasy.

“You do not have to worry on account of the exam.”

Were they going to use their connections to get her through? In truth, that was what Minami was hoping for.

“There’s still 3 weeks until the exam. All the necessary information will be directly written into your brain.”

However, that line of thinking was overly naïve. There was indeed such a device in this village that utilized brainwashing as a technique to directly carve necessary knowledge into a person’s mind with or without their consent. Yet, that device seriously depleted a person’s strength. She would likely be bedridden for a week after the exam.

“Do your best. You will be granted a period of time to rest after the exam. Likewise, from tomorrow onward, you are relieved of your duties as a maid.”

As if sensing Minami’s unease, Maya made this gentle yet merciless declaration – “You have no choice”.

“Minami-chan.”

“Present, milady.”

Up until now, Maya’s expression had been smiling, but now she was absolutely serious. Following her mistress’s example, Minami tightened her expression.

“Go to Miyuki’s side. Starting in the spring, Miyuki will be your mistress.”

“Understood.”

This was a mission that was originally assigned to her ahead of time. A steely determination lurking in the midst of her anxiety, Minami accepted Maya’s orders.





Chapter 1




Thursday, April 5th, AD 2096. Today was the day before the opening ceremony of a new school year for the National Magic University Affiliated First High and three days before new student orientation.

In the house of the Shiba siblings, Tatsuya stood before a giant mirror that reflected his entire body with a discomfited expression on his face.

By his side, his sister Miyuki wore a dazzling smile like a flower in full bloom. Actually, before such a brilliant smile, even the cherry blossoms may wilt into buds out of shame. That radiant smile was enough to cause people to deem it “magical”. Miyuki drew so much attention that even the existence of the newcomer standing beside her seemed to diminish. She was the new maid/bodyguard/houseguest sent by Yotsuba Maya to the siblings and would become their underclassman at First High in three days, Sakurai Minami.

With hopeful eyes that fairly shone, Miyuki smiled widely as she watched her brother in front of the mirror. On the cabinet next to the mirror, Tatsuya’s new uniform jacket hung there after being delivered by mail last night.

“Onii-sama, please hurry and don your new uniform so I can see it. Or do you wish for Miyuki to be anxious……?”

Ignoring her would probably throw Miyuki into a sulk right now. For the sake of his sister’s mental health, Tatsuya felt that there was a need to set aside his personal unhappy mood for the moment.

Currently, he was already wearing the uniform pants and full vest, so the only thing left was for him to put on the coat. Tatsuya could only helplessly pick up the sleeve of the suit.

Minami stepped forward as if to assist Tatsuya with the sleeves, but was immediately blocked when Miyuki moved at the same instant. Without feeling put out, Minami returned to her original position.

His sister pressed a hand to the coat while Tatsuya turned around. Miyuki helped Tatsuya into the sleeves of the long suit before working from her brother’s back to the shoulders, fixing the contours.

Next to Tatsuya, who had once again turned to face the mirror, Miyuki drank in his figure with a hand laid against her dazed face as warm gasps of air exhaled from her mouth.

The style and colors were exactly the same as the school uniform for male students at First High. However, there were three particular details that were different from before.

On Tatsuya’s new school uniform, an emblem of eight petals forming a gear was embroidered over the left chest and over both shoulders. A new design, the emblem was the exact same size as the eight petal flower on the Course 1 student uniforms and also sewn at the ends of both sleeves.

“Onii-sama, this fits you perfectly……”

Though Tatsuya himself still felt a little out of sorts with the new uniform, this new design was absolutely integral for allowing Miyuki to vent the aggravation of watching her older brother spend the entire previous year without an emblem to his chest.

That gear was the symbol of the new Magic Engineering Department established this year. In the previous year, Tatsuya had accumulated accomplishments that were undeniable to both within and without. If his “substitute” status was maintained, the school believed that would have a detrimental effect on the student’s image. In the end, the new Magic Engineering Department was established, or Magitech for short.

Of course, the school system wasn’t being changed for Tatsuya alone. Setting aside the reason behind all this for the moment, there was no way the newly created classes could only accept one student.

In regards to this, a fundamental adjustment was made to First High’s class structure.

The number of new students accepted into Course 1 and 2 remained unchanged at 100 students each.

What changed was the procedure involved when these students advanced to Year 2. The new Year 2 students had the option to choose between the original Magic Study or Magic Engineering classes. Students who chose to continue with the original would still be divided into 4 classes of Course 1 students and 3 classes of Course 2 students. On the other hand, students who volunteered for the Magic Engineering Department and passed the examination in March would join the newly established Magic Engineering class with an emphasis on magic engineering in the curriculum.

In the name of devising a new experimental class, First High accepted new faculty dispatched from the university. Though they only began with one class, if the results were positive, the plan was to grant new students who had just enrolled the same option of choosing between the normal Magic Study or Magic Engineering.

Furthermore, as a side effect of the Magitech class’s establishment, Course 2 students were granted access to this class to supplement the deficiency of Course 1 students transferring into that department. This was done based on the practical skills ranking among the Course 2 students. Among Tatsuya’s friends, Mikihiko would be transferred to Course 1 at the start of this year.

Regardless of how they tried to embellish the truth, the fact that the Magic Engineering Department was created because of Tatsuya was blatantly obvious to those who were aware of the details.

Hence there was a reason, and it was therefore natural, for Miyuki to be overjoyed with her brother’s “dashing figure”.



Maybe because she was satisfied after her brother struck a series of poses, Miyuki finally relented and let Tatsuya off the hook. Though he got the impression that he was being treated like a dress up doll, Tatsuya consoled himself with the words “Miyuki is a girl after all”. (Speaking of which, Minami’s new student fashion show had been performed three days ago.)

“Onii-sama, Minami-chan, come have tea.”

Miyuki delightedly proposed to her housemates as she seemed to bounce off to the kitchen. Even the scene of Minami’s seemingly gloomy look at her retreating back was now within the norm. In Tatsuya’s eyes, maybe because of her age – perhaps her youth would be a better way of putting it – and the fact that she had been firmly imbued with a sense of diligent professionalism, Minami was very proud of her duties as a maid (a somewhat rude way of looking at it). For Minami, stealing her task of preparing the tea was something that impacted the meaning of her existence. However, when it came to the importance of “taking care of Tatsuya”, Miyuki would second that to no one. Which is why during the first 5 days after Minami came to this house, the two of them were outwardly pleasant towards one another, but were actually engaged in a furious tug of war. If Tatsuya was someone with a weak constitution, he would surely have succumbed to an ulcer. Fortunately, his physical flesh as well as his nerves and innards were as strong as steel.

With both sides putting their raison d’etre on the line, the result of this quiet war ended in a dubious compromise between Miyuki and Minami.

First, Minami was responsible for cleaning and washing clothes.

Second, Minami was responsible for cleaning up after meals and tea.

Third, when Tatsuya was present, Miyuki would prepare meals. Minami could do so if Tatsuya was not around.

Fourth, when Tatsuya was present, Miyuki would prepare tea. Minami could do so if Tatsuya was not around.

Fifth, Tatsuya’s wardrobe was Miyuki’s domain. Minami would assist with Miyuki’s clothes and garb.

The reason this was dubious was because even now, whenever Miyuki or Minami detected that the other side had left an opening, they would immediately seize the opportunity. Still, in Tatsuya’s eyes, the two of them seemed to be on a relatively friendly footing.

On the surface, Tatsuya and Minami’s relationship appeared to be cordial. –Then again, a soon to be 17-year old youth and a 15-year old girl becoming the best of friends in two weeks was probably a problem in and of its own right. Tatsuya thought as if all this did not affect him in the slightest.

Though this didn’t constitute estrangement, it was true that Tatsuya was of the mind to keep Minami at a distance. Regardless of the slightly downward drooping eyes at the corner, the dark brown, wavy hairstyle, willowy brows, or the dimples that appeared on the sides of her face when she smiled – Minami was too similar to Honami.

Sakurai Honami. The woman who served as his dead mother’s guardian. Four years ago, she had died at Okinawa while protecting Tatsuya.

Like Honami, Minami was born from an unfertilized egg that came from the same “mother” and had also undergone genetic modification before applying sperm from the same “father” to “manufacture” a genetically modified human being whose magical genes had been strengthened – a modified body. Though they weren’t “twins”, they were close enough to be “sisters”. The family tree would list her as a cousin, so it was only natural for Minami’s facial structure to be similar to Honami.

Of course, that extent of the theory was known to Tatsuya. Still, that sort of comprehension was insufficient to explain anything or comfort anyone. The thing that created the estrangement (or something akin to that) was not her appearance, but that her appearance triggered Tatsuya’s memories of the dead.

To the siblings, Honami was someone who was practically family. Upon further contemplation, she was a girl who might have been an older sister. Whenever she was reminded of her, Miyuki was always filled with melancholy and gloomy remembrance. However, Tatsuya’s recollection contained more bitter regret than Miyuki. For Tatsuya, even the reminder that she was practically family only compounded the bitter aftertaste. It wasn’t something he couldn’t swallow, but he still couldn’t help but frown at the bitterness of it all.

—Too powerless—

The struggles Tatsuya bore towards the regret involving Honami could be summed up in that one phrase.

The cause of Honami’s death was physical weakening. If Tatsuya had not met the Great Asian Alliance’s fleet attacking Okinawa, then at least she wouldn’t have died there. The undeniable truth of the matter was that in order to protect Tatsuya, Honami had forced herself to use large scale magic that burned through all of her remaining life force.

However, Tatsuya didn’t regret the decision he made at the time. He didn’t believe that choosing to meet the enemy assault was the incorrect decision. Although his actions at the time were not the product of careful planning and were the result of impetuousness, there was a much higher probability of the situation worsening if he had not chosen to annihilate the Great Asian Alliance fleet. This was not just Tatsuya’s opinion, but the consensus of the research labs in the University of Defense after running multiple simulations.

His regret came from the fact that Honami’s power was even necessary.

Currently, Tatsuya did not need to employ any extra effort when wielding Material Burst. Now that he had learned to set up “Decomposition” as an area of effect magic, Tatsuya no longer needed to rely on Honami’s power to intercept the shots fired from the enemy fleet.

He was just that powerless at that time.

Triggered by Minami’s appearance, Tatsuya was reminded of his powerless self.

“Onii-sama?”

“Ah, I’m on my way.”

Tatsuya fell into a reverie for less than 3 seconds. Miyuki didn’t call out to him because they were pressed for time, but rather because of the subtle change of atmosphere that Tatsuya produced.

He replied back to Miyuki’s call and began walking forward.

Immediately behind him, it seemed perfectly natural for Minami to wait for Tatsuya to make the first move.

Since there were literally only the siblings in the house, the sudden addition of another housemate required purchasing quite a few replacement items. The dining table was one such item. The table was one size larger than before and the surface design was now composed of glass that was able to withstand high temperatures. That said, the table was actually sturdier now and was proof against breakage unless a two-handed hammer was used against it. Considering its moisture resistance and ease of cleaning, practicality was also a plus. –In comparison, the price was also significantly higher. Tatsuya took a seat at the table while Miyuki sat across from him, with Minami sitting to Miyuki’s side.

For some reason, Miyuki still wore an apron. By her side, Minami remained silent though she also wore an apron. Sitting across from two young girls both wearing aprons was certainly an interesting scene, Tatsuya thought.

However, though they were both wearing aprons, the style differed drastically between the two.

Minami wore a full body, long-sleeved frock with a high collar. The thick, sturdy apron practically covered every inch of her body from the front and was clearly designed with practicality first in mind. Even though this wasn’t the “official” European maid uniform from the 19th century, this plainly evoked that impression.

Compared with that, Miyuki wore a mini-gown which daringly revealed the thighs even though it was still early spring. The apron was also the type with thin straps – how many aprons did she have squirreled away – and left the curves from the chest to the collarbone on full display. Naturally, everything below the edge of the apron that was 10 cm above the knees was also uncovered. Through the surface of the transparent glass table, the depths of her thighs could be seen along her knees that were side by side.

Was this little sister of his tempting – teasing him?

Stop, he lost if he started paying heed.

Thankfully, once he made up his mind, he was truly able to put it from his mind. In this regard, he should express thanks to his mother and aunt, Tatsuya thought. –Though perhaps Miyuki bore the opposite opinion.

Still, both sides kept their cards close to their chest as the siblings both raised their coffee mugs and sampled the snacks.

“—There’s only 3 days until student orientation. Minami-chan, are you looking forward to it?”

This was something that had never happened before while the two of them were living alone. Once ignored by Tatsuya, Miyuki feigned obliviousness and changed the topic to Minami.

“Indeed, Miyuki-neesama. I am looking forward to it.”

To the other side, it was possible that Minami failed to pick up on Miyuki’s thoughts or maybe she had no other recourse even if she noticed. At any rate, Minami replied back in a frank manner.

“I’ll have to arrive at school ahead of time that day with Miyuki. Minami, do you mind?”

“That’s no problem, Tatsuya-niisama. Please allow me to accompany you.”

As a side note, “Miyuki-neesama” and “Tatsuya-niisama” were terms that Tatsuya had proposed and Miyuki had given the order to use.

The inherent characteristic of modern public transportation, the train cabin, would usually prevent strangers from sharing the cabin. Nor was there any way to share one halfway through the journey. People who wished to board the same train cabin would either have to live under the same roof or be neighbors, and at the very least needed to rendezvous at the train station.

On the other hand, based on the demands of her role as a bodyguard, Minami could only choose to board the ride that Miyuki took to school. Yet, riding along in the same cabin with a complete stranger would surely be jarring and bring about unnecessary suspicion.

To that end, the excuse they came up with was “Minami is a cousin from the siblings’ mother’s side”. That itself was entailed in instructions from the Yotsuba Family’s main house and the siblings’ census information had been counterfeited in the first place. There would be nothing out of the ordinary even if a cousin with no blood relationship suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

The problem was Minami’s choice of words, such as “Miyuki-sama” and “Tatsuya-sama”.

In the current age, besides an exclusive minority, there were practically no female high school students who referred to upperclassmen who were older than themselves by one year with “~sama”. That minority typically belonged to the upper echelons of society, servants working for wealthier families, or girls who belonged in a serving caste to a powerful family. From the perspective of Magicians, this was a phrase only found in the Ten Master Clans or families of similar stature. Although phrases like “Onii-sama” and “Onee-sama” were already outrageous enough, they were relatively normal when compared to “~sama”.

Miyuki and Tatsuya actually hoped that she would refer to them as “Miyuki” and “Tatsuya”, but Minami adamantly refused. Minami even recoiled from referring to them as “Onee-san” and “Onii-san”. Still, she understood the necessity of concealing their identity, and finally compromised with “Miyuki-neesama” and “Tatsuya-niisama”.

The siblings who had previously lived alone now had to welcome an unexpected addition to their midst, and seemed to be getting along quite well so far.



During afternoon tea, the subject naturally turned to the student orientation 3 days down the road.

“This year’s student representative is a boy…… It’s been 4 years, hasn’t it?”

“Five years, Onii-sama. The Student Council President before Saegusa-senpai was also a girl.”

The topic of the siblings’ conversation was regarding this year’s new student representative, who also happened to have the top score on the entrance examination. Just as the two said, it had been a long time since First High saw a male student as the new student representative.

“Since Saegusa-senpai’s sisters also applied, I thought that this year’s representative would be a girl for sure.”

“Indeed…… Furthermore, if Minami-chan were a little more serious during the entrance examination, then she would be the new student representative.”

“No, that’s hardly the case……”

Hearing Miyuki’s words with a hint of teasing, Minami wore a stiff expression as she shook her head. The main house had ordered her to remain inconspicuous, so it was true that she held back on Magic Power. Even so, Tatsuya believed that if she truly tried her best during the exam, there was a high probability that she could have taken the top spot, but Minami’s passivity seemed to render her unable to treat this subject lightly.

Just as they were about to descend into an awkward silence, Tatsuya decided to change the subject.

“I believe his name is Shippou Takuma. By Shippou, I don’t suppose it would refer to that ‘Shippou’?”

Miyuki wasn’t intentionally putting Minami in a hard spot. She immediately followed her brother’s example.

“Exactly, he is the eldest scion of the ‘Shippou’ Family from the 18 Families.”

A map of the authorities among magical families floated into Tatsuya’s head and crossed with Miyuki’s memories of the files gleaned from the Student Council records to reach a consensus.

“Never thought that Saegusa and Shippou would be in the same year. I wonder if this was a coincidence or predestined fate…… Hopefully they won’t do anything to cause trouble.”

As if getting a foreboding premonition, Tatsuya slightly crinkled his eyebrows.

“I do wonder if they were to create a ruckus, would that help us keep our identities secret?”

“That may also be true.”

What Miyuki was referring to was that the disturbance caused by the friction between the eldest son of the Shippou Family and the Saegusa twins might help draw the school’s attention, which would then take away anyone snooping around regarding Minami’s link to the siblings, or at the very least decrease it somewhat.

These words worked well in theory, but Tatsuya could feel a headache coming on when he thought about who had to take care of the ensuing chaos.



“Speaking of which, in regards to the family party tonight……”

The cups and tray were all empty, so it was about time to clean up. Just as Minami was about to stand, Tatsuya raised a hand to stop her before suddenly changing the subject.

“I believe that Minami should still attend.”

Tatsuya and Miyuki had been invited to the Kitayama (Shizuku’s family) family gathering this evening. Originally, Minami was not supposed to stay on guard at the house, but follow them to the Kitayama mansion and stay on station in the servants’ waiting area, but now that plan was subject to change, Tatsuya elaborated.

“If that’s an order, I will obey.”

Minami’s reply was precisely how a servant should respond. However, her lacking expression seemed to intentionally convey: “I’m really not interested”. While Minami was an introverted young girl, that did not mean she was completely without facial expression, thus when compared to individuals who intentionally revealed exaggerated expressions like Mayumi or Erika, she was actually an easier person to read. –Of course, that required Tatsuya’s level of observation skills.

Forcing other people into obedience was not Tatsuya’s nature, nor did he take delight in ordering her to do things that she disliked. “Since this is an order, I will obey” was not an answer that he wanted. If that’s how the other side viewed it, he was more inclined to say “then forget it”, but once he remembered his earlier words, he ultimately opted against saying that aloud.

“In that case, sorry for putting this on you this time.”

Since he felt the need to put on this show to help increase the persuasiveness of the lie that she was a cousin from their mother’s side, he was not going to back down even though he heard something he disliked.

“Then let’s hurry and pick a dress. I will help Minami-chan, and we’re almost out of time.”

Miyuki clapped her hands together and said this to help break the tension, though she was also probably taking into account her brother’s unexpressed feelings.

And definitely not because she wanted to see Minami’s wavering expression. Probably.





Chapter 2




Despite being called a “family gathering”, this was still sponsored by the financial giant Kitagata Ushio – “Kitagata Ushio” was the industry name Shizuku’s father used – thus the party was fairly bustling with activity and excitement.

Still, no one had the impression that the event was chaotic or unorganized, in spite of the extravagant number of people present.

“A grand area as expected……”

Kitayama mansion might be the only place wide enough to serve as the gathering area and prompt that undisguised admiration from Tatsuya.

Still, his sentiment was not echoed by his compatriots. Miyuki merely smiled as she went along with her brother’s words. To the side, Minami still wore a befuddled expression. In this regard, Tatsuya had more opportunities in the military and at the research labs to interact with “plebeians”, so when compared with the heir (candidate) to the Yotsuba Family, Miyuki, and the servant who had more or less grown up in the Yotsuba Family main house, Minami – what appealed to Tatsuya’s feelings was different than what impacted his sisters based on their varying backgrounds.

The purpose of today’s festivities was to congratulate Shizuku on her return to the country after her short study abroad session in the USNA as well as her advancement to Year 2.

Though she had already returned 2 weeks ago, the reason why this party was delayed so long was because she was preoccupied with greeting everyone.

While Shizuku was one of the finest students at the National Magic University Affiliated First High and a budding Magician of talent in her own right, her identity also entailed being a daughter of a major financial giant. From society’s perspective, her position as the daughter of the CEO came first. Her future as an aspiring Magician (in the end) belonged to her alone, whereas her position as the CEO’s daughter carried the responsibilities towards family, employees, stockholders, and clients.

Owing to these layered reasons, her personal party was pushed back until the day before the new semester began.

The Kitayama Family of five people consisted of Shizuku, her parents, a grandmother, and her younger brother. Still, Shizuku’s father also had an additional 5 brothers and sisters (this sort of family size was hardly odd given that they were wealthy even among the wealthy), and given that Shizuku’s father married late, most of her relatives were older than her. More than half of them had already married and had arrived with their family members in tow, while the single ones brought their fiancé or engaged partners. Hence this family party boasted such enormous attendance. ……At least, that was how Shizuku’s mother explained it to Tatsuya.

“Ushio-kun’s family is an old industrial family that has lasted from the previous century to this age. A lot of people can’t be simply dismissed so easily.”

While cautiously playing along with the lady’s words, Tatsuya had lost count of the number of times he had sighed mentally. For some unfathomable purpose as to why she zeroed in on him, Lady Kitayama, once famous throughout the magical world for her Oscillation-Type Magic as the A-ranked Magician, Kitayama Benio, or Naruse Benio prior to her marriage, seized upon him as her conversation partner the moment Tatsuya exchanged greetings with Shizuku. Speaking of which, Miyuki and Minami had already fled to the sides of Shizuku and Honoka.

“Even so, it’s still hard to put on a welcoming face to someone who was shameless enough to drag a stranger in here. Even with the company at stake, Ushio-kun shouldn’t pamper his family so much.”

Tatsuya mentally concurred. –Shizuku’s mother appeared to be someone with a forked tongue.

Of course, someone who always employed a forked tongue would not be able to survive in the real world regardless of her status as the CEO’s wife (the virtual world was another story altogether), so she probably selected the proper time and place as well as the appropriate conversation partner. However, as to why that conversation partner happened to be he whom she most likely met for the first time currently remained beyond Tatsuya’s grasp no matter how he wracked his brain.

This was not the first time Tatsuya encountered Benio. When Shizuku was sending along the information she gathered from America, he and Miyuki had met Benio that day, but that was only for an instant. He didn’t recall doing anything that would prompt her to strike up a conversation with him.

(However, “Ushio-kun”, eh…… Is it really OK to use that name with all of these people of standing here?)

Starting to get a little fed up with Benio’s complaints, Tatsuya mentally retorted while indulging in a little escapism from reality.

Tatsuya knew the ages of Shizuku’s parents. Naturally, there was no need to go into detail regarding Shizuku’s father and since her mother was quite famous in the modern era, gathering their Personal Data didn’t require too much effort (that being said, with the heavy security surrounding Personal Data in this day and age, a typical individual would be unable to do this). Adding a “-kun” appellation to her husband’s name was not because Lady Kitayama was older. Unlike Ushio, who appeared younger than his age, Benio’s age and appearance were of an accord, so their appearances put them roughly at the same age while in reality, Ushio was older than Benio by 9 years.

(Must be love, then.)

There were qualms to even imagine applying the words “pampered” or “spoiled” to a friend’s relatives.



Maybe she was satisfied with venting all of her internal displeasure, and the ugly glint in Benio’s eyes faded. However, in return, she leveled a calculating gaze at Tatsuya. This time it wasn’t directed towards a “stranger” who had been brought by a relative as a guest, but towards Tatsuya instead.

Though his face was relaxed, Tatsuya felt just as out of place as anyone else would. While he hoped to rendezvous with Miyuki’s group as soon as possible, Benio didn’t seem ready to let him go.

“Speaking of which……”

Benio spoke up even before Tatsuya could excuse himself. Though he was holding back because she was the mother of one of his peers, this was still a contemptible mistake on Tatsuya’s part. –Not that this was anything profound, but Tatsuya was just out of sorts.

“So, are you Honoka’s crush?”

Despite this coming out of nowhere, Tatsuya immediately picked up on the context. Hindsight was 20/20, but if he could have predicted this then he could have prepared a suitable response.

“Setting aside that term for the moment, I am indeed that person.”

To be honest, the name “crush” was something Tatsuya had to resist answering “that’s true”. Though this was just pointless sophistry at this point, it was not something Tatsuya could so easily concede.

“So you aren’t easily flustered. How dependable.”

Somehow, this twisted point appeared to be Benio giving him high marks. Otherwise, he was receiving high marks because he wasn’t muddling through the issue. The smile Benio wore towards Tatsuya turned from summarily polite to something a little friendlier.

“But why didn’t you accept?”

Friendlier, but still with an element of teasing.

“Though she’s not on par with your sister, isn’t Honoka-chan still adorable?”

She must have an interest in watching small animals scurry around in a cage while feeling kinship to them. After successfully passing the first test, Tatsuya’s eyes took on a glint that hoped she was wasting her time.

“I do think she’s cute. Not just her features but her personality as well.”

Tatsuya’s attitude was more or less just playing along for show. Without being aware of what he was looking for, he was carefully scrutinizing Benio for the purpose behind these words without letting a single detail slip by.

“Aha…… If that’s how it is, then this becomes even more confusing. Plainly, facial appearance, body and personality are all excellent, but you still rejected her confession.”

Tatsuya failed to recall that he mentioned Honoka’s body, but this must be what a slip of the tongue was like. Tatsuya planned on ignoring her regardless of what she said, but that appeared to be unnecessary.

Even faster than him, Benio dropped an explosive declaration.

“Also, Honoka-chan already helped you. She will serve you faithfully.”

If this wasn’t an explosive declaration then nothing else could qualify. Even for teasing on her daughter’s peers, this was going too far. From one Magician to another, this was neither proper nor prudent.

An ordinary magic high school student would be completely unable to understand what Benio was referring to.

If they could understand the meaning behind her words, then the natural sensibilities that came along with a 16 to 17 year-old young man should have been unable to hide his exhilaration.

However, Tatsuya only gazed back at Benio’s face with nary an expression on his face.

Benio’s smile failed to crumble, as expected of the wife of a major financier.

“……I see. So you are able to put on such an expression even knowing that.”

However, she appeared to be unable to hide the slight stiffness in her voice.

“I didn’t plan on feigning obliviousness.”

Tatsuya’s voice was definitely something that could not be described as friendly. No matter what her intent was, Benio’s earlier words belonged to a category that could not be voiced aloud. Despite the fact that she was the mother of one of his friends, Tatsuya did not believe it was necessary to converse with her in a friendly manner.

“Is that so…… Knowing the Elements’ power and its potential value, that’s why you refused and took a hands off attitude.”

Honoka’s bloodline – the Elements. Honoka was the descendant of Magicians developed to revitalize traditional magic that came even before the 4 Great Systems and 8 Major Types of modern magic. To those who held positions of colossal power, that bloodline was of incredible value. Tatsuya was well aware of this point, which was the same point that Benio was referring to.

At this moment, the decorous smile on Benio’s face vanished. Her stiff voice changed to a chilly one.

“Don’t tell me, this was all part of your plan?”

Benio failed to clarify what was planned out, but Tatsuya accurately captured the gist of the meaning behind her words just as he correctly read the reprimand and slander entailed within.

“I never planned on using Honoka like that.”

That being said, Tatsuya was not cowed. Nor did he attempt to rebut the injurious words directed at him.

“Yet, you still allowed her to accompany you when you beat back the vampires.”

Benio might have felt that Tatsuya was playing dumb. Frustration was beginning to surface in her words.

“There was no reason to deny her then.”

Tatsuya knew very well the cause behind Benio’s alteration. Even if he missed out on the positive points directed towards him, there was no way he could miss enmity. That was simply the way he had been forged. On the other hand, he had also trained to never waver even in the face of ferocious enmity and malice.

Against Tatsuya, who showed no inclination of becoming enraged no matter what sort of provocation was given, Benio changed the conversation’s direction.

“……Honoka is like a sister to Shizuku. We also see that child like she’s one of our own. In addition, Shizuku has taken a fancy to you. The trust Shizuku bears towards you surpasses the realm between ordinary friends.”

The gaze Tatsuya sent back to Benio inquired her as to the point of all this.

In Tatsuya’s mind, the concern that “this was Shizuku’s mother” had long since been extinguished.

“Which is why I conducted an investigation on you, Shiba Tatsuya-kun.”

Benio watched Tatsuya with a challenging glint in her eyes.

“Though that would hardly be pleasant, I can understand.”

In response, Tatsuya received it with a magnanimous look.

“Who the devil are you? With Kitayama’s…… The information network from the ‘Corporate Alliance’ couldn’t even find your Personal Data!”

“That must have been a mistake. After all, I can’t attend high school without Personal Data.”

Tatsuya’s answer made perfect sense. However, Benio felt that this was the rub.

“Please don’t underestimate adults. It is true that your PD has the lowest level of information, interlaced with extra information that complicated the picture and a few negative reviews, so it wasn’t overly perfect. If I had not heard the things that child has said about you, I would have found nothing suspicious.”

“Is there something suspicious?”

The tone Tatsuya used with his riposte was as lifeless as a machine. His entire attitude practically screamed that he had already seen through the fact that Benio had no concrete information on her hands.

“No, there’s nothing. And that’s why it’s so odd.”

Tatsuya silently watched Shizuku’s mother as she kept glaring at him while chasing her own tail around. There was nothing to say. Those were Tatsuya’s honest feelings on the matter. The only thing he could think of while escaping from reality was that “she’s unlike her daughter in that she’s hot-blooded”.

“Hearing that child talk, you are someone with incredible prowess, no, practically divine abilities and talent. After this face-to-face conversation, my impression of you has only grown even further along the ‘atypical’ direction. Yet, how can your Personal Data be so ‘mundane’?”

Benio’s words were both the truth and mere speculation. Since it was mere speculation, there was no reason to admit to anything.

“Personal Data is just simply information. The actual person cannot be as simple as that.”

Personal Data was the mask created to allow other people to identify him. Whether this mask was close to the truth or not, so long as the fact “it was close to the truth but not” remained hidden, the mask would continue to serve as his existence to the outside world.

“……So you are saying that it is only natural for impressions to differ, is that right?”

“That is who I am. If you ask my name and experiences, then it’s just as recorded in my Personal Data. In terms of impressions, it is just as you have seen. Beyond that, there is nothing more I have to say on the matter.”

On some level, those were Tatsuya’s honest thoughts on the matter. –That is who I am. He was someone who wielded incredibly destructive power on the scale of nuclear weapons and may very well one day shatter the world. So “what” was he? This was the question that he often posed to himself without any suitable answer.

However, Benio was unable to accept that answer.

“Are you trying to play dumb……!?”

Though she tried to curb her volume, that tone of hers was harsh enough already.

With a few exceptions, people who tread through the upper strata of society were able to deftly capture when someone of an equal or higher social standing revealed emotional fluctuations. The sight of the host’s wife fighting with one of the guests was starting to garner attention from the other participants.

“Benio. Settle down a little.”

Although this was called a family gathering, there was no way that only family members were in attendance. She definitely wouldn’t want someone else witnessing that scene of hers, which was why it was only natural for Kitayama Ushio to quickly come over and arbitrate.

“Shiba-kun, I apologize for my wife’s display.”

“Hardly, I believe I am the one who should be apologizing for my insolent words. After all, I am an immature member of the younger generation, so I would be immensely grateful if you could pardon my behavior.”

At Ushio bowing his head and apologizing, Tatsuya also returned the greeting and offered his apologies. Yet, his words were still quite haughty.

Fortunately, Ushio didn’t mind Tatsuya’s rather removed words. There was no sense of renewed anxiety and, just as the tide receded, his eyes drifted from Benio and Tatsuya.

“If appropriate, allow me to excuse myself.”

Tatsuya likely believed this to be a good opportunity, hence his words were directed at Ushio instead of Benio.

“Ah, that’s true. I believe my daughter would like to speak with you.”

Ushio felt that Benio also needed some time to cool down. Tatsuya bowed before walking off in the direction of Shizuku’s group while Ushio pressed Benio’s back as they gravitated towards the chairs by the wall.



“Tatsuya-kun, I’m sorry.”

Upon approaching to a distance where they no longer needed to shout to hear one another, Shizuku beat Tatsuya to the punch and apologized first while bowing her head.

After Shizuku raised her head, a barely perceptible hint of utter embarrassment was tucked within her usual stoic expression. After all, she had invited one of her classmates to her party only to have her own mother trouble them (in Shizuku’s eyes). Even someone other than Shizuku would be downright embarrassed.

“Nothing of the sort, I understand where your mother is coming from. If a man appeared out of nowhere and approached your own daughter, some concern is only to be expected. I thought nothing of it, so Shizuku, please don’t be concerned.”

“……Hm, sorry again.”

The lack of any more refutation was not because she wanted to change her mood (though there were some elements of that as well), but because falling silent was her nature. Though she plainly wanted to apologize even more, that was the only phrase she could muster. That feeling was multiplied against her sense of embarrassment, causing her current awkward expression.

In the nick of time, Tatsuya realized that he was about to rub Shizuku on the head. This was blatantly not his responsibility, but because that overly depressed expression overlapped with a look Miyuki occasionally wore, Tatsuya was about to fall back on “rubbing her on the head” as a reflex.

He was far too relaxed, Tatsuya chuckled wryly to himself as he tucked that thought deeply away before shaking his head and laughing lightly as if to signify “let’s end this here”.



Shizuku, Honoka, Minami, and Miyuki. In the circle of these girls in their glamorous dresses, there stood a young boy in a suit in the middle. Normally, a person in his position would be intensely nervous, but Tatsuya didn’t detect that feeling from the boy. Honoka was fervently trying to engage Minami in conversation while Shizuku was interjecting every so often to prevent her from becoming overly excited. With Miyuki’s assistance at her side, Minami was tentatively replying back. Watching them all, Tatsuya only kept a cursory ear open to this particular conversation arrangement. At this time, he suddenly heard a voice call out to him from behind and turned around.

“Excuse me, you are Shiba Tatsuya Onii-san, correct?”

This young boy appeared to be under the impression that Tatsuya didn’t hear him clearly. Tatsuya responded in the affirmative after the boy repeated his question.

The boy probably hadn’t started middle school yet. Faced with a petite young boy with an adolescent air, Tatsuya had no need to inquire his name.

“Wataru.”

The young boy’s name burst from Shizuku’s mouth.

“Onee-chan. Sorry, did I interrupt you all?”

Yet, the boy’s identity had to be confirmed by his own lips.

“No. Still, be sure to greet them.”

Taciturn as she was, Shizuku’s words may sound cold on the surface, but the gaze she sent towards her younger brother was quite gentle.

Fully understanding her words, the young boy named Wataru tried his best to present a diligent expression – an expression as if he was “putting on a strong front” that was simply adorable – and politely bowed according to his sister’s instructions.

“Pleased to meet you. My name is Kitayama Wataru. I will be a sixth grader this year.”

Wataru had turned his body and face towards Tatsuya in order to introduce himself. Since he was already acquainted with Honoka, there was no need to make any introductions. However, he didn’t spare Miyuki a single glance – he seemed to be avoiding her (so as to not be overwhelmed). After Tatsuya exchanged greetings, he slightly averted his eyes when Miyuki replied, clenched his teeth and tightened his whole body, which only solidified that impression.

Since this plainly wasn’t because he disliked or was ignoring her, Miyuki only considered Wataru’s attitude to be very cute. Still, his indecorous behavior towards her “mistress” seemed to rouse some ill will on Minami’s part.

“I am very pleased to meet you, Wataru-san. My name is Sakurai Minami. I am Tatsuya-niisama and Miyuki-neesama’s cousin. Please take care of me in the future.”

Minami’s greeting was impeccable, but that dutiful smile on her face seemed to lack sincerity. Though this didn’t constitute artificial fawning, it was difficult to hide that she was just observing decorum.

Honoka was the one who stepped up to dispel the awkward atmosphere.

“Wataru-kun, didn’t you want to ask Tatsuya Onii-san something?”

Still, she wasn’t forcibly changing the subject here. Based on Wataru’s earlier behavior towards Tatsuya, he did seem like he had a question to ask.

“Ah, you’re right.”

Wataru’s attention immediately turned towards Honoka. This was not because he was perceptive, but simply how children were.

“Shiba-san.”

There were two people with the name “Shiba” here, but everyone here knew who Wataru wanted to speak with, so no one interrupted him intentionally – including Minami.

“There’s something I want to ask you.”

Faced with an anxious Wataru who finally worked up the courage to speak,

“Sure. So long as I can answer it, of course.”

Tatsuya used an easily approachable tone to reply.

“I wanted to know, uh, can someone who can’t use magic become a engineer?”

The question itself was nothing surprising, but from the mouth of the son from the Kitayama Family, this became odd. Currently, both Shizuku and Honoka wore astonished expressions.

“No. Magic engineers are technicians who use magic techniques for engineering. Technicians who are unable to use magic cannot be called magic engineers.”

However, Tatsuya never hesitated and delivered a frank reply.





“Is that so……”

Hearing Tatsuya’s clear answer, Wataru’s shoulders drooped gloomily. Still, it was too early to throw in the towel.

“Nonetheless, magic engineers are not the only technicians who work in magic engineering.”

“Eh?”

Seeing Wataru raise his head to look at him, Tatsuya revealed a steady smile.

His eyes brimming with hope, Wataru hung on his every word.

“Even without magic, you can still learn magic engineering.”

Tatsuya was not intentionally putting on a show out of pettiness. Even if he was a “villain”, that did not mean “his personality was evil”. –At least, that’s how he saw it.

“While it is very difficult to do CAD maintenance without getting a feel for magic, you can still make CADs without being able to use magic. This is the same for other products used for magic techniques. As long as you study hard, you will be able to obtain the knowledge and techniques necessary to help your older sister.”

“Ah, no, I’m not……”

No matter how he tried to deny it, his inner thoughts were already on full display thanks to the utter embarrassment on his face.

Following that, the gaze he sent towards Tatsuya morphed from one used against strangers (to elementary school students, high school students were adults) to a worshiping one with a respected air.



Unfortunately, adults were unable to adopt the same pure attitude as children.

Watching the siblings who had been completely charmed by Tatsuya from far away, Benio suddenly wanted to sigh.

“What’s the matter, Benio?”

Even if Ushio spoke to her out of concern, Benio could only make a face while resisting the urge to sigh, but did not reply. Her gaze only rested on her husband after he spoke for an instant before once more drifting to where the children were talking and laughing.

“Benio, exactly which part of Shiba Tatsuya-kun do you dislike?”

Kitayama Ushio loved his wife, but that did not mean he was a henpecked husband. Rather, a portion of him was afraid of his wife, but their relationship was not one where he could not voice his thoughts.

“……Ushio-kun, you sound like you approve of him.”

Benio finally turned her eyes back to her husband.

“I think that he’s an accomplished young man. More importantly, he is very talented.”

Ushio’s reply was very frank; another interpretation would be that he hadn’t thought very deeply on the matter.

Benio felt a surge of displeasure on reflex, but didn’t muster any hysterical retort.

“……Maybe even a little too talented.”

However, hearing her voice with those forcibly suppressed emotions, he knew that her mental state was far from peaceful.

“Furthermore, he knows too much and understands too much. Even among the members of the Ten Master Clans I am affiliated with, not a single one of them makes me watch my step as carefully as he does.”

A sigh finally slipped from Benio’s lips. Without sighing, there was no way to convey the concerns she felt.

“For Magicians, being superlatively talented is not a sign of happiness. Instead, happiness recedes from them. Thankfully, Shizuku stopped at the ledge of talent, but if she draws too close to an incredibly talented Magician, then she may be drawn into the misfortune that is drawn to those of overwhelming power.”

Ushio was unable to tell his wife that “she was overthinking this”.

Rather, Ushio laid a hand on his wife’s shoulder.

“Even if it is as Benio says and Shiba Tatsuya brings misfortune, is that really his fault? Avoiding him because of an uncertain future that is no fault of his own is something I cannot agree with. If his strength truly brings misfortune and pulls Shizuku into the mix, then all will be well if we remove that misfortune from their lives. After all, I’m not known as a ‘financial giant’ for no reason. We are family, and I will protect them. You’ll see.”

Hearing Ushio’s strong words, Benio only nodded and didn’t reply.

Nevertheless, she seemed far from accepting his words.



Now it was hard to tell if his strength was too great, but it was true that Tatsuya had the tendency to attract trouble, or at least he was that type. Just as Tatsuya was conversing with Shizuku’s brother, the seeds of trouble came creeping up on him.

“Shizuku-chan, long time no see.”

The person who struck up a conversation with an intimate tone was a young man who looked to be about 25 years of age. Though he gave off a frivolous impression, his attire wasn’t bad or mundane at the very least. Shizuku only nodded lightly in greeting. Though their name was currently unknown, given the familiar air about them, he must be an older cousin from Shizuku’s family.

However, when Shizuku and Wataru saw the young woman by the side of the man, both of them took on astounded expressions. At first glance, she was of the same age as the young man. Yet regardless of her face or figure, both were far beyond the norm. Her choice of dress and jewelry were impeccable, giving an almost mystifying impression. Based on Shizuku and Wataru’s shocked expressions, this beautiful woman was clearly not one of their relatives.

“Ah, I’m going to get married at the end of the year. With her.”

The young man felt the eyes of Shizuku and Wataru on him and frantically explained.

“You’re engaged? Congratulations.”

“Ah, no, she hasn’t gotten the engagement ring from me yet.”

Shizuku politely offered words of congratulation, to which the young man somewhat awkwardly shook his head.

Seeing him like this, Tatsuya thought “for a member of the Kitayama Family, this one sure is a normal young man”. The beautiful woman by the young man’s side who seemed to broadcast her existence smiled at Tatsuya after noticing his gaze.

This time it was Tatsuya’s turn to become astounded. Immediately detecting the change in Tatsuya, Miyuki sent a questioning look at her brother that seemed to inquire “What’s up?”. If this progressed further, Miyuki would undoubtedly follow Tatsuya’s line of sight and narrow her brows upon seeing who her brother was looking at. Yet, before things advanced to that stage, the beauty turned not to Tatsuya, but to the star of tonight’s show, Shizuku, and opened her mouth.

“Well met, Shizuku-san. My name is Sawamura Maki. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.”

In Tatsuya’s mind, this overly simplified self-introduction was not the product of an introverted personality and dislike towards expressing herself, but because others should naturally know who she was without her input.

As if to prove his hypothesis, Honoka asked Maki in a disbelieving voice after being presented behind Shizuku and Wataru.

“Excuse me, Sawamura-san, you wouldn’t happen to be the actress, Sawamura Maki? The one who was nominated for Best Actress in the Pacific Movie Awards for her role in ‘Currents of Summer’.”

“Ah, so you saw that movie?”

Sawamura Maki adopted a graceful smile and answered Honoka’s query. –Though traces of glee could be seen within.

“So it is you! I’ve seen that piece at the movie theater before. It was incredible!”

“Ho ho, thank you very much!”

Tatsuya didn’t watch movies, but he had heard of the fame surrounding the film “Currents of Summer”. He recalled that this movie was the subject of much debate in the previous summer. Based on Honoka’s attitude, it appeared to be a piece of considerable interest. At least, this was a film which prompted people to go see it in the theaters rather than viewing it on one of the mainstream channels on TV.

With a nomination at an international film festival, this woman must be a famous actress, Tatsuya thought. At this moment, Tatsuya lost all interest in “her”. He was originally uninterested in the entertainment business and, from his perspective, there were too many disadvantages to being a famous artist who was the focal point of the media. With apologies to the highly interested Honoka, Tatsuya personally wished for them to quickly leave and seek out other guests.

Alas, reality had other ideas.

“Forgive me if I have the wrong person……”

There was an upward lilt at the end of that phrase, entailing a question. Maki addressed Tatsuya and Miyuki standing in the back.

“You two wouldn’t happen to be Shiba Miyuki-san and Shiba Tatsuya-kun, would you?”

Tatsuya and Miyuki were not naïve enough to appear harried. However, though the degree was different, shock still pervaded their minds.

“Indeed we are. Pardon me, but have we met?”

Tatsuya stepped in front of Miyuki, preventing his sister from once more introducing herself. Directly facing Maki, he offered his own question.

Maki’s reply confirmed that Tatsuya’s memory was correct.

“No, this is the first we have met.”

Then how would you know? Faced with Tatsuya’s wordless inquiry, Maki easily unveiled the mystery.

“He let me watch the broadcast for the Nine Schools Tournament. He said that Shizuku-san would be competing.”

Needless to say, “he” referred to the fiancée by her side.

“I had thought the two of you came straight out of a painting.”

Shizuku was currently speaking with Maki’s partner. The reason why she lowered her voice to prevent Shizuku from hearing was probably because people would misconstrue her praise for Miyuki as insulting towards Shizuku, Tatsuya reasoned. With the drop in volume, the gap between their faces also decreased. There may have been another intent involved, but Tatsuya was under no obligation to indulge her.

“Really? My sister is another story, but I myself am hardly deserving of such praise.”

Taking into consideration the location and person he was speaking with, Tatsuya intentionally used “myself” in the first person. Compared to meeting with Shizuku’s parents, Tatsuya held Maki at an even farther length.

Under the guise of decorum, Miyuki remained silent for the exact same reason as her brother. Both the siblings’ instincts told them to be wary of Maki.

“How humble of you. I was not the only one who thought highly of you two. My friends all concur as well.”

Speaking of which, Maki also listed the names of several actors and directors, but unfortunately for her, Tatsuya hadn’t heard of a single one of them.

“Oh, yes! Do you have time next weekend? If you don’t mind, I would love to introduce you two to our salon.”

Maki invited Tatsuya with a dazzling smile. On one side, she used an innocent expression to express purity while the other half was charming and tempting. As expected of the acting prowess from a famous young actress.

To be honest, Tatsuya’s interest was slightly perked. What drew his attention was finding out exactly what this artist who had nothing to do with magic wanted from him. Tatsuya never believed that codswallop about being drawn to someone’s looks. The glint in Sawamura Maki’s eyes was not something so superficial.

“Though the opportunity is hard to come by, I will have to decline.”

Yet, Tatsuya’s reply was a refusal. Though his tone was conciliatory, there was no room for misinterpreting the meaning of his words or any chance of changing his mind.

“I see.”

In that instant, fury blazed across Maki’s pupils, but was immediately extinguished. Again, as expected of the acting prowess from a famous actress.

“Then, your sister…… Would Miyuki-san grace us with her presence?”

This time she sent a generous smile towards Miyuki. She was able to freely wield a smile filled with womanly charms that was completely free of coquettish airs. Maki’s acting skills were legitimate indeed.

“Since my older brother has already declined, I couldn’t possibly bother you by myself.”

In response, Miyuki immediately replied back in the “negative”.

Before these responses that left no room to maneuver, astonishment suffused Maki’s face. During the time she was unbalanced, Tatsuya slightly inclined his head and Miyuki gracefully bowed before the two of them departed for the dining tables.

Secretly observing their movements, Minami swiftly followed on their heels. Suddenly turning her head, Minami caught Maki sending an ugly look at Tatsuya before hurriedly turning away.

Possibly misinterpreting the glance sent his way by chance, her (self-declared) fiancée returned to her side from his conversation with Shizuku. Maki welcomed him with a wide smile, a smile that contained none of her earlier fury or faltering.





Chapter 3




The antique electric sports car – a replica of the “super sports cars” popular throughout the country between the late 1970s and the 1980s – stopped before the tall apartment constructed in the heart of the city.

“Here will be fine. Thank you for giving me a lift.”

Maki opened the wing-shaped door and stepped out from the low, short vehicle that was practically pressed against the ground. She rose dramatically from her seat as if still in front of the cameras, looped around the rear of the engine, poked her head into the driver’s seat – that being said, this was actually an automatic steering system that happened to provide a seat – and said this after a glance.

Her lover, Shizuku’s cousin, had an unsatisfied expression on his face. However, once Maki stepped closer and stooped to plant a kiss on his face before giving him a dazzling smile, the young man relaxed and started the car.

Although Maki waved goodbye to the antique replica speeding away, once the electric race car turned around the intersection and vanished, the smile immediately faded from her face in favor of a colder expression. The “lover” who could be manipulated with a single smile was expelled from Maki’s mind with a sigh as she walked towards the apartment’s lobby where the elevators were.



With the exception of incredibly tall buildings like the Yokohama Bay Hotel, there were very few buildings in Japan that exceeded 100 meters in height in the 22nd century. This was especially the case for residential buildings. From the perspective of the efficient usage of national soil, it was preferable to construct a series of ordinary, taller dwellings compared with a single, lone skyscraper. With that philosophy in mind, there was a row of “condominiums” here that stood 80 meters tall and boasted 20 stories. Maki’s room was one of them, a corner room on the 20th floor. Through a combination of mirrors and fiber optics, even lower floors had sufficient light, but tenants ultimately preferred higher floors, which was why the top floor commanded the heftiest prices. In order to purchase such an expensive dwelling in the heart of the city, a famous actress early in her career would be hard pressed to do so alone without a sponsor. –That was under the condition that she was just an actress.

“Good work.”

Maki said to the two female bodyguards who stood in the hallway, knowing that their mistress had returned. These were no “followers” that typically accompanied those in the entertainment circles, nor were they interns dispatched by the acting company Maki belonged to. These were guards selected by her father.

In television industry, Maki’s father was the CEO of a stock company with many media companies under its umbrella. Though they were not on the same level as the Kitayama Family, the Sawamura Family was a member of the upper crust of society with considerable wealth at its disposal.

After returning home, Maki first took a shower before changing into a more relaxing dress and robes and sat on the sofa. It was a casual garb that she wore only at home or during that particular type of photo shots. After fiddling with the controls on the side of the armrest, she ordered the HAR (Home Automation Robot) to prepare a bottle of wine and a glass. The surface of the coffee table dipped, allowing the bottle and glass hidden beneath the floor to pass through, then returned to its normal height. This was a common mechanism in high class apartments. By now, this was worthy of neither surprise nor excitement. Maki removed the cork and held the bottle to pour herself a glass of red wine.

Rather than hurrying to sample the taste, she left the glass before her and savored the smell. She wasn’t really planning on drinking alcohol. It wasn’t that she was incapable of imbibing alcohol, but nor was she someone who couldn’t live without the bottle. This was Maki’s ritual to help her loosen her fraught nerves after returning home from the job. On some level, compared to the smell of the liquor, immersing herself in the atmosphere was probably more appropriate.

However, that hardly indicated that she wasn’t drinking anything, and by the time half the contents of the glass had disappeared, her bodyguard opened the door to the living room and came in.

“Milady, Shippou-sama is here.”

“Takuma? ……Speaking of which, it’s almost time for the appointment. He’s a little early, but no matter, let him in.”

It’s not like she was afraid of someone seeing her dressed like this. Without any sign of hesitation on her face, Maki ordered her bodyguard to allow the guest into the living room.

“Understood.”

Even after the bodyguard turned and left, she didn’t frantically reach for her cosmetics.

She was an actress.

Even if she only wore her underclothes, she was more than capable of playing “herself as others saw her”. Against an inexperienced youngster, a slack dress and robe was more than sufficient.



The youth shown into the living room approached with an air of familiarity and plopped himself down in front of Maki without so much as a please. He stood at approximately 170 cm. The young man’s build was slightly thin, and though his face was fair, a faint trace of a childish air remained about him as befitting his age. The reason he gave off a haughty impression was likely due to the burning self-assertion that lurked in his pupils.

“Good evening, Maki-san.”

Both his tone and actions were guilty of acting “older than his years”.

“Welcome, Takuma. You’re quite punctual.”

Maki plainly didn’t pay any mind to Takuma’s brave showing. Still, this sort of interaction wasn’t enough to lift Takuma’s mood. Their relationship had already persisted for a year.

“Anything to drink?”

“No need. Alcohol impairs cognition.”

Takuma shook his head at Maki’s suggestion. –Though there was no invitation to “drink alcohol”, Maki didn’t call him out on that.

“Now that you mention it, it’s about time you told me. After all, that’s the reason you called me here, wasn’t it?”

“True. Let’s cut right to chase.”

Takuma was a little overzealous for Maki’s taste, but faced with a youngster who was almost an entire cycle younger than she was, she wasn’t going to stick to her own style. For Maki, Takuma was neither a younger lover nor her personal gigolo.

“I made contact with Kitayama Shizuku. Unfortunately, it looks like she has only managed to remember my appearance and name so far.”

“……Uninterested in the arts, eh?”

“However, her friend Mitsui Honoka clearly indicated considerable interest, I believe?”

Seeing Takuma make no attempt to hide his disappointed muttering, Maki employed the poise of an actress, no, a superstar as she smiled at him.

“Really?”

Takuma’s attitude shifted (far too honestly) immediately and he leaned his torso towards Maki’s direction.

“Mitsui Honoka is also one of the elites among the Year 2 students. Pulling her into the fold would be of great help.”

“Maybe. In addition, I feel that if her friend Mitsui Honoka joined Takuma’s camp, the chance of achieving a breakthrough with Kitayama Shizuku would rise as well.”

Maki and Takuma were “allies”. For their own personal reasons, they sought Magicians as comrades – or pieces on a board. One of these scenarios involved enticing Magicians within First High with great potential into their camp and becoming friends.

“I think that it would be better to look for companions among your fellow new students first.”

“Our goal is realignment in our respective worlds. Creating a party itself is not the goal, just as capturing a leadership position at school is utterly meaningless. Rather, we should be contemplating how to bring people with massive influence like the Kitayama Family over to our side. Maki, didn’t you believe in that as well, which is why you approached that boring man who happened to be a relative of the Kitayama Family?”

Interrupting Maki’s words, Takuma captured her gaze with a strong look of his own.

“Let’s set Mitsui Honoka as the first target. Of course, you will assist me in this matter?”

Maki turned a smile on the childish fervor that burst forth from Takuma.

“Well, that’s a given…… But Takuma, you better take heed to call her ‘Mitsui-senpai’. If you don’t pay attention normally, you might accidentally address her by her full name at an unexpected time and place, don’t you think?”

A guilty look suddenly flooded Takuma’s face as his eyes wavered.

Wetting her lips with a touch of red wine, Maki wore a languid expression. That was, of course, an act.

“Maki, is something awry?”

Seeing that expression, Takuma furrowed his brows. His question perfectly hit the nail on the head for Maki.

“Something awry…… That’s true.”

Naturally, all of this was hidden away. Maki only put on an act that “accidentally expressed that on her face” and ended with “since you asked, I will reply”.

“As we heard beforehand, Shiba Miyuki appeared at the party with her older brother.”

Takuma seemed ignorant of the fact that was an act. There was no way of knowing whether he was incapable of seeing through her masquerade or he simply didn’t care about Maki’s mindset. He was wholly fixated on her words.

“Dragging those siblings to our side will be very difficult.”

“Did something happen?”

“No, we just talked…… But those two appear to have a special relationship with the previous Student Council President.”

Maki was completely lying at this point. Maki had been dismissed by Tatsuya and Miyuki without a chance to do any information gathering. However, Takuma had no way of knowing this.

“The previous Student Council President…… Saegusa!”

A spike of enmity erupted from the interaction between Maki’s words and Takuma’s own. Fueled by animosity, his emotions covered any chance rational logic could detect the falsehood within.

“This is just speculation on my part, but I think the Shiba siblings are already in the Saegusa camp. Taking out the Saegusa Family in one fell swoop will be difficult now. This is especially true for the sister, who has legions of supporters.”

The hatred burned fiercely in Takuma’s eyes as he bit back in a belligerent tone that sounded stout.

“The more allies you have, the more enemies you will have as well, that’s the law of the world. If they’re the dogs of the Saegusa Family, then we will throw down against one another sooner or later. Bring it on!”

“The sister is the Student Council Vice President, so I think you better abandon your idea of seizing a foothold in the Student Council.”

Maki seemed to implore with her eyes as she watched Takuma, who had leaped to his feet in excitement.

“From what I know, the sister is a serious bro-con and her older brother is detested by many. Wouldn’t it be far more beneficial to use that approach?”

Maki made this suggestion to Takuma in a sincere, encouraging tone.





Chapter 4




Even now in the end of 21st Century, Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya remained Japan’s three largest cities. Although Osaka once suffered dramatic changes in real estate prices, the price of goods was decreased thanks to the advent of a free-to-use airport and being the first harbor to operate 24 hours a day, allowing the city to regain its status as an industrial hub.

Yet tonight, the location of the incident to come was not Osaka, but Nagoya.

The time was approximately 2300 hours. The location was the paths located near Atsuta Park along the riverbanks of the Horikawa River.

“Speaking of which, choosing this practically deserted place as the site of their secret gathering is pretty much screaming that they have nothing to hide here.”

Entirely ignoring the location – in a thicket by the side of the walkways – that was surrounding them, a 15 or 16 year old young girl with long curls and dressed in a gaudy dress that appeared fresh from a lively rock and roll concert, spoke quietly.

“I feel that those words should not be coming from Onee-san who was almost mistaken for a thug at this time and place.”

The voice that replied back sounded low for a girl, but still a touch too high for a boy. Maybe it was impossible to detect whether the individual was a young boy or girl based on voice alone. However, the black, sleeveless miniskirt and frock as well as the stockings of the same color were plainly girl’s clothing. As a side note, a black, high collared shirt with long sleeves was worn on the inside of the sleeveless frock, so the only visible flesh was the hands and face. The bosom was only slightly elevated and the black hairstyle was cut neatly short. From appearances, this was undoubtedly a young girl. However, based on the age of the first young girl and the title of “older sister”, she was either a sister of similar age or they were twins.

“Yami-chan, you’re a knucklehead.”

Although the young girl who was referred to as “Yami-chan” by her older sister furrowed her brows for an instant in displeasure, there were no other major complaints forthcoming.

“It’s precisely because of this outfit that we can be out here like this. At most, people would only think ‘Oh, it’s a delinquent’, right?”

There was a certain persuasiveness to that argument, so Yami had no reply to that. Still, taking into consideration that the mission given to them tonight required a certain degree of movement, clothing that facilitated movement should have been a basic requirement. Now, her older sister was wearing an outfit that hampered her more than anything else, which should not have fulfilled that basic requirement. Still, given that she had chosen a more fluid – owing to certain reasons, a dress was mandatory – set of clothing and yet was still dismissed with a mere “knucklehead”, Yami had a hard time putting that down.

No matter what, she had to muster some sort of rebuttal. The young girl wracked her brain, but a report that came through the receiver she wore over one ear put a halt to that pointless exercise.

“Onee-san, our target seems to have arrived.”

“Confirmed. Coming by boat is certainly a surprise, and a racing boat to boot. Given how eye-catching they are…… Were they not planning on hiding at all?”

On the other side, the large, thickset eye patch that her sister wore over her left eye appeared to be a HMD (Head Mount Display). She rubbed her hand over the surface of the eye patch while her right eye squeezed shut for a moment before snapping open. It appeared to be a hassle even for the person wearing it. Yami thought “You might as well not wear it” while also coming across a more objective phrase and voiced it aloud.

“I believe that the target isn’t trying to obscure themselves. Even if someone saw them, the information would at most be provided to reporters.”

“Reporters, eh……”

Hearing her older sister mutter that word in a suspicious manner, Yami intentionally shrugged her shoulders in an ordinary manner.

“Let’s leave Yoru Onee-san’s theory regarding the media’s untrustworthiness for next time.”

“Yami-chan…… You’ve grown quite insolent!”

The small talk stopped there. The young girl’s intent was not entirely out of fun and games. Completely heedless of her older sister’s satire, she focused her gaze on the racing boat that was approaching shore. The cabin of the sailing boat was not visible from the outside. The boat stopped at the small dock that also served as a stopping point for tour buses. From the boat, two large men disembarked.

A middle-aged man of medium stature who was neither round nor slender greeted the two men. He gave off a shabby impression, but the two young girls were not fooled. Hidden beneath a layer of a business suit, his body had actually been trained through numerous battles. Furthermore, the man’s body gave off the smell of gunpowder.

“That’s a reporter? Looks more like a mercenary.”

“Actually, looks like he has experience being hired as a mercenary. The data should have been forwarded to you just now.”

Yoru turned her face aside to avoid the “Didn’t you read it?” look sent her way by her younger sister. She had already verified the reporter’s appearance. Even if the person in question tried to hide it, they were currently unaware that they were under surveillance. The data image had already identified their target.

“In other words, he was a hardline anti-establishment reporter from the get go.”

“Hmph, a model reporter.”

“I’ll patiently listen to Onee-san’s biases after this is concluded.”

“Did you say bias……? Yami-chan, you’re more than just a little insolent now!”

“OK, OK, it’s about to start. Let’s start with the boat first. Onee-san, it’s all up to you.”

The older sister wore an unhappy expression at being so rudely sidelined, but in spite of their youth, they weren’t so unprofessional that they would bungle their task because of personal feelings.

“I know, I know.”

Although her replying tone was casual, Yoru’s expression had grown serious. She unwrapped the leather decoration covering her left forearm and revealed a bracelet-shaped Generalized CAD. Yoru pressed the power button that was slightly removed from the number pad and summoned the Activation Sequence.

“Well then, I’m setting it off, OK?”

Yoru moved behind her sister. Standing in the gap between the trees, she pinpointed the location of the boat.

Following that, Yami’s body vanished.

In the next instant, Yami stood on the sailboat’s bow.

Mock Teleportation. That was the name Yoru used for this magic. This was a type of magic that removed an object’s inertia (including the human body), surrounded it with a cocoon of air, and created an even larger tunnel of vacuum around it to move the object through that tunnel. Since this was a magic with only four processes that utilized Weight-Type, Convergence, Convergence, and Move-Type Magic, it wasn’t a very complicated technique. Still, it had its disadvantages, such as scouting out the destination prior to forming the surrounding air currents that buffered the tunnel of vacuum. If someone had the ability to repeatedly leap into the air while using this ability, they might even be able to continuously use this ability to confuse their opponent. However, this technique was fundamentally incompatible with attacking and was more suited for fleeing.

Nevertheless, the Mock Teleportation Yoru employed didn’t leave any trail over the river’s surface. She even controlled the air currents that buffered the constructed tunnel of vacuum. This proved that the showy young girl actually possessed an extraordinary caliber in magic.

Using her older sister’s power to charge straight into the midst of their prey, Yami lightly tapped off the deck and stormed into the cabin interior. There were five men waiting there. Much like the reporter who had once served as a mercenary, their bodies had also undergone training. However, unlike the barbaric impression that the reporter left people with, their eyes carried a decidedly loyal and pure gaze.

“Who’s there!?”





The voice rattling off the question sounded a touch stiff. A stiffness that came from the mother tongue being wrenched out of one’s mouth but forcibly changed into Japanese. There were many Japanese people in the Americas and Europe, and the number of East Asian individuals who appeared similar to the Japanese was even larger. Personal identification might have to wait until after the arrest, Yami thought.

Under the light, Yami’s appearance was simply adorable. She had a pair of large pupils within almond shaped eyes with a finely shaped set of red lips beneath a straight, narrow nose. It was such a young girl who had suddenly burst into a cabin filled with only men. The confusion felt by the men was palpable. Not that Yami had any reason to allow these men to recover their wits, of course.

Yami reached out with her right hand. At this point, the men finally noticed that this young girl wore a shining black set of brass knuckles over her right hand.

Yami’s action only served to confuse the men further. Brass knuckles were weapons that increased the force of punches and had little purpose if not within range. Four of the men were actually wondering if this was cosplay of some sort.

“Hey, what’s going on!?”

All of a sudden, one of their companions fell forward. It was abundantly clear now to the men that the situation before them was not a joke. One of them crouched over their fallen comrade and shook his body. He was probably oblivious to the fact that he was speaking in English. The other three men no longer had the leisure to worry about such trivialities.

Just before he could verify that the fallen man had lost consciousness, it was the crouching man’s turn to let out a shout of pain as if struck before collapsing. Yami’s right arm was pointed at the second victim.

“A Magician!?”

By this point, the men had realized the connection between their companion’s collapse and Yami’s right hand. Wherever the young girl pointed with her right hand, one of their fellows fell to the floor. Between the young girl and themselves stretched a distance that was difficult to cover with arms alone. Nor was there any sign of any object being fired from the young girl’s hands. The only remaining explanation they could think of would be a magical attack.

The man who dropped the question was not anticipating any answer. He was just calling out on reflex.

Yami’s hand reached out towards that man and, just like his fellows, the man stretched out on the floor.

“You monster!”

Hatred lacing their words, two guns were aimed at Yami. Shouting alone could be absorbed by the sound barrier that they had deployed ahead of time, but Yami wasn’t confident that they could silence gunshots. Given that the guns they pulled out weren’t even equipped with silencers, they seriously hadn’t planned on covering their tracks.

Still, Yami had no reason to simply wait there to be killed.

One finger pressed a button at the end of the knuckles. The bar she held in hand was the actual CAD itself, whereas the brass knuckles on the outside were just decorations. The Specialized CAD loaded with Yami’s specific magic deployed its Activation Sequence.

This was a magic that directly bestowed pain on the human senses. After sustaining pain as if they had been hammered in the abdomen, the men easily lost consciousness.



After putting down resistance within the cabin in record time, Yami also dispatched the three men at the docks in swift succession before removing a transmitter from a bag on her waist to contact support. Yoru walked towards her as the three layers of her dress fluttered in the wind. The eye patch over her left eye was gone now, probably due to her frustration. With her real face revealed, the older sister’s appearance was actually rather childish. On the other hand, as cute as Yami’s appearance was, it also gave off the same neutral impression that her voice did.

“Yami-chan, have they been identified?”

“We’re matching their appearances now, so we should know soon. The people on board were members of the humanist organization active in the USNA. If we brought them back for intensive investigation, might we have a chance at finding out who is pulling their strings?”

“And the reporter?”

“Based on the transmission records left in the terminal, that one appears to be an independent congressman famous for loathing Magicians. What a careless mistake.”

“Really…… I feel a little disappointed.”

“Yeah. Looks like our intervention wasn’t even required.”

Compared to her older sister’s disappointed smile, the young sister was earnestly complaining.

“Hey, Yami-chan!”

Yet, those words roused a scolding from her older sister.

“How can you use that form of ‘our[1]’?”

That being said, it’s not like it was directed towards the complaints about the job.

“Uh…… There’s no harm in me using ‘our’ once!”

“Although there are girls who use that form, they are still the minority. Separating yourself from the pack and drawing attention to yourself is a big no-no!”

Though the phrase “And Onee-san has the right to talk?” was stuck in his throat, his older sister’s reprimand was undeniable, so Yami could only swallow his retort.

However, Yami’s conflict became completely meaningless with the arrival of the stream of countless men in black.

“Young master, we’re about ready to move.”

The men who looked suspicious under any context directly referred to Yami as “young master”.

“You idiot! It’s ‘milady’, not ‘young master’! Did you want to waste the young master’s painstaking effort in cross dressing!?”

The one who appeared to be the leader of the men furiously struck one of the men in black on the back of the head.

“I’m terribly sorry, young master, no wait, milady.”

“You, you, you……”

“Ah?”

“You completely ruined it!”

The beautiful young girl quaking in fury was actually a cross dressing young boy. In a soft voice, he furiously admonished,

“And that’s not ‘cross dressing’, it’s a ‘disguise’!”

“Yes, yes, it’s a perfect disguise. Even in our eyes, there’s no way we could have thought that it was Young Master Fumiya.”

“What the hell are you doing leaking it all out!”

“Yami, relax.”

Yoru, or Kuroba Ayako, warned Yami, or Kuroba Fumiya, as the latter was rapidly losing control of his volume. As a side note, “Yami” was a pseudonym that came from reversing the last two phonetics of the name “Fumiya”, whereas “Yoru” was devised from the middle character in “Ayako”.

“Still, you guys are all too careless. With that sort of diligence, I wonder how terribly the master will scold all of you.”

The men in black all paled in an instant. Fumiya’s brain also cooled down. A clear sign of how greatly the fear of the “master” was imprinted in their hearts.

“We should not be staying here. Prepare to retreat.”

“Affirmative.”

In an organized and efficient manner, the men in black hauled the reporter and foreigners away in large sacks.

“I’m sorry, Onee-san.”

Left behind was Fumiya, still standing there as Yami, with his head bowed down in shame.

“Oh well, there was nothing we could do anyways. If I had taken your feelings into account……”

“……I am overjoyed to hear you say that.”

Fumiya’s shoulders seemed to slump at his sister’s reassuring words.

“Just bear with it a little longer. Once you hit puberty, there’s no way to disguise yourself as a girl any longer. Though it will be a hassle, we will be forced to come up with another disguise for you.”

“Yeah…… You’re right……”

Though he was plainly a high school student, there was no sign that he was physically unable to continue pretending to be a girl. Fumiya nodded encouragingly to himself as if trying to avoid facing that fact.




On the surface, Zhou Gongjing was the young owner of a popular Chinese restaurant, but he had several other personas on the sly.

One of the more well-known ones was an intermediary who helped transport refugees who were staying in Japan temporarily after fleeing from the totalitarian regime in the Great Asian Alliance to a third country. Not only was he assisting in transportation, he was also providing funding for various resistance movements against the Great Asian Alliance afterwards.

As if to balance the scales, he also served as a spy for the Great Asian Alliance. To be precise, he was the local collaborator for spies. During the Yokohama Incident last October, he had provided assistance to the Great Asian Alliance’s operational units.

Even within the Vampire Incident at the dawn of the year, Zhou had provided critical assistance in aiding the Parasites to secretly enter the country.

Superficially, his secret activities appeared downright treacherous as he aided and abetted both Japan and the Great Asian Alliance, but naturally there was a method to the madness. A student of small government, this political view did influence him somewhat, but above all else, Zhou served as cat’s paw to someone else in order to further anti-Magician activities to damage both Japan and the Great Asian Alliance.

It was deep in the night on China Street. In the basement of his restaurant, Zhou Gongjing knelt in a room that no one else had tread in before. The target he bowed to was a large, humanoid doll dressed in Chinese finery woven with countless gold and silver threads while sitting in a chair. This was a Sorcery Booster medium that had been created from a human corpse, with its entrails removed and preservatives applied before directly modifying the brain. Behind the doll, a gigantic transmission device that rivaled the freezer used for the restaurant sat there with a cable coming out that plugged directly into the back of the skull.

“Great One.”

Hearing the young man’s summons, the corpse that served as the medium opened its eye lids. From within the empty sockets, a will-o-the-wisp was lit.

[Gongjing, how go the preparations?]

The doll let out a rattling voice. Given the obvious lack of any lung movement, the voice was created from Ancient Magic that came from mainland China, Zombification. Using the same technique found in CADs to transform psion signals into electronic ones, the corpse was turned into a communication device that could not be wiretapped.

“Alas, the humanists gathered from America have all been apprehended with the reporter.”

[So the plan to devise sympathetic witnesses has failed.]

Completely the opposite of the utterly revolting voice, the phrases and tone emitted by the corpse were both modern and commonplace. This proved that the one speaking through the corpse’s mouth was no spirit but a living, breathing human being.

“It is as the Great One has surmised.”

Zhou respectfully bowed. Though the corpse doll had no gift of sight, it was still able to convey the atmosphere here. At the very least, Zhou’s attitude was not supplicating.

“Their mission was merely complementary. The project with the media is proceeding smoothly.”

[What is your progress?]

“Approximately 40% with televised media and 30% with the press.”

[Once you reach 50% with the televised media, begin operations at once. Continue until the politicians beholden to the voters are forced to act.]

“As you command.”

Zhou bowed deeply and the doll emitted a satisfied aura.

The will-o-the-wisp in the empty eye sockets flickered out.

By the time the young man raised his head, the doll had closed its eyes.

Zhou rose to his feet and remained facing the doll as he backed out of the basement. After closing the door behind his back, the young man finally sighed in relief now that the doll was no longer in sight. Even Ancient Magic users from the mainland who specialized in Ghostwalker like Zhou had nothing to do with Zombification; speaking to a corpse was always a grotesque experience no matter how many times he did it.

(Well…… I suppose that is a vessel that befits a malicious spirit who carries a grudge against the Great Han.)

However insulting to his leader, Zhou’s private ruminations failed to detract from his devilish smile in the slightest.





Chapter 5




AD 2096, April 6, the first day of the new school year. Tatsuya and Miyuki went to school, Minami stayed home. The cliché phrase “it’s been a while”, didn’t fit, because they had occasionally gone to school for Student Council meetings during spring break.

After today and tomorrow, the two siblings would no longer be alone on the path to and from school. Perhaps because she was conscious of that, Miyuki glued herself to Tatsuya during the short commute from the station even more than usual. From afar or even from close by, their point-blank nearness gave off the illusion that they were walking arm and arm.

From the start, these siblings had become pretty well known among the magic high school students, whose numbers could not be called small. At this time, almost no student did not know of the relationship of the elder brother and his younger sister. The “conventional people” who raised their eyebrows at the impropriety of relatives who acted more like lovers were not just one or two. It was not a surprise that there were no brave souls (or possibly boorish people) calling out to them to take them to task, but the number of people who directed shocked eyes at them was not small.

Naturally, such a thing — being surrounded by those stares — did not make Miyuki anxious at all. For her, people who could not face her and speak up were only riffraff. Even under normal circumstances, it could be said that she accumulated a lot of looks, so the times she wasn’t being looked at were fewer. For Miyuki, other people’s stares were too numerous to be bothered about.

On the other hand, there was no way Tatsuya could “not let the gazes of others bother him” like his sister.

He served as his sister’s guard. He defended his sister from all malicious intent. This was his assigned duty and, simultaneously, a privilege he would not let others take from him. Tatsuya could not ignore any ill will directed against Miyuki.

This was not particularly difficult. Because the trifling ill will was directed at Tatsuya himself, no one was able to direct it against Miyuki.

It was hard to aim a negative eye at Miyuki. For example, even those who felt jealous of Miyuki had difficulty aiming their jealousy. Her looks and talent were too luminous; jealously sent against her became a sort of graciousness. Due to the difficulty of directing malicious intent against Miyuki, a strong will was needed to do it.

Thus, if Tatsuya was aware of it, it was never a mere fluke.

Paired with a strong will, the stare was neither distinctly hostile nor friendly. The look being aimed at Miyuki was of an unusual type. Especially, from the opposite sex, it was even less understandable.

Tatsuya was familiar with the boy’s face. He had not met him face to face, but he had seen the 3D image that had come with the profile. The boy was one year younger than him, the freshman representative—

(—That is certainly the eldest son of the Shippou Clan.)

Unconsciously, his brow furrowed, but Tatsuya deliberately kept his expression from changing. Tatsuya vigilantly kept himself from displaying oversensitivity, but perhaps because he was aware of the intermittent glances Tatsuya sent his way, Takuma averted his face and disappeared into an alley entrance.

“Onii-sama?”

Immediately afterward, Miyuki spoke to him in a doubtful voice. She keenly perceived that a fraction of her brother’s mind had slipped away from her. Even though she could ignore the gazes of the riffraff, she couldn’t ignore Tatsuya’s gaze.

Tatsuya shook his head to tell Miyuki “it’s nothing”, turned around in response to a greeting of “morning” and raised his hand.

Erika, followed by Leo, Honoka, Shizuku, Mizuki, and Mikihiko were in a mass. It wasn’t unusual for all of them to be together after school, but it had been a while since they had all been together on the way to school. Especially Shizuku, who hadn’t come to school with them since before the end of last year, because she had been studying abroad.

Seeing as at last their final member had returned, the faces were all the same, but some of them were wearing a design on their uniforms different than what they had until last month, when they were first years.

On Tatsuya’s breast, there was now an emblem of an eight petal flower surrounded by a gear.

The same embroidered design was on Mizuki’s blazer.

And on the left side of Mikihiko’s chest, there was the eight petal icon of First High School.

“Mikihiko, how does it feel to wear the uniform of the first course?”

“Don’t mock me, Tatsuya.”

Mikihiko answered Tatsuya’s broadly grinning teasing congratulations with a pained but smug smile. They had known that Mikihiko would be transferring to the first course since last month; however, this was the first time they each got to look at each other in their new uniforms.

“How about you, Tatsuya, how does the new blazer feel?”

“Even though you called it new, it only looks that way.”

Mikihiko’s remark had also referred to the fact that the magic engineering course was a new course. Only the name denoted what it was and instruction for the brand new course hadn’t even started yet. Well, not just instruction but everything about the new course would start from today. At any rate, until the day it actually started not even the class lineup was clear; indeed, the feeling of not enough preparations having been made was incontrovertible. The remark about only the appearance being changed was also a joke but it was not without foundation.

“Ooh, cynical.”

However, Tatsuya had a serene, or rather a “it doesn’t really matter”, attitude about it, contrary to his friends’ expectations it seemed. With Tatsuya’s personality, they hadn’t expected him to show great joy about the class separation, but they had imagined he would be a little buoyant.

“Re-al-ly, Mizuki was fairly slack-jawed.”

After Leo, Erika rang out her discontent. She made a sidelong glare of disappointment, but as her opponent was Tatsuya, the dart of her glare passed on right through to the other side.

“I… I was not slack-jawed!”

Mizuki protested without thinking. She hadn’t intended to pay heed to her second course friends (in short, Erika and Leo). But she couldn’t conceal the embarrassed happiness on her face that Erika had pointed out.

“It’s all right not to over do it.”

And as Erika’s mischievous smile showed there was undoubtedly no need for Mizuki to be worried about their feelings.



The Magical Engineering Course classroom in the main school building was in the middle of the classrooms on the side on the third floor. Class E. In short, the room right above the one Tatsuya and Mizuki had been going to until last month.

By the way, Erika and Leo were both in class F. When they found out their assigned homeroom from the school’s wireless, the pair had blatantly displayed their distaste. Perhaps their attitude was genuine, or maybe they were concealing their real feelings out of embarrassment… Only the people themselves knew and, in any case, it didn’t really matter either way to Tatsuya. Though, Mizuki and Honoka were deeply interested.

When Tatsuya entered the classroom, the seats were about half occupied. The five rows of five were the same as last year; the Japanese phonetic order of the seating was also the same as when they were first years. However, did the A I U E O lined up on the sides without regard to gender have a special meaning or was it merely a whim?

After wasting less than a second on solving the meaningless puzzle, Tatsuya went to his own seat. The first row from the hallway, second seat from the front. Like the previous year, Mizuki was in the seat next to him. Well, this had no special meaning since in Japanese phonetics, they were Shi-ba and Shi-ba-ta.

“Mizuki is next to Tatsuya this year too, huh. Maybe I should’ve attempted to change classes as well?”

The one who grumbled the unnecessary joke without caring whether anyone heard it was Erika, who had both her arms on the rail of a wide open window.

“Surely, that’s not needed. You’re in the class next door.”

Leo, who was peering at the face of Erika, who was thrusting her body out the window, followed up with a remark that, contrary to its contents, was spoken in a regretful tone.

“That’s right. Even though we’re in different classes, it’s not particularly inconvenient.”

One year before, this scene would have become an exchange of abusive language, but Erika didn’t follow up with an inflammatory remark or tit for tat. That change was a little amusing to Tatsuya, as that behavior (on the surface at least) indicated agreement with Leo’s words without looking at him even a little.

“Since intruding on another class isn’t forbidden.”

“Only taking instruction in another class is.”

Mizuki promptly showed her agreement with Tatsuya’s statement; she probably thought she could divert Erika. Of course, although she looked wild, Erika had almost never escaped from instruction. Tatsuya was the clear winner in number of times leaving the classroom during instruction.

“That’s also true.”

Perhaps, Erika no longer remembered placing any objections. She readily nodded her assent to Mizuki’s words.

“Nevertheless… There are a lot of unfamiliar faces.”

Erika murmured that as she looked around the room, changing her train of thought. The ostensibly sociable Erika remembered the faces and names of almost all one hundred of the second course students in their year. In short, “the unfamiliar faces” were former first course students.

“Ah, now that you’ve mentioned it… It does seem a little unexpected.”

The number of students inside the classroom had considerably increased as it got closer to the start of instruction, and two thirds of the seats were now filled. That was confirmed by examining the group, and the genuinely sociable Leo, in a voice soaked in surprise as his words suggested, exhibited his agreement.

The pair — no, although she hadn’t piped up to agree with Erika’s statement, Mizuki should be included — the trio had believed that most of the people who would want to transfer into the new Magic Engineering course would probably be second course students. They hadn’t thought that the extremely proud first course students would choose to share a classroom with second course students.

For Tatsuya, although the first course transfers were surprising, it was a trifling matter, so even though he could certainly understand why Erika and the rest had thought that way, he hadn’t broken in with any special comment.

“By the way.”

Erika wasn’t fixated on this topic either. Besides, there was something she was more interested in.

“Tatsuya, you’re being glared at a lot.”

Erika’s remark was affirmed by Tatsuya displaying a slight shrug of his shoulders. Even before she pointed it out, he had been aware that he was on the receiving end of a fixed glare of hatred. And he had already grasped whose glare it was. As for why he was being glared at, since he couldn’t really understand, it might weigh on his mind. Nevertheless, he confirmed that he had more reasons to hate her than she had to hate him. Since merely being looked at didn’t cause actual harm, Tatsuya planned to leave it alone, but it seemed like for Erika, it wasn’t something she could ignore. Her disagreeable voice showed what was going on in the back of her mind.

“She caused all that trouble in so many ways; I wonder if she still hasn’t acknowledged that it was all her own temper tantrum.”

“Even if she knows it was a temper tantrum, she probably can’t just replace all those emotions quickly.”

“Quickly… It’s already been half a year.”

“Only half a year.”

As Erika answered him thus, Tatsuya directed his eyes fleetingly to the origin of the stare, which was off to the side behind him. Flustered, Hirakawa Chiaki, who had been glowering at him in hatred, averted her eyes. Immediately afterward — perhaps she was mad at herself for showing cowardice — she scowled at him with a grim look in her eye.

That attitude of Chiaki’s grated against Erika’s nerves even more. Naturally Erika, who had seen the brave display of introspection by Sayaka, who had been deceived into becoming part of a terrorist group after the incident, had trouble making up her mind about Chiaki’s behavior, since with the excuse of avenging a misplaced grudge, Chiaki had knowingly become a cat’s paw of foreign spies and even now hadn’t apologized to Tatsuya once. On the other hand, Erika, who didn’t have any problem picking fights, did want to go after Chiaki herself, but there was a chance that doing so would cause Tatsuya trouble instead. Besides, Erika felt that Chiaki’s impudent actions just now meant she was “trying to pick a fight.”

A sharp light resided in both of Erika’s eyes. Her eyes did not narrow; to the contrary, both of her eyes were open with the corners of her eyes raised. Although Erika’s beautiful face had a catlike air about it, it was tinged with a ferocity that brought a tiger or leopard to mind. Her appearance even aroused some slight desire to appreciate her aesthetically in Tatsuya; however, if he let this situation go on, he was guaranteed to be embroiled in a whirlpool of trouble. Tatsuya considered the cost of being an onlooker a little too expensive.

“Erika, it’s useless to speak to her.”

Erika turned her sullen face to Tatsuya. A weak willed man would’ve immediately prostrated himself and apologized energetically, but unfortunately Tatsuya didn’t have any such laudableness.

“I’ll put out the sparks I let fall myself. That is, if the other side has the nerve to fan the spark into a flame.”

Tatsuya smiled cruelly. Seeing nothing friendly in that look, Erika calmed down. Perhaps it was an indication that she was showing her regret by trying to conceal her embarrassed smile.

At that point, a voice intervened with good timing and changed the mood.

“Can I bother you for a bit?”

Tatsuya turned around to the voice that called out to him from right behind him. A male student, who had just entered the classroom with an amiable smile, was standing there.

“Is this the first time we’ve properly greeted each other? I am Tomitsuka Hagane. Nice to meet you, Shiba-kun.”

“That’s right, I know your name, but essentially this might be ‘the first meeting’. Shiba Tatsuya. Nice to meet you, Tomitsuka.”

While grasping the offered hand in return, Tatsuya answered in his usual tone. To be truthful, wasn’t shaking hands a little over the top for a self-introduction between fellow classmates, Tatsuya thought, but he didn’t reveal his feelings. Tatsuya’s surprise over Tomitsuka being here also didn’t show on his face.

Nonetheless, Tatsuya’s friends didn’t have a poker face like Tatsuya’s. For example, Mizuki fixedly stared at Tomitsuka, who had sat down right behind Tatsuya, and when she came back to herself, her face turned red. She was probably embarrassed over her own bad manners. Mizuki spoke to Tomitsuka with an embarrassed grin.

“Tomitsuka-kun, nice to meet you. I am Shibata Mizuki. Pleased to meet you.”

“I am pleased to meet you too.”

Tomitsuka’s friendly smile rid Mizuki of her embarrassed grin. Watching what was somewhat a normal high school exchange at last released the other two from their petrified state.

“How unexpected… For the fifth-ranked Tomitsuka to join the Magic Engineering course.”

As her words implied, the awkward words Erika directed to someone were full of surprise.

That was understandable. As Erika said, Tomitsuka was a top class honor student who was ranked fifth in the combined scores of the final exams at the end of their last school year (the top of the overall scores were 1st place Miyuki, 2nd place Honoka, 3rd place a male student by the name of Igara Sousuke, 4th place Akechi Eimi; Shizuku didn’t make the list because she was studying abroad). With such a satisfactory record as a first course student, there didn’t seem to be any need to switch to the magic engineering course. —As far as those with objective eyes could see.

“Are you Chiba-san? As someone who is also from the Hundred Families, I think you might be aware Chiba-san, but my family specializes more in combat than in emergency aid, and I… have a problem with my practical skills.”

A question hadn’t been exactly addressed to him, but Tomitsuka answered Erika while directing a slightly pained face at her. Thus, Erika (and Leo as well) recalled the gossip about the other name associated with Tomitsuka.

Range Zero, a distance range of zero, was his nickname; while it was a title of honor implying the manifestation of matchless strength at zero distance, simultaneously it was an insult that said he could not do distance magic. Actually, it wasn’t that he couldn’t use it at all; however, there was no quibbling over the fact that Tomitsuka had a problem with long distance aiming which he himself recognized.

From the side, Tatsuya sent a lifeline to Erika, who was lost at sea and unable to find words to answer him with.

“Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.”

Was he comforting him or needling him, to this questionable lifeline,

“It sounds persuasive when Tatsuya said it.”

With an earnest voice, Leo broke into the pause.

Tomitsuka’s “bitter smile” changed into a “sarcastic smile”.

“I found you, Tomitsuka-kun!”

Immediately afterward, his complex tangle of emotions was blown away by the cheerful voice that thrust into the classroom of second year class E.

“Akechi-san!?”

In front of the sight of Tomitsuka, who hurriedly turned around, “Amy” — that is, Akechi Eimi — was noisily trotting to him from the classroom’s rear entrance. Due to the fact that she was an athlete in last summer’s Nine Schools competition, she was also an acquaintance of Tatsuya.

There was a large number of high-pitched clicking sounds as the framework of Tomitsuka’s desk brought her to a halt; her hand was raised like she was trying to throw a ball through a hoop in some fashion and her whole face was smiling.

“Morning, Tomitsuka-kun.”

It was as if a “!” and a “♪” dancing were at the end of her words, so energetic was her greeting. Although they both had carefree personalities, Eimi was different from Erika whose joyfulness was concealing the wounds in her heart — Eimi was joyful to the core. She was the valuable type that made those watching her feel that the worries they were moping over were foolish. Despite the scene just now, due to Eimi’s arrival, all awkward feelings had been wiped from the atmosphere.

“Ah, yes. Morning, Akechi-san.”

Tomitsuka was drawn by the charm of that energy. No, the feeling given off by the look on his face was not “Eimi is charming Tomitsuka”; “Eimi is overwhelming Tomitsuka” seemed closer to being correct.

“Shiba-kun, morning.”

“Morning, Amy. Come to think of it, Amy and Tomitsuka were in the same class last year.”

“That’s right. You’re well informed?”

“It’s a minor thing.”

Tatsuya sent a smile drained of energy at the wide-eyed Eimi.

“Amy, this girl is Shibata Mizuki. This is Chiba Erika. The one over there is Saijou Leonhart. The three of them were my classmates last year.”

Mizuki and the others shouldn’t have had any interaction with Eimi. And Tatsuya’s hypothesis was not off the mark.

“Nice to meet you. I am Akechi Eimi. Call me Amy.”

Tatsuya had introduced the three simply (carelessly?) and Eimi had readily introduced herself in return.

“O.K., Amy. It’s all right if you call me Erika.”

The one who immediately responded was, naturally, Erika.

“Please call me Leo.”

“Nice to meet you, Akechi-san.”

Leo followed with a (supplementary) self introduction and Mizuki bobbed her head. As she did so, for some reason Eimi puffed out her red cheeks in dissatisfaction.

“Amy.”

“Eh?”

“Didn’t I tell you to call me Amy?”

Mizuki could not understand what she’d done to make Eimi angry and her eyes showed guilt and innocence. If you looked at it objectively, Eimi’s insistence was nearly irrational, but cases where force triumphed over reason had been observed repeatedly in the world. Anyway, Erika and Leo were dumbfounded since they didn’t know what kind of girl Eimi was, and Tatsuya, who somewhat knew her, was not showing any intention of intervening for some reason. And the other person who knew her, Tomitsuka, appeared to be merely impatient and reluctant to intervene.

“Umm… Nice to meet you, Amy. It would be fine if you addressed me as Mizuki.”

In the end, although she was puzzled, Mizuki gave in.

“Yes. Nice to meet you, Mizuki.”

At once, Eimi smiled openly. The smile was more foolishly naïve than pleasant; it had the effect of making people slightly doubt that the selfish manner of speaking she used had really taken place.

Satisfied, Eimi nodded and pivoted her body to turn towards Tomitsuka.

“Now, it’s Tomitsuka’s turn.”

“Uhh?”

Why had the conversation turned to himself? What the heck did she mean by his turn? Tomitsuka was completely dumbfounded by this too rapid turn of events.

“Amy.”

Eimi once again voiced her nickname.

Tomitsuka still didn’t understand what Eimi was demanding from him. The puzzled Tomitsuka looked right and left and became aware that Tatsuya was enduring the scene with a smile.

Tomitsuka asked for help from Tatsuya by eye contact. Tatsuya constructed a sober expression to answer Tomitsuka’s 911 call.

“You don’t like being called Akechi-san, right?”

Tatsuya’s hypothesis was on the mark it seemed, as Eimi nodded yes-yes.

“Don’t you want Tomitsuka to also call you by your nickname?”

Eimi’s sullen display with Mizuki had foreshadowed this. Well, Tatsuya had already expected this development so he hadn’t said anything during the previous episode.

On the other hand, Tomitsuka’s face started to flow with cold sweat.

“Eh, umm, Akechi-san, you called me ‘Tomitsuka-kun’ and…”

“Oh? So it would be all right if I called you ‘Hagane-kun’?”

So that’s it ~ you should have said so earlier ~ Eimi said with her eyes while she leaned toward Tomitsuka, peering up at his face with both arms behind her back, holding her hands together. Tomitsuka was clearly flustered to anyone’s eyes. The lukewarm eyes of Tatsuya and the others went to Tomitsuka, who was leaning backwards with an even stiffer face.

“No, um, that isn’t exactly what I wanted to say… Ah!”

Tomitsuka was desperately trying to avoid meeting the eyes of Eimi, who was blissfully staring at him, and he deliberately stood up and raised his voice when he caught a stare flowing at him from two seats away.

“Akechi-san, let’s have this talk next time.”

Evading Eimi, who had blocked off half his field of vision by leaning forward, Tomitsuka walked toward the seat of the girl that had been looking at him.

“Is that you, Hirakawa-san? You’re in this class as well?”

Tatsuya and the others were just barely able to catch Tomitsuka’s voice from where they were. They weren’t able to catch Chiaki’s diffidently whispered words of reply at all.

“Amy, is it all right not to follow him?”

Erika spoke to Eimi, who looked sullen about being abruptly left behind, in a purposely low tone.

“Do you think there’s nothing you can do now but retreat…?”

Was this the whisper of a devil tempting a human heart into sin, or was it the voice of an angel to someone facing a hard road. —Of course, it wasn’t such a grandiose thing; it was simply nothing more than the utterance of an imp egging on her fellow schoolmate, but the effect was instantaneous. Eimi nodded with a determined look and rapidly went after Tomitsuka.

“…You are one scary female.”

To Leo, who was not quipping but whispering it in a somber tone,

“This way is more constructive, right?”

Erika answered with a broad grin.

“Certainly, this is an extremely interesting development.”

A bit of surprise mixed into the shocked look Mizuki gave to Tatsuya, who was looking at the gazes of undisguised curiosity that onlookers directed at the three of them, Tomitsuka, Eimi, and Chiaki, which he just pointed out.




The youthful drama of which Tomitsuka was the lead actor (or perhaps the prey) was taken care of by the ringing of the bell. After Eimi left the Class E classroom at a lively trot, Erika and Leo went to the Class F classroom.

Afterwards, there was no ceremony for the first time all the students were assembled for instruction. The stance of the school was that getting the information needed was an individual responsibility. From now on, this class would have a teacher in charge of their practical skills (just like classes A-D in the first course). Over half the class considered not even displaying the name of the teacher until the actual day it started to be pretty over the top, but Tatsuya was part of the minority who didn’t think so.

It probably hadn’t been decided til the last minute — if Tatsuya’s supposition was completely accurate.

After all, if the number of magicians qualified to be teachers hadn’t been inadequate, then half the students that they had the capacity for at First, Second, and Third high schools wouldn’t be placed in a lower caste.

Taking the dearth of personnel into consideration, the teacher in charge of Class E’s practical skills instruction would be a fairly eccentric individual for a magician educator and might not be much of a teacher, Tatsuya predicted. For example, very elderly or perhaps the opposite, fairly young. If all the instructor was going to do was teach practical engineering skills, then the teacher would not need to have a great deal of skill as a magician, so the possibility that they might dispatch a researcher without any qualifications as a teacher was also within Tatsuya’s expectations.

However, thirty seconds after instruction was to have started, a practical skills teacher stood in front of the entire second year class E who did not meet Tatsuya’s expectations. It also seemed like the teacher was not what the other students imagined either, as a small commotion ran through the classroom.

The one who appeared was a woman in her forties.

Of course, that alone wouldn’t strike anyone as unusual. There were clearly more male instructors in magic high schools, but female ones weren’t all that unusual. The surprise came from the woman’s looks.

Her hair was blonde. The color of her eyes were blue. Her skin color white. Her body was tall and her legs were long from this and her other physical traits; it was clear from looking at her that the woman was a Caucasian of Nordic descent.

“I am Jennifer Smith[2].”

She gave her name in the style of English speaking countries and her full name was an English one.

“I am originally from Boston, but I became a naturalized citizen eighteen years ago.”

However, these words melted the majority of their doubts. If that much time had passed since she had been naturalized, then there must be no worries on the security front. Normally, the patriotism of naturalized citizens (toward the nation that naturalized them) was required to be firmer than that of the citizens born in a nation. If they did not display more loyalty to their new country than to their former country, then their naturalization wouldn’t be recognized. In the case of a magic researcher with many chances to connect with national secrets, this is especially true. There was still the question of why she would throw away her nationality to become a naturalized Japanese citizen when the USNA was not only the wealthiest nation in modern era, but also had the most cutting edge magic techniques, but to Tatsuya that was comparatively unimportant.

“Until the end of the last school year, I was a professor at the National Magic University, but from this school year on, the main school has placed the instruction in magic engineering for this class in my hands. I look forward to working with you.”

She is in the same situation as Tsuzura-sensei, Tatsuya thought. Tsuzura’s back-story was that his too independent mind had caused his downfall. What could be the circumstances in Smith-sensei’s case? —Tatsuya considered that hypothesizing she was a troublemaker was both rude and arbitrary.




They had to register for electives by the end of first period, but from the second period on they immediately started on the regular curriculum; it was now the noon break.

Tatsuya arrived at the Student Council room.

He was, from now on, a Student Council Vice President. Tatsuya had transferred from the Public Morals Committee to the Student Council due to a secret agreement between Azusa and Kanon; however, this was the result implemented by completely ignoring Tatsuya’s own will. Since he didn’t have any lingering attachment to the Public Morals Committee and he didn’t object to joining the Student Council, Tatsuya hadn’t put up any resistance, but if, for example, Tatsuya had made a show of resisting, then he probably would have been persuaded after all. —Not by Azusa, but by Miyuki. Perhaps, Tatsuya didn’t try to resist because he understood that.

Whatever was going on in the background, First High School’s new regime for the AD 2096 new school year was safely launched. The Public Morals committee had also added new members. Mikihiko had been approved as Tatsuya’s successor under the recommendation system by the Student Council. From the clubs, Shizuku was chosen to supplement the lack of members brought by the end of the last school year. Today was the first day of the new school year and in the Student Council room, the roster of Azusa, Kanon, Isori, Tatsuya, Miyuki, Honoka, Shizuku and Mikihiko, in the spirit of a “welcome new members” party, were holding a luncheon.

The student council meeting table was a little cramped for eight people. Perhaps Kanon thought that was a good excuse for totally gluing herself to Isori. While the pair’s passionate — Isori looked a little uncomfortable — scene seemed to embarrass Azusa and Mikihiko, Tatsuya and Shizuku were poker faced, Honoka seemed somewhat envious and Miyuki looked at the scene with a smile; lunchtime proceeded harmoniously.

By the way, while Honoka wanted to take Kanon’s lead and glue herself to Tatsuya because it was cramped, with Miyuki’s standard attitude unbroken she couldn’t muster the determination.

After the meal ended, each of the eight received a tea cup or a coffee cup according to their preferences. The one waiting on them was the 3H-P94, Pixie. The girl-shaped robot was originally on loan to the Robot Research Club; however, due to various circumstances, especially because Pixie itself wished it, from today on it became something for Tatsuya to use in the Student Council room.

The topic of their first lunchtime conversation was the new Magical Engineering Course’s unique choice of professor. However, close to halfway through the noon break, their interest turned to the imminent admissions ceremony.

“Is there another rehearsal after school today?”

Mikihiko, who had not been involved in the preparations for the admissions ceremony, asked, politely conscious of the presence of the upperclassman,

“It’s more of a business meeting than a rehearsal. There are only two formal rehearsals — one during spring break, and one immediately before the ceremony. And since we’re only practicing the program, we won’t be reading the formal address.”

Miyuki replied in her default polite tone for speaking to male students.

“Last year as well?”

“Yes.”

Miyuki, who had made the formal address last year, replied to Shizuku’s follow up question also.

“Eh, really? It did not look that way at all.”

Kanon’s response displayed her surprise in a way that looked slightly exaggerated. Naturally, for that reason, the person herself immediately spoke up.

“Our turns were pretty tough… Because it’s hard work, I thought we’d hold many rehearsals.”

“At any rate, it was rough…”

As was her apparent habit, Kanon belatedly cut off her words just after she committed a verbal gaffe. Azusa, who had been employed as the freshmen representative the year before last, was timidly sinking into a deep depression.

“Well, well. Nakajou-san was nervous. That’s not particularly unusual.”

Isori quickly followed up after his betrothed’s error on one side,

“Of course, Miyuki not getting stage fright was not all that peculiar.”

And Tatsuya followed up after Isori to prevent Miyuki from taking it the wrong way.

“Dear me, Onii-sama. Even I was nervous.”

Miyuki’s timing was not very natural when she spoke from her place next to Tatsuya, with both hands clasped on her thighs. In that state, she leaned her upper body to peek up at her elder brother’s face. While making a pained smile at his sister’s expression with slightly puffed cheeks, Tatsuya lightly caressed Miyuki’s hair, making her return her head to the original distance. Miyuki let out a small “Ah…” and sent a bashful smile to Tatsuya. Shizuku jabbed Honoka, whose face had frozen in an “Aargh”, with her elbow in her flank, and Kanon, who was closely sticking to Isori, looked innocent and unaware of her own inappropriateness.

In the confused atmosphere, Mikihiko deliberately coughed to return things to normal. And Tatsuya spoke to Mikihiko, whose face showed the effects of his effort to cough as if nothing had happened.

“Actually, neither Miyuki or myself has met this year’s freshmen representative face to face yet.”

“That’s because the school takes the lead in preparations for incoming freshmen.”

Upon taking note of Tatsuya’s words, Isori, who was more cognizant of the details than he, entered explanation mode.

“Even though the student’s autonomy is respected, an event like the admissions ceremony, which has many distinguished guests attending, is of course another matter. Nonetheless, the Student Council handles the preparations on the current students’ side.”

“Are you saying… That the incoming freshmen aren’t yet students of our school?”

“No, Mikihiko, that’s absurd.”

Without reservation, Tatsuya used a one-liner to deal with Mikihiko’s meaningless words. The trace of envy that could be seen in Isori’s eyes over their easy relationship with each other was surely only an illusion, of course.

“We don’t know the real reason. So this is only a hypothesis to us.”

With the smile still pasted on Isori’s face, his actual feelings were not something that could be glimpsed.

“Nakajou-san, have you met him face to face?”

When Isori changed the topic, Kanon displayed an interest without delay.

“You mean Shippou-kun?”

Azusa cast down her eyes as she pondered when gazes filled with curiosity turned toward her.

“I have… He seems like an eager boy.”

She probably did not want to prejudice them against him. Azusa had chosen harmless and inoffensive words, but,

“An ambitious boy, eh.”

Seeing the lightly pained smile Azusa gave when Kanon put her words into blunt terms then, it seems that Azusa also actually shared the same opinion.




The living room after dinner. In accordance with the division of labor, the dirty dishes were left to Minami and Miyuki was preparing coffee to Tatsuya’s tastes. To his sister, who had sat down next to the side table she had placed her own coffee on,

“If you consider his position as the eldest son of the Shippou family, he probably can’t help being an ambitious person.”

Tatsuya started the conversation like that with a soothing voice.

“Onii-sama, why are you suddenly bringing up Shippou-kun?”

With both her hands folded together and placed on her thigh, Miyuki tilted her head inquiringly in a polite ladylike manner. There was no way Tatsuya was fooled by her formal face.

“Just because he has his reasons, there’s no need for us to bend over backwards. As long as we don’t have a quarrel with him, we don’t need to be any friendlier to him.”

“I did not quarrel or anything like that.”

As Tatsuya had been telling her not to pick a fight in a rather roundabout way, Miyuki looked the other way with a sulky look. —For her to take that attitude could only mean that she was somewhat self aware. He would hesitate to call the first meeting between Miyuki and the eldest son of the Shippou Clan one of compliments and friendliness.

Naturally, a quarrel had not been started from Miyuki’s side. At first, Miyuki also intended to welcome the freshmen representative that had become her junior warmly, nevertheless…



“Let me introduce you. This is Shippou Takuma-kun, who is serving as this year’s freshmen representative.”

After school in the student council room. Azusa was introducing him to the officers who were all present — Isori, Miyuki, Honoka, and Tatsuya — and Shippou Takuma bobbed his head quickly. This attitude was fairly common for a freshman which continued when it came to Isori,

“Vice President Shiba Tatsuya. Nice to meet you, Shippou-kun.”

Just as Tatsuya introduced himself, there was a complete change.

“Shippou, Takuma. Pleased to meet you.”

There was an unnatural emphasis on the family name in his way of speaking, but his language was within the bounds of politeness. However, his attitude could not be called all that polite. Takuma wasn’t looking at Tatsuya’s face, but his left chest.

“…Shippou-kun?”

When Azusa spoke softly to him, Takuma looked a little taken aback and afterwards put an awkwardly friendly smile on his face.

“Pardon me. The gear shaped emblem Shiba-senpai is wearing is unfamiliar.”

Hearing Takuma’s excuse, Azusa nodded “Ah, I see.”

“It is the emblem of the new Magic Engineering course that started this year.”

“Oh, that’s it.”

Although he probably didn’t mean to do it, he cast out his acknowledgement in a rather careless manner, indicating his lack of interest. Tatsuya did not consider that to be offensive. The Shippou clan’s trump card “Million Edges” was unusual for Modern Magic, because the technique did not use a CAD. Tatsuya had heard gossip from his fellow engineers that the Shippou clan had a tendency to neglect Magic Engineering, perhaps for that reason. Everybody had their own way of looking at things. To him it had value, but he could not force other people to share his sense of values.

However, it was not something Miyuki could overlook. A haughty expression, a disrespectful look in his eye. A foundationless confidence of one’s own superiority and contempt for someone for no reason. The eyes of this freshman were wearing the same look as her fellow freshmen last year, who scorned her elder brother as a “Weed”. This could be felt by Miyuki.

Takuma, who immediately had to continue greeting people, turned to the next person. He did not intend to cause an uproar at this time and in the first place, Takuma was not aware of the rudeness of his behavior. It was not that he was being somewhat insensitive; one probably had to be very sensitive to how his rudeness would be taken. So he was not especially prepared for the next student council officer — in short, for turning his eyes to Miyuki.

Immediately afterward, he visibly flinched which for Takuma was undoubtedly a disgrace. However, it had been inevitable. Because right then.

The Snow Queen descended.

Being in the presence of a blizzard princess or the like was not a gentle experience. An aloof face could be called ordinary; however, this ordinary face was a signal to prepare for a life or death struggle to previous Student Council officers. It was still far from the level it reached at that time — the Student Council Presidential election last year — however, it was not shameful that Takuma, who was experiencing it for the first time, should lose his composure due to the pressure being emitted.

Nonetheless, Takuma himself did not think so. He couldn’t help giving off a mortified look. He rapidly constructed a courteous smile, but looking at it objectively, it was not a very good one.





“Fellow Vice President, Shiba Miyuki.”

As fitting of her cold expression, Miyuki spoke only this statement for her self introduction.

“—Shippou Takuma. Nice to meet you.”

The shaking in Takuma’s voice was not out of fear but anger. He was disgusted with himself for being overwhelmed by Miyuki. He retained enough self control not to transfer the anger he felt at himself to other people, but Takuma was a naturally passionate boy. In order to restrain himself, he ground his back teeth. No matter how much he tried to smooth over his expression, it wasn’t enough to conceal it.

The attitudes of Miyuki and Takuma could not possibly be called harmonious. As the atmosphere gradually became more turbulent, Azusa started to get flustered. With last year’s officers, Suzune would have followed up as the next one in this setting, but Isori, who held the same position this year, looked like he was unsure of what he should do.

Miyuki’s actions were childish for an upperclassman; nonetheless, Takuma’s conduct was also not the desired courtesy from a new student. The sense that they were both equally at fault was stymieing them.

The only one here now who had the potential to rebuke Miyuki and bring the situation to an end was Tatsuya, who was silently examining Takuma’s facial expression.

…Afterwards, due to Honoka’s forcefully cheerful self introduction, the thorny atmosphere lightened a little. Nonetheless, the atmosphere of the meeting remained strained in the Student Council room for the rest of the meeting.



There was not any type of rehearsal today; it was over shortly since they were only going over an already-decided program. If they had had to continue in that atmosphere for a long time, they would have had to worry about the outcome of the entrance ceremony. —If the tradition of inviting the freshmen representative to join the student council is taken into consideration, then it was already at a level that the potential harm to the Student Council’s activities had to be a concern.

“But I didn’t think we would suddenly be glaring at each other. The Shippou Clan’s eldest son apparently has a belligerent disposition.”

The attitude I took was not wrong, thought Miyuki. However, no matter how justifiable the reason she had — feeling that he had looked at the elder brother she loved and respected with scornful eyes — that did not change the fact that she had despoiled the mood of the Student Council. So Miyuki had prepared herself for a light scolding. So while she was in the mood to fend off the questions of her elder brother, who hardly ever rebuked her at all, Miyuki agreed with Tatsuya’s words in a hesitant tone.

“I thought his attitude toward Onii-sama was not simply a type of insolence. I felt that he was concealing hostile intentions toward you.”

Now, when she looked back calmly, she believed that Takuma’s attitude was a little different from the one displayed by her classmates immediately after they were enrolled last year. He wasn’t disdaining Tatsuya as worthless, he was set on forcibly acting superior in order to deal with an enemy from a subjectively superior position… no, Miyuki corrected herself; he did not have the luxury of keeping it concealed.

“That’s right. He was watching us.”

Tatsuya knew that the hostility from Takuma was more towards Miyuki rather than himself. This morning on the way to school, the person Takuma had been looking at intently as if he was glaring was not Tatsuya, but Miyuki. Tatsuya felt that the hostility directed against himself was simply appended to the hostility toward Miyuki.

On the other hand, Miyuki had not considered the idea that she was the main target and Tatsuya was only an additional target even a little bit. Miyuki was aware that Tatsuya had said “us”, but in her own mind, she persistently put her elder brother as the greater and herself as the lesser.

“I do not comprehend the reason, but I believe it is best if we do not take it too lightly. Not like last year.”

Miyuki was talking about the incident that had taken place immediately after they enrolled last year caused by the domestic terrorism organization “Blanche.” The impetus for the siblings to become deeply involved in the terrible situation that developed when terrorists infiltrated First High School had been Sayaka’s invitations to Tatsuya. At first, Tatsuya had taken it lightly, only considering it “an invitation to join in club activities”.

It was questionable if there would have been any changes in the developments that happened afterward had things been considered seriously. The consequences (for the siblings) had not been all that great. However, to Miyuki, her brother’s attitude that “everything will be okay if we don’t get into a fight with him” as the way they should react to Takuma’s challenging manner was reminiscent of the time with Sayaka, that he felt there was no need for caution.

“Last year? Ah, no, it probably won’t become anything like that? After all, he is a member of the Twenty-Eight families.”

By the Twenty-Eight families, he referred to the Ten Master Clans and the eighteen associated clans, which wasn’t a common way to refer to them. Only someone who was referring to their common origin in the magician development research laboratories would lump the Ten Master Clans and the eighteen associated clans together as equals and use that expression for them.

“I wouldn’t know anything about Shippou Takuma’s natural disposition, but…”

While holding his coffee cup, Tatsuya muttered something like a monologue.

“It is said that because of their rivalry with the Saegusa clan, the Shippou Clan has the strongest desire to ascend to the position of one of the Master Clans among the eighteen associated clans.”

Miyuki knew of the hostility between the Saegusa clan and the Shippou clan, but this was probably the first time she heard the rest of it. She listened to Tatsuya’s comments with a deeply interested look.

“He only wants his own power acknowledged because he really craves the spotlight, like most boys around our own age.”

“Well, are you like that too Onii-sama?”

“Well, about that. Ordinarily, I too would want that.”

Tatsuya answered her with a wry smile, feeling like he was being teased by his little sister when she asked him that.

“It seems that Shippou-kun has the kind of desire to be in the spotlight that makes him work twice as hard as other people. He probably wants to demonstrate that he has power suitable to be a member of the Ten Master Clans. So perhaps he acts hostile to people he feels might hinder him.”

“But we are not doing anything in particular to hinder Shippou-kun, are we?”

“For someone who wants to be acknowledged by those around him, people who are already acknowledged are a hindrance.”

Miyuki agreed with the words Tatsuya related to her with a wry smile and a deep nod.

“I see. In short, Shippou-kun is jealous of Onii-sama’s reputation.”

Tatsuya almost spit out his coffee in response to the comment Miyuki made to indicate “her understanding”.

“No, Miyuki, the one he recognizes as his rival and feels jealous of is probably you.”

“Me?”

Miyuki asked with her eyes if Takuma had really disregarded her Onii-sama to focus on herself, to which Tatsuya nodded his head countless times.

“He is this year’s freshmen representative, you are last year’s representative. That is enough of a reason to view you as a rival. Additionally, you were very active in the Nine Schools Competition. Doesn’t he view me as hostile because I am Miyuki’s hanger-on?”

“Absolutely not…! Onii-sama isn’t Miyuki’s hanger-on or anything like that!”

“No, it’s alright not to get excited… I’m just making an assumption about how Shippou-kun looks at me.”

“I will not accept any ridiculous assumptions like that.”

“Even if you say you won’t accept it…”

Tatsuya felt a little bit at a loss about how to handle Miyuki when he suddenly pressed one of her buttons.

“Rather it is I who is Onii-sama’s… No, I must reluctantly admit that Onii-sama is my very important partner.”

In the portion that was mumbled out of embarrassment, he heard “Onii-sama’s belonging” but Tatsuya didn’t let it bother him. To Tatsuya, the way she rephrased it was bold and fairly embarrassing but he ignored it as well.

“If we reconsider once more, there is also the possibility that he views us as hostile because he knows we are related to the Ten Master Clans.”

He pointed this out in a nonchalant tone, but it had enough weight to bring Miyuki’s mind back down to earth from where it had been lightly whirling around.

“He knows that we are related to the Yotsuba? Aren’t you overthinking things, Onii-sama?”

“That’s true. I don’t believe he has — no, rather the Shippou clan has — the ability to penetrate the Yotsuba’s control of information, but… I feel that there was some kind of strong impression of something of that level in his eyes.”

What Tatsuya was recalling was not the scene in the Student Council room where they glared at each other, but the intermittent staring Takuma had done at Miyuki on the way to school. Miyuki was unaware that Takuma did that, so right now what her brother was saying didn’t ring any bells.

Even so, Miyuki housed her brother’s worry in her heart.

“That’s true… He is a member of the Twenty-Eight Families, it might be better to be cautious.”

…It was the right answer that the hostility directed to them related to the Ten Master Clans, but the idea that it was because they are related to the Yotsuba was completely wrong. The right answer would be because they were suspected of being related to the Saegusa, but neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki hit on that possibility. Even though they were friendly with Mayumi, for the pair who never forgot the complicated relationship between the Yotsuba and the Saegusa, being seen as part of the Saegusa’s clique was something that would never occur to them.





Chapter 6




April 8th, the morning of the first day of school for First High School, which was attached to the National Magic University.

Today, there were no ill mannered stares lying in wait for them on the route to school; all three of them, Tatsuya, Miyuki and Minami, arrived at First High School two hours before the admissions ceremony. It goes without saying that commuting to school at this hour was in order to make preparations for the entrance ceremony. The three of them went straight to the site of their first appointment, the auditorium’s preparation room. Minami was bothered by the fact that she, herself, was an outsider, but since she had not acquired much experience escorting Miyuki, Tatsuya had forced her to accompany them.

Isori and Honoka were already gathered in the prep room.

“Good morning, Tatsuya-san! Morning, Miyuki!”

“Morning, Shiba-kun. Right on time.”

As Miyuki and Honoka exchanged greetings, Isori spoke to Tatsuya to their side.

“Good morning. You’re early, Isori-senpai.”

“It’s my nature. If I don’t come early, I can’t stay calm.”

After he smilingly answered Tatsuya’s greeting, Isori’s eyes went to Minami, who was waiting behind Miyuki.

“By the way, who is that girl? A new student?”

“Of course, Minami.”

“Yes, Tatsuya-niisama.”

“Niisama? Shiba-kun, do you have a younger sister other than Miyuki-san?”

In a sense, Isori had given him just the question he wanted.

“No, she is my cousin.”

Tatsuya replied with the lie he had prepared before hand.

“Minami, this is Isori-senpai.”

“Nice to meet you, Isori-senpai, I am Sakurai Minami. Thank you for the care you have always given to Tatsuya-niisama and Miyuki-neesama.”

The overly polite speech Minami provided to greet Isori at Tatsuya’s direction did not cause Isori to display any feelings of unease.

“Nice to meet you, Minami-san.”

“I’m very honored to meet you.”

Just as Minami once again sent a polite nicety towards Isori, Azusa, Kanon and the first year representative, Shippou Takuma, entered. (By the way, Kanon had already made one round of checking the guest chairs.)

“Good morning… Could it be that I’m the last one?”

“Good morning, President. You are precisely on time.”

Miyuki replied to Azusa, who had asked that question with a slightly surprised look, with a smile. Actually, she was three minutes late, but Miyuki’s smiling face carried the intimation that any further apologies would not be allowed.

“Good morning, Isori-senpai, Shiba-senpai.”

After getting Azusa to swallow the apologetic complaints they expected from her, Takuma stepped forward from behind her and spoke to first Isori, then Tatsuya.

“Morning, Shippou-kun.”

He made a silent bow to Isori’s reply and then turned around to face Miyuki and Honoka.

“Shiba-senpai, Mitsui-senpai, good morning. Please take care of me today.”

Could he be nervous? Compared to the attitude Takuma hit them with the day before yesterday, the change was laudable.

“Good morning, Shippou-kun. Please give it your all today.”

However, Miyuki was not a gentle girl who could be moved by something like that. Her smile was magnificent, her tone was gentle. The perfect face of a lady in what was known as an impeccable social mask. Only Takuma’s attitude had changed; he had not apologized for his rude manner the other day. Miyuki did not intend to make any concessions from her side as long as he didn’t make any apologies to her elder brother.

Azusa and Isori looked confused by the smile so formal that no one could complain about it. With nothing to indicate ill intentions, they could not rebuke Miyuki. On the other hand, they could not let the uncomfortable mood that had started to spread simply be. Azusa requested help from Tatsuya with her puzzled eyes.

“Since all of us are here, let’s go over the order of the ceremony first.”

However, Tatsuya’s only answer to that was to continue speaking as if nothing was wrong.

“That’s right, we shouldn’t waste time.”

Without a moment’s delay, Kanon provided supportive agreement. She too had probably decided that they needed to forcefully gloss over this scene.

“Then, starting with the arrangements for thirty minutes before the admissions ceremony. The guiding of guests is Miyuki’s charge, the reception room is Honoka’s…”

This was originally Azusa’s duty, but Tatsuya was not concerned with that as he continued with the rehearsal arrangements. It wasn’t right for Minami to be in this place, but no one pointed it out and it was completely forgotten.

And the rehearsal immediately before the ceremony proceeded safely in the strained atmosphere that did not allow them the luxury of feeling pressured by the imminence of the actual event. Azusa and the others breathed a sigh of relief as it finished; in spite of the entrance ceremony starting in thirty minutes, they were very relaxed or rather they were in an exhausted state. Tatsuya thought they were letting their attention wander a little too much, but it wasn’t Tatsuya’s job to point that out. Besides, it was better than getting so worked up beforehand that they were useless when the main event started. Reconsidering things, Tatsuya set about his own work.

“I’m going to guide the new students.”

“Oh; take care, Onii-sama.”

“Ah, thank you for your work.”

As Miyuki and Azusa saw him off from the side of the stage and Minami bowed a silent goodbye, Tatsuya departed from the auditorium.



His duty before the ceremony was to guide students who didn’t know where the event was. Last year, when Tatsuya met Mayumi, it was because she was assigned with the same job. When he heard that at the end of March when the jobs were assigned, Tatsuya hadn’t felt it was a suitable job for the student council president, who had important duties just before the actual ceremony. However, he had now reconsidered and he thought it might have been an excuse to go outside and relieve her tension.

There was no way he himself was tense to that extent. Nevertheless, he was aware of a slight sense of freedom. Perhaps this was only natural, to be more at ease outside in the wind instead of inside preparing for a formal ceremony. Maybe, he resembled Mayumi on this point.

Possibly, because he was thinking about that stuff,

“Ah, Tatsuya-kun.”

“Saegusa-senpai? Good morning.”

Soon after he ventured in to the front yard, he unexpectedly met with Mayumi.

“Saying ‘it’s been a while’…… Would be strange. Are you the new student guide?”

“Ah, well.”

“So you joined the Student Council after all.”

The student assigned the task of guiding new students wouldn’t be anyone other than a member of the student council. However, the Public Morals Committee members were also patrolling in order to police the grounds, and temporary officials were also making the rounds. Thus, she should not have been able to conclude that he was an officer of the Student Council just from his answer, but Tatsuya did not say anything to refute the happily giggling Mayumi at all. He had, in fact, joined the Student Council, and another matter had caught his attention.

It did not really need saying, but Mayumi had graduated from First High School last month. Therefore, she wasn’t wearing a uniform; this too was only natural. However, it probably couldn’t be called “expected” for her to be here in attire that looked very mature.

This was not the first time Tatsuya had seen Mayumi in non-uniform clothing. Last summer, when they departed for the Nine Schools Competition, he had seen her in a fairly spectacular summer dress. However, at the time, although she had been showing more skin, he hadn’t felt like he was seeing a different person.

However, the Mayumi who was now clad in a feminine suit seemed older and a different person than she had been last month. The frills from her blouse were arranged in her chest area, she had a short jacket, and she also had on a tight skirt which did not give off an impression completely different than that of a high school girl. Could it be because of her deep red high heel pumps? Could it be because she had augmented her coloring with light makeup? Could it be because she had exchanged her large hair ribbon that held back her hair for an amber colored barrette? Perhaps, everything from the top on down created the effect, and more than anything else, Mayumi had gone up one more rung of the ladder to adulthood.

“Not even a month has passed since graduation, but… for some reason, you don’t recognize me, Tatsuya-kun.”

While Tatsuya had been thinking about those things, Mayumi, herself, on the other hand had claimed “that he didn’t recognize her” and penetrated the — what can probably be called inevitable — hole in his defenses.

“That may be true.”

Mayumi smiled warmly at Tatsuya, who had just barely managed to reply.

“Eh. That uniform… It’s the Magic Engineering Course, right? It’s different from last year’s.”

“I think my uniform is the only thing that’s changed.”

His comment wasn’t to hide his embarrassment — it was his actual opinion. That was what he really thought, but,

“No, I think you may not be aware of it yourself, but last year when we first met in this same season, the Tatsuya-kun who was wearing the Second Course uniform had a completely different look than the present Tatsuya-kun. Compared to last year, you look more at ease.”

Tatsuya did not dispute the claim Mayumi was making because he could not dispute it.

The fact was that he himself was not aware of it. That he was not self-aware was the truth.

To put it plainly, he had a bit of an inferiority complex about ordinary things.

“I concede. I do not understand my own self.”

Tatsuya bravely raised a white flag. This was not merely lip service. “Even though you try to understand yourself, you really can’t” had been a bit of ancestral wisdom that had been around forever; he thought from his heart that this was the reason for his admission of defeat. However, seeing Mayumi just throw out her chest in triumph, a seed of rebellion sprouted within Tatsuya.

“You called it failing to recognize you, but I think Senpai has changed way more than me.”

“Oh, really?”

“Yes. You’re completely a university student. You look very mature.”

“Re-Really? It’s just barely past the entrance ceremony.”

She spoke as if to deny Tatsuya’s impression, but Mayumi’s not at all displeased look and bashful manner were obvious. (By the way, the university admissions ceremony was on April 6th.)

“Yes. From that barrette in your hair to those grown up pumps, they suit you very well. Like you’re another person.”

“Teehee, really… You say.”

Mayumi was no longer trying to conceal anything, but she looked like she came to a sudden realization when her smile cracked and her face abruptly hardened.

“Tatsuya-kun… what do you mean by that…?”

No, it was not like she came to a realization. Evidently, Mayumi had realized something,

“Do you mean I rely more on them?

To make myself look different, more mature?”

She herself was being made fun of by Tatsuya.

“In short, you want to say I used to look childish…?”

“You’re over-thinking this.”

Naturally, Tatsuya was not so weak willed as to easily acknowledge his own misdeeds. Faced with Mayumi glaring up at him with upturned eyes, he made his face look sober and honest and answered with a voice that matched that face.

“I have never thought even one time that Saegusa-senpai’s face or figure was childish.”

“Face… figure…”

It seemed like Mayumi had received some kind of shock. Looking at her objectively, only her height was short; her face and figure were not childish. Anyone would say her face was the cute type, but it was not “childish” and her voluptuous proportions could be called extremely mature for her age.

Nevertheless, apparently Mayumi had a hidden complex about — she wasn’t really all that short — her height. Disregarding Tatsuya’s denial, she was probably interpreting his words in the worst way.

“Is something wrong?”

“No, I’m fine.”

As she answered Tatsuya’s words — in which she didn’t hear all that much concern — in a confident tone that was half bluffing, Mayumi was once again glaring up at him.

“So Tatsuya-kun, what did you mean by a different person?”

“It doesn’t really have a deep meaning. It’s a common phrase.”

The persistently questioning Mayumi made Tatsuya feel like “he had failed.” This was not a topic he intended to speak on at length. He didn’t intend to make light of Mayumi, but he could not have her occupy all his time. —Come to think of it, why had Mayumi come to her alma mater, thought Tatsuya at last.

“Really? I don’t think so.”

Mayumi made a straight forward appraisal. The “upturned stare“ transformed into “a scowl at point blank range”. Mayumi herself probably wasn’t conscious of it, but a spectator would mistake it for unwanted closeness.

“No, really. …By the way, Senpai, why are you here today?”

Mayumi displayed an “ah” look and a “Hey, you!” in a shrill angry voice reached his ear at nearly the same time.

“Get away from Onee-chan! You skirt-chaser!”

At first, Tatsuya did not understand that those words were directed at himself. Because the label of “skirt-chaser” was completely unwarranted. However, he saw that the petite girl that matched the shrill voice was coming down the path between the rows of cherry trees directly at him, and he became aware that apparently, this situation — the difference in the heights between Tatsuya and Mayumi had concealed what was actually going on — had been mistaken for something else.

“Kasumi-chan!?”

On the other hand, from the word, “Onee-chan,” and the distinctive voice, Mayumi had understood that the remark was aimed at them. Mayumi turned toward the girl who was running to them and immediately looked back in Tatsuya’s direction and vigorously took one step backwards. Clearly flustered, perhaps she had some kind of clue of how the girl had misunderstood the situation.

Tatsuya knew the girl called “Kasumi-chan” was Mayumi’s younger sister even without looking at the new student registry. If her cordial relationship with her male junior was misunderstood by her younger sister, then it was only natural for her to be flustered, thought Tatsuya. However, he felt that her response seemed to be a little too energetic.

His momentary concern did not turn into a needless anxiety. It was probably the high heels that led to the disaster. No, Mayumi should have had many chances to attend formal parties, so it probably wasn’t that she was unused to shoes with high heels. So she had probably been careless with her footing when she moved unexpectedly.

Before Mayumi had tripped and fallen, Tatsuya had calmly considered the possibility. Completely from a bystander’s point of view. If he could have just kept looking and been done with it, he probably would have accepted the label of “heartless” without complaint, but as usual he was not so lacking in human feeling.





Mayumi, who had stumbled, was swiftly supported by Tatsuya. He had grabbed Mayumi’s shoulders with both hands. He did not grasp her hip area in an overly familiar manner and of course he did not insolently accidentally touch her breasts.

“Ah, thank you…”

Therefore, Mayumi thanking him while looking embarrassed was simply because she was bothered by falling when there was nothing to trip over.

However, it seemed Mayumi’s sister didn’t think so.

“I said get away from her, right!”

Immediately after she screamed that. Mayumi’s sister — Kasumi’s body gently floated up. The petite body accelerated mid-air without forming a parabolic line, floating in a straight line with a knee protruding out to attack Tatsuya’s face.

Tatsuya stopped that knee with one hand. He did not block it with his forearm — he caught it in his palm. Being high in the air adding to the power, the shock went up and the inertia fled to the ground.

Mayumi looked up at the spectacle with her eyes so open that they were perfect circles, but Kasumi was even more surprised than her sister. It was better than being blocked or knocked down, and if it was a ballet lift, it would have been praised exultantly. As her movement conditions were forcibly altered, Kasumi’s Acceleration and Movement-type combination magic lost its effect.

Without the assistance of magic, the one knee above the palm posture was an unstable stance. As one should expect, Kasumi’s balance was destroyed. Her petite body tilted violently.

Before she tipped over completely, Tatsuya released the body he caught by one leg and lowered his hand.

“Whoa!”

The shriek she raised could not be called very cute, as Kasumi fell in a pitched forward posture. If she made contact with the soft coat of the pavement of the front yard in this manner, then even if she didn’t hit her head, she would probably be wounded on her palms and knees enough to cause bleeding. As a look for attending the entrance ceremony, it could be called a very pitiful one. That would be a very tough trial for a girl who had just barely become a high school student.

In order to prevent this tragedy, Tatsuya would have to catch Kasumi’s body as it fell — which he did not. The reason was not that he didn’t have enough time to react. His cold eyes pursued the process of the girl who had just become his junior falling down. The knowledge that she was Mayumi’s sister did not have any significant impact on his decision making process. Although the attack had failed, the fact that the girl had launched an attack on him was more important and significant to Tatsuya. Besides, if he had caught this girl’s body as she fell, he would have shown the other girl a hole in his defenses.

“Ah!?”

Tatsuya understood from observation why the girl raised her voice hysterically.

A Magic Sequence had pasted itself to the girl’s body. Her falling speed slowed. A protective barrier of data fortification protected the girl’s body so that neither the Eidos or the skin were damaged. Normally, this phenomenon wouldn’t occur unless the magician applied the magic to his own body, but a third party had cast it.

As Kasumi landed gently undamaged, almost at the same time, Tatsuya made a big leap backward. Three meters in front of the space he vacated, a girl, who aside from her hair style looked exactly like Kasumi, with the same face and body type, rushed over to Kasumi, who was on both her knees.

“Kasumi-chan, are you okay!?”

“Izumi, you saved me. Thanks.”

Side by side, they really were like two peas in a pod. Even a person unaware of their background information would probably conclude from looking at them that they were identical twins. Of course, Tatsuya knew the pair were indeed twins.

Saegusa Kasumi and Saegusa Izumi. Within the Numbered, the sisters were known, without irony or whimsy, as “The Saegusa Twins”.

Even though their faces were identical, their auras differed greatly. From looking at Kasumi, who was emitting signs of aggression with her curl-less hair cut in a short hairstyle, she was probably very sports oriented; possibly she was some kind of martial arts practitioner. On the other hand, Izumi, who was clothed in a graceful, gentle aura, had straight hair cut to give her bangs reaching her eyebrows and hair that touched her shoulders evenly; perhaps she was a bookworm, as she looked like she might be an indoor type of girl. From her words just now as well as her tone and expression, he knew she was flustered, but somehow she did not seem all that nervous. —At least on the surface. However, Tatsuya felt that this was the one he should be more wary of.

It was somewhat rude for Tatsuya to stare at someone when it was their first meeting, but they were all doing it. They all had blatant looks in their eyes but Tatsuya’s was indeed the most temperate.

“Izumi, this guy is strong for a playboy.”

“Uh, umm, Kasumi-chan?”

Certainly, there was a clear difference between their mental states; although the probing looks they sent at him were the same, the flame of hostility was only burning in Kasumi’s pupils.

“Calming down a little would be…”

Izumi was gently stroking Kasumi.

“My intuition is screaming. This guy, he’s not ordinary.”

Nonetheless, Kasumi was not listening to her advice. She glared up at Tatsuya on her knees, shifting her left sleeve and exposing her CAD.

“Izumi, we’re doing that.”

As she said that, Kasumi ran her fingers down the console of her CAD. She was using magic without authorization. Clearly an illegal act. Moreover, for the second time. Even bearing in mind it was directed at himself, it was not something he could turn a blind eye to. She was a new student getting ready for the entrance ceremony, but having said that, there was no way he couldn’t arrest her.

In an instant, Tatsuya made that decision; fortunately, before he could act upon it, the illegal act of magic ended up being a mere attempt.

“Settle down!”

Mayumi, who had until then been too paralyzed to do anything about the situation, let her fist fall on top of Kasumi’s head.

“…”

Kasumi did not cry out but based on the way she held her head, despite how she was trying to make it appear, that probably really hurt.

“…Onee-chan, why did you do that?”

“That’s my line! Kasumi-chan, you, why did you do that!?”

Mayumi had both hands on her hips as she looked down at Kasumi, who was looking up at her sister’s face with teary eyes. She was really incensed. Right away, Kasumi’s agitated mind was cooled by her sister’s threatening attitude, the color of her face changing from red to white.

“I’ve told you over and over again, ‘The unauthorized use of magic is a crime!’ To do this on the very day you entered high school… What on earth were you thinking!?”

Tatsuya watched, completely dumbfounded, as Mayumi talked on and on in a voice that was half an octave higher than usual. Seeing her flustered was not an unfamiliar sight. Nevertheless, this was the first time he’d seen her in a frenzy. This honest straightforwardness was not something he could have imagined from her, so different was it from the usual enigmatic smiling façade she used to conceal her real intentions.

On the other hand, Kasumi, who was being drenched in the display of rage, had not abandoned her resistance, although she had curled herself up. Because they were family? Or could it possibly be because she was used to it.

“B-But, that guy was doing something indecent to Onee-chan…”

The counterattack was certainly effective.

“Wha… in-indecent!?”

She did do some damage to her opponent in a sense.

“We were not doing anything like that! What were you thinking!?”

If you looked at the big picture though, all she had done was add fuel to the fire.

“After all that you said about you two being fine looking around before the doors opened without me sticking with you like you two were children, Kasumi-chan, you did this!? You didn’t cause anyone else problems like you did just now, right!?”

I see, that was the reason, thought Tatsuya. Mayumi came here because she was escorting her sisters to the admissions ceremony instead of their busy parents.

“Onee-sama, that is absurd.”

The one who disputed the reprimand of Mayumi’s that had taken the form of a question was not Kasumi, whose body had begun quivering, but Izumi, who was snuggled next to her.

“Aside from Kasumi-chan’s mistake just now, we have not done anything to cause problems for other people.”

“I see… Izumi-chan, should I believe you?”

“I promise, there are no discrepancies.”

Izumi’s polite tone was a bit too polite as she proclaimed their innocence, which seemed to restore Mayumi’s equanimity somewhat.

“Understood. …Tatsuya-kun, please forgive us!”

After seeing the affirmative in Izumi’s eyes, Mayumi turned to Tatsuya and bowed deeply.

“My little sister did something outrageous. Kasumi-chan, you apologize to Tatsuya-kun as well!”

Perhaps she understood how serious her sister was; whatever she was feeling in her heart, Kasumi-chan wasn’t displaying that defiant manner any more.

“I cannot excuse my behavior.”

She lined up next to Mayumi and bravely lowered her head.

“I too offer my apologies. Shiba-senpai, please pardon Kasumi-chan’s rudeness somehow.”

Kasumi was not the only interested party; Izumi followed up after her elder sister.

Receiving a simultaneous apology from the three beautiful girls — no, one beautiful woman and two beautiful girls — made him feel ill at ease. Miraculously, there had been no witnesses to the use of power a little while ago, but now for some reason or other, he felt many suspicious gazes on them from here and there. If people mistakenly thought he was bullying the girls or something, then the damage of the aftermath would be worse than Kasumi’s flying knee kick.

“Please raise your heads. No harm has been done, so please don’t worry about it.”

Is what he said, but “please don’t do this for my sake” was closer to what Tatsuya meant. In order to escape from the gazes of the gradually increasing onlookers, he wanted to get away from this place as soon as possible. However, “don’t worry about it anymore” was not a pretense.

That was something Mayumi probably understood also. When she raised her head, she had a relieved look on her face. However, that look was soon replaced by a guilty one.

“Ah, umm, Tatsuya-kun.”

“What is it?”

In response to her mood, which was somewhat strange for some reason, Tatsuya put his mind on alert.

“I know that… the incident just now is supposed to be reported to the staff room, but,”

As she faced Tatsuya, Mayumi closed her eyes and put both her hands together.

“Please! For my sake, won’t you overlook this, please!?”

Oh, that’s it, Tatsuya did not mutter this out loud.

“I do not intend to make a big deal out of something as minor as this.”

Actually, if “something as minor as this” was a problem, he didn’t know how many times he and Miyuki would have been placed in protective custody. “I don’t want this talked about either” was Tatsuya’s honest feeling.

“Thank you, Tatsuya-kun!”

So, he was troubled by the abundance of emotion. Besides…

“No, she intended to barely miss me from the start.”

That flying knee kick had been what is known as a bluff. If she had been attacking him earnestly, Tatsuya wouldn’t have made such a gentle response.

Kasumi had planned for the combination Acceleration and Movement magic she had applied to herself to be caught by the other magic she linked to it when her knee was thirty centimeters from Tatsuya’s face, so rapid deceleration would be cast at the distance of ten centimeters when she would halt mid air. If she hadn’t done so, not even Tatsuya would have grasped her knee with one hand. No matter how much he had been trained, stopping a person who weighed forty kilograms and was accelerating at fifteen meters per second was impossible. Because he knew the point where the rapid deceleration started and the point where it was to halt, directly before the stopping point, he had literally forced termination by putting his hand there.

“Ha… I’ve come to expect that from you, Tatsuya-kun.”

As a look of astonishment and a mutter of “How the…” came from Kasumi on her side, Mayumi nodded yes-yes with an impressed look on her face. For Mayumi, abnormalities like this from Tatsuya had become a normal thing.

“Senpai, I have the job of new student guidance, so I must go. The event site is already open.”

To forestall Mayumi, who looked like she was going to say something unnecessary, Tatsuya made this announcement and quit the scene without waiting for a reply.

“Pixie.”

After separating from the Saegusa sisters, in a place where there were few people, Tatsuya put a vocal transmission unit near his mouth.

[Yes, Master.]

The voice that replied in a soft whisper was an active form of telepathy. This was the response of “Pixie” who was in the “3HType P-94”.

“Erase all the Psion sensor data from the records, from right now to ten minutes before now, for the area in front of the front yard entrance to the auditorium.”

[As you wish.]

It seemed that Mayumi had carelessly forgotten, but Kasumi’s use of magic without authorization could not be concealed merely by Tatsuya’s silence. Everywhere inside the school grounds was covered with sensors to observe magic activity; aside from the exception of periods like the new club member invitation week, the unauthorized use of magic would be recorded by the sensors.

[Erasure completed.]

Naturally, Tatsuya had not gotten Pixie moved to the Student Council room simply to wait on tables. Since she was originally a housekeeping robot, he had let her do what she wanted, but Tatsuya’s intention was entirely different. It was to hack the surveillance system inside the school.

If this was March, when Mayumi was still enrolled, then most of her usual requests would be accommodated. She had overcome the usual limits of the powers of the former Student Council presidents and retained the intervention codes for the surveillance system. Of course, she had not gotten them by honest means. Therefore, the Student Council president that followed her hadn’t inherited them, of course.

Tatsuya, who had various dark spots in his background, needed a means to intervene in the surveillance system other than Mayumi. Then he cast his eyes on how Pixie was constructed.

Right now, Pixie was operating from within the humanoid home helper robot’s electronic brain where her actual body was lodged, which she manipulated directly. In short, Pixie was concealing the ability to interface and seize electronic systems without an intermediary. This is what Tatsuya realized.

So Tatsuya spent most of spring break engrossed in teaching Pixie various hacking techniques. The techniques were ones he originally learned from the “Electron Sorceress” Fujibayashi. The fruit of Tatsuya’s labor was that within the limits of the First High School’s private system, Pixie had learned how to freely infiltrate the surveillance system and overwrite the data.




Although it was called new student guidance, it was not hard to figure out where the auditorium that was the site of the entrance ceremony was, and if you had a terminal equipped with an LPS (local positioning system) function, you couldn’t get lost. Cases like Erika’s last year where she didn’t have a terminal so she didn’t know where to go were the exception. Tatsuya and the others’ job was not to guide new students; their main job was to provide a heads up to new students who looked like they were going to be late.

“Umm, excuse me Senpai. Which way is it to the auditorium?”

Therefore Tatsuya had not expected to encounter a genuinely lost new student.

The place was the tree-lined path between the library and small second gymnasium. The site for the entrance ceremony was on the opposite side. The male new student, with a puzzled look on his face that he’d seen looking hither and thither, had just called out to him; now it was up to him to reply to this sentence.

Nevertheless, the new student was very ostentatious, thought Tatsuya. Although, there were some students in his own grade who possessed red hair, blue eyes, black skin or other colors that were unlike the majority of Japanese people. However, they were not as radiantly hued as the slight male student standing before him.

The color of his hair was platinum. The color of his eyes was silver. The color of his skin was white. It wasn’t just his coordinating colors. His facial features did not have any distinctive Japanese traits. Perhaps, his Nordic genes were expressed to a large extent. Come to think of it, Tatsuya perceived a resemblance to the new female teacher Sumisu (Smith).

“I’ll guide you. Come with me.”

Even though his mind was considering such things, Tatsuya did not delay giving an answer. As he said it, the new student bowed deeply with a relieved look.

“Thank you. Umm, I am Sumisu Kento.”

“Sumisu?”

Tatsuya muttered without thinking, because the surname of the person he had been thinking about resembled the family name of the boy. However, Smith was one of the common names in English speaking countries. It could be a coincidence, reconsidered Tatsuya.

“Ah, yes, it is written with ‘sumi,’ the symbol in ‘corner,’ and ‘su,’ the symbol in ‘counterattack,’ and read as Sumisu. My parents emigrated from the States before I was born. At that time, Smith started being spelled with the symbols as Sumisu… is it a weird name?”

However, the boy Kento took it to mean that he was talking about the strangeness of the name. The way he tapered off toward the end might mean he had experienced teasing in elementary and middle school over having Sumisu as a surname.

“No, I did not think it weird, even a bit.”

Middle school and elementary students might practice what is called innocent and thoughtless cruelty. But Tatsuya would have nothing to do with foolishness like that. What he was considering was that if both his parents were immigrants, then it was natural that he couldn’t see any physical traits that were distinctively Japanese.

“By the way.”

More importantly, there was something else bothering Tatsuya.

“Sumisu-kun, doesn’t your information terminal have an LPS function?”

When Tatsuya spotted the boy, he had been looking at both screens of his information terminal nearly in tears. If his information terminal was equipped with an LPS function then he should not be lost.

“Ah, please call me Kento. About the LPS… the function is attached, but,”

As he was speaking, Kento retrieved his rather large information terminal from his pocket. His height wasn’t even up to Tatsuya’s chest. One of his inherited traits must be having an extremely small stature. Height-wise, he would be classified with the shorter Japanese males of his own age. So perhaps because he thought it would be hard to see if he merely held it in his hand, he held it above his head when he pointed it toward Tatsuya.

The information terminal was an extremely old model. Tatsuya couldn’t determine anything about it other than that it was old, but the model was at least twenty years old. And it wasn’t a domestic brand. A type that had been constructed in the USNA and fairly common.

“I didn’t have anything but a visual model terminal, so my father lent me the information terminal he used to use, but… it doesn’t have standard LPS.”

I see, thought Tatsuya. Since it was designed for an earlier version of the public infrastructure, it has low compatibility with the current version — no, that would be limited to domestic models.

Japan and the USNA process data by subtly different methods. Besides the USNA’s LPS is at most a supplement of their GPS system, it is not an independent function like Japan’s LPS.

“Let me see it.”

Tatsuya reflexively checked the processing power and unused capacity of the terminal Kento handed him. It was an old model, but it had undergone various tune ups. Kento’s father might be an electrical engineer. Deciding that it would be fine, Tatsuya linked Kento’s terminal directly to his own by a wire and transferred the local position application.

“I’ve installed a school map that uses GPS. It is lower in speed than an LPS application, but it should serve you as a map guide.”

He returned the terminal to Kento after the installation was completed.

“Thank you!”

Despite the fact that that was all he did, Kento looked at Tatsuya as if he had saved his life.

“Of course, it would be better to buy a replacement. After all, this is only a temporary fix.”

He was giving out advice that did not need to be said because behind his poker face, Tatsuya was a little taken aback. He soon found out the reason for Kento’s excessive response.

“Uh, umm, are you Shiba Tatsuya-senpai!?”

“Oh, that’s true, you know of me?”

“Yes! I saw your activities in last years Nine Schools Competition!”

Tatsuya was not surprised at Kento’s answer. Although it was in the Newcomers Division, he had played a leading role in the Monolith Code matches. On occasion, someone should probably remember his face from that.

That was what Tatsuya thought, but,

“Your tactics were incredible! Your tune ups were brilliant! I chose First High School because you would be my senpai here!”

He had been half right. Kento hadn’t recognized him as an athlete but as an engineer.

“Until I saw last year’s Nine Schools Competition, I intended to enroll in Fourth High School. Because, my practical skills are poor. But when I saw Senpai’s super technical skills, I decided that I absolutely had to go to the same school as Senpai!”

Listening to Kento’s enthusiastic words made Tatsuya feel like he was hearing someone else being talked about.

“Right now, I am as you can see a Second Course student, but I’m determined to try to transfer into the same Magic Engineering Course as you Senpai, next year!”

“…I see; work hard. With such enthusiasm, you should be alright.”

“Thank you!”

His interests were in a little different direction, but he was probably a male version of Honoka. Tatsuya was a little confused by the enthusiastic puppy dog eyes Kento used to stare at him.




Kasumi and Izumi parted from Mayumi at the entrance to the auditorium and selected seats in a row close to the front. Kasumi took her seat first, but she didn’t wait for Izumi to finish sitting down in her polite and elegant manner before turning to face her.

“Izumi, do you know that skirt-chasing boy from earlier?”

There were still twenty minutes until the entrance ceremony began. There were many new students who were chatting with their neighbors like the girls. In their midst, Izumi’s posture said “what’s up” when her elder sister, who was the same age as herself, deliberately whispered to her, but she looked like she lost interest when she understood the meaning of Kasumi’s question.

“Yes. …Could it be that you really didn’t recognize him, Kasumi-chan?”

When Kasumi’s face told her that Kasumi was asking the question in earnest, Izumi looked stunned.

“…Is he a famous person?”

“In a sense, he is.”

Izumi sighed softly and moved her hips so she could sit facing Kasumi.

“His name is Shiba Tatsuya-senpai. Last year, he was in the Second Course, but this year he transferred into the Magic Engineering Course.”

“Hmm… He transferred to the Magic Engineering Course from the Second Course so he’s smart.”

It wasn’t that she was impressed, but she wasn’t making light of it either; this weak response from Kasumi made Izumi’s eyes say “This is so annoying…”

“What?”

“It’s nothing; certainly, he is smart, but… Is it really right to assign him such a common label?”

Izumi deliberately put her hand to her cheek and posed as if confused. Her attitude made Kasumi petulant, but Kasumi knew letting Izumi get you irritated only made it easier for Izumi to manipulate you. With these twins, who had been together since they had been born, their “inclinations and countermeasures” were exactly the same. Kasumi silently waited for Izumi to continue her comments.

“When he was a First Year — moreover a Second Course student — he participated in last year’s Nine Schools Competition as an engineer. The athletes he was responsible for in the Newcomer’s Division Girls’ Speed Shooting and Icicle Destruction monopolized first to third place, took first and second place in the Newcomer’s Division Mirage Bat, and took first place in the Main Division’s Mirage Bat.”

“No way… that means that the athletes in his care only lost to each other, so they were effectively invincible?”

“Yes.”

“You’re kidding…?”

“It’s not a lie or a joke. That senpai produced the miraculous results as an engineer leading to the athletes in his charge to be called truly invincible.”

While Izumi was in the middle of answering her question, Kasumi deliberately looked for signs that her leg was being pulled so she fixedly examined her younger twin’s face. However, apparently Izumi was answering her seriously and what she was told next caused her to open her eyes even wider.

“He was employed as support staff in Onee-sama’s Crowd Ball. Kasumi-chan, you were really unaware of this?”

Izumi had already lost her stunned look; rather, she was hitting Kasumi with a pitying look.

“I was completely unaware…”

“He was an emergency replacement, but Onee-sama didn’t look hindered in any way.”

Kasumi had a stricken look and was at a loss for words. Kasumi and Izumi had watched Mayumi’s matches in last summer’s Nine Schools competition together. In spite of that, she herself hadn’t been aware of the existence of any would-be Casanovas cozying up to her elder sister, and only Izumi being aware of it gave her a shock.

“But I don’t like it.”

Izumi absentmindedly muttered while Kasumi was in a befuddled state.

“Onee-sama is letting her guard pretty far down around Shiba-senpai… He might ambush her when she least expects it.”

This was all she said out loud. After her forceful monologue, Izumi sank into pensiveness while next to her, Kasumi still hadn’t gotten over her shock.




The entrance ceremony ended as planned without accidents. Takuma’s speech had also ended without any special problems. All the eyes in the auditorium were not glued on him like the year before; like the year before last year, the students were too excited by being enrolled to pay much attention to it, an easy speech.

Afterwards was the traditional invitation to join the Student Council. The unwritten rule was that the discussion would take place after the admissions ceremony was over. Not for the reason that until the admissions ceremony was over, they weren’t really students. It feels a little too formalized, but until now, there hadn’t been any trouble with it. Despite the slight turmoil last year, none of the invitations had been refused up to now. However—

“I am sorry, but please accept my refusal.”

This was Takuma’s answer to Azusa’s “Won’t you please join the Student Council” invitation.

“…Is it alright to ask for a reason?”

Instead of Azusa, who was transfixed by the completely unexpected no, Isori, who was the only person who accompanied her, made the inquiry.

“I wish to devote all my attention to improving myself.”

While staring back at Isori, looking directly into his eyes, Takuma answered thus.

“I want to be as strong as any Magician in the Ten Master Clans. That is my goal. So for extracurricular activities, instead of organizational management in the Student Council, I wish to devote myself to club activities.”

The unhesitating reply had probably been prepared beforehand. In short, his decision was that firm. Persuading him would be difficult, thought Isori.

“I see…”

The owner of that despondent sounding voice was not Isori, but Azusa. Azusa had been released from her paralysis unexpectedly fast, but as she sighed, she feebly hung her head down. She had probably been quite shocked. At least, Isori thought so when he looked at her from the side.

“If that’s how it is, then we can’t force you to do it.”

However, astonishingly, Azusa readily accepted Takuma’s words.

“It is unfortunate for us, but if that is what you decided, Shippou-kun, please work hard at your club activities.”

Her all too quick surrender was completely outside of Takuma’s predictions. However, if he lingered here, the Student Council officers might think he had misgivings. Perhaps they might think he was counting on them to restrain him and believe he was only faking his refusal, this was what Takuma thought.

“Excuse me. I’m leaving.”

The thought that there was a very high possibility that he might be “over-thinking things” hurried him up, and Takuma left Azusa’s presence very quickly.

While the pair of third years, Azusa and Isori, tried hard (and failed) to get Takuma to join the Student Council, the three second years, Tatsuya, Miyuki and Honoka, were also very busy.

Honoka was in charge of putting things in order after the admissions ceremony. Checking the presence or absence of the main guests, sorting congratulatory addresses, and so on, the delivery of the photographic data to the vendor and other things all had to be confirmed.

Tatsuya was in charge of giving directions to the second years who had been recruited to help. No one raised sullen protests over being ordered by Tatsuya, who was in the Second Course last year and was now wearing the eight petal gear emblem. He was reclaiming the armbands, headsets and other stuff now that their tasks were done.

And, as for Miyuki,

“My only regret about this year’s admissions ceremony is that I didn’t hear a speech from Shiba-kun.”

“That would be impossible, Kouzuke-sensei. The only students who go up on the stage during the admissions ceremony are the Student Council president and the freshmen representative, after all.”

“Hahaha, now that you mentioned it, that’s right.”

…She was surrounded by adults who made something over nothing, like this one, with a determinedly amiable smile on her face.

The profession of the man in the prime of life she called “Kouzuke-sensei” was politician. As a member of the National Diet attached to the ruling political party based in Tokyo, if his party won the next election, then he was a young man with good prospects of securing a cabinet minister’s post. He was known as a parliamentary member favorable to Magicians and he was also working as a supervisor on the non-school matters of the Magic University. In the present circumstances, when the forces hostile to magicians were gradually gaining influence, he was not a person either the Magic University or First High School could ignore.

Miyuki was well aware of this as well. That was why she had been putting up with his small talk with an amiable smile for a while now. Actually, this was not something a sixteen year old girl should be concerned with, but Miyuki was patiently enduring it. In the eyes of Congressman Kouzuke, specks of sexual awareness flickered. It was not strong enough to be linked to actual deed; men who were conscious of their waning physicality seem to instinctively long to embrace young beautiful women. However, even if it was only in his mind (it was not platonic), being eyed like that unmistakably makes a young girl feel unclean. Nonetheless, Miyuki endured that rude stare while pretending not to notice.

His long-windedness would become a problem for the staff soon. As long as a public official with his exalted status — even among the other VIPs — remained at the site, the staff couldn’t leave the site either.

Actually, last year he wasn’t this long winded. However, he hadn’t suddenly decided he liked to make small talk this year. Last year and the year before, he had showed restraint due to Mayumi.

Not Mayumi as an individual, but to the name of Saegusa of the Ten Master Clans.

Congressman Kouzuke did not display friendliness to Magicians out of goodwill or a liking for them. He probably did “like” Magicians, but what he liked were the advantages for his political activities he as a politician got from being an advocate for Magicians. Kouzuke and the Magicians were bound in a profitable relationship; for that reason, he showed deference when faced with the Ten Master Clans, who had exalted status among the Magicians.

If Miyuki’s relationship with the Yotsuba had been obvious, Kouzuke would have made a stiff smile and quickly left the site. The Yotsuba name had even more impact than the Saegusa name. The political utility of the Saegusa name was higher, but the Yotsuba name incited much more fear in people with influence.

However, the “family name” Miyuki was allowed to claim was “Shiba,” not “Yotsuba”. Besides, no matter how close she was to the limit of her patience, this was far too trivial a matter to rely on the power of the Yotsuba to resolve it. For her, the Yotsuba were not allies she could rely on unconditionally.

The one who saved Miyuki, who had almost no more ability to cope with her annoyance and irritation, was not a Yotsuba, but a Saegusa.

“Hello, Kouzuke-sensei.”

Kouzuke turned his head toward the voice that suddenly called his name and the instant he registered the sight of Mayumi, clothed in her feminine suit and womanly smile, his face stiffened.

“You have graced us with your presence again this year. Thank you for always taking the time when you are so busy.”

“Because this is an important day for the talented youths who must shoulder the burden of this nation’s future. I believe it is more of an honor that I receive an invitation to this event every year.”

In the presence of Mayumi, with her overly formal attitude and who spoke to him in a polite tone, Kouzuke quickly got the urge to flee. If he had been incapable of reading between the lines when Mayumi put an unnatural emphasis on “so busy”, then he wouldn’t have become a candidate to become a Cabinet Minister in the government. Although insensitivity was pardonable, a politician couldn’t function well if he was stupid.

“More importantly, why are you here Mayumi-kun? Are you escorting your sisters?”

Kouzuke asked that as he looked toward Kasumi and Izumi, who remained behind Mayumi. As he prepared to make his retreat, he offered a proper comment to ensure he didn’t appear abnormal.

“Yes, because both our parents unfeelingly said that they couldn’t take the time to do it right now.”

“Hahaha, both of them are such busy people.”

Kouzuke’s amiable smile was a bit stiff.

“Kasumi-chan, Izumi-chan, say hello.”

Without trying to make any more witticism, Mayumi looked back at her sisters.

“Kouzuke-sensei, we haven’t seen you in so long.”

“It has really been a long time hasn’t it; there is no excuse for it.”

The pair who had been silently holding back until addressed made their bows; Kasumi energetically, Izumi elegantly. Their stereotypical greetings offered Kouzuke a good opportunity.

“My, my, both of you have been busy studying for exams, right, so you should not be bothered by such a thing. Please do well in high school.”

“Thank you, sensei.”

“We will put all our efforts into it.”

As Kasumi and Izumi once again lowered their heads, a pause in the atmosphere was created. Kouzuke did not miss this change.

“I expect great things from you two. And so, Mayumi-kun, it is about time for me to take my leave.”



And with this simple goodbye, Kouzuke departed from that place.

Mayumi did not chase after his back as he left.

“Are you alright, Miyuki-san?”

“Yes. Thank you, Saegusa-senpai.”

Mayumi spoke to her with a cheerful smile which Miyuki answered with a humble smile. This place still had the attention of the school staff. An all too clear display of sympathy would only cause them problems from Congressman Kouzuke.

For that reason, Miyuki had deliberately not given out any sign that would cause the school staff to show active concern. She hadn’t been only behaving as if she wasn’t really being taken advantage of. As long as it would not entangle Tatsuya, she wove a thin protective barrier on her skin of poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide (Product name- Kevlar).

Noticing that her bare face was underneath a see-through mask stronger than steel was difficult unless you had extremely discerning eyes. And there was no possibility of it being done by a high school girl that had just met her. Even if you were a direct descendant of the Ten Master Clans and were used to watching foxes and raccoons. Most people would undoubtedly only be able to see Miyuki’s reserved expression as part of her embodiment as the ideal, refined, willowy, graceful Yamato Nadeshiko[3].

“Izumi-chan.”

At least, that is how Izumi saw her. Izumi, who was in a daze, her mind and eyes stolen by Miyuki,

“Izumi, Izumi.”

“Umm?”

When Kasumi, who was next to her, poked her knee, she finally became aware that Mayumi was talking to her.

“More than ‘umm’ is needed, right. Give Miyuki-san a proper hello.”

Her eldest sister’s words permeating her consciousness, a flustered Izumi directed her eyes forward. Before Izumi’s eyes, Miyuki smiled gently with a slightly confused look on her face.

(Like a goddess…)

Of course, Izumi had not encountered an existence that could be called a “goddess.” The words just naturally drifted into her mind as to how to describe the sight of Miyuki as reflected in the eyes of Izumi, who had separated from reality. As for calling her a beautiful girl, her eldest sister Mayumi was undisputedly in that caste, and although a stranger might think it narcissistic, Izumi thought Kasumi was pretty cute as well. However, this was the first time she had seen beauty at the level of the upperclassman with the ethereal smile, Izumi felt. Miyuki fit the imagined ideal of what Izumi “wanted to become”.

“…Saegusa Izumi. Ah, would it be alright if I called you Miyuki-senpai?”

“Yes, I wouldn’t mind.”

Izumi’s eyes were blurry with zeal, and her voice was a little thin. What has come over her so suddenly, thought Mayumi and Kasumi uneasily, aware of her abnormality, but Miyuki nodded without breaking her smile.

“Miyuki-senpai, I was so impressed by your efforts in the Nine Schools Competition. You were so splendid.”

“Thank you.”

Miyuki accepted Izumi’s feverish gaze with the ease of an upperclassman.

“However, it is even more impressive to see you in person than it was to see you from the stands… You’re so pretty.”

“Uh, oh really?”

However, as the feverish gaze transcended admiration and started to be tinged with insanity, Miyuki naturally started wanting to withdraw.





“To attend the same institution as Miyuki-senpai… I am so thrilled.”

“Izumi-chan, what in the world are you saying?”

Watching Izumi, who usually concealed her thoughts and feelings behind an unreadable, gentle smile, let her emotions run wild was enough to incite panic in Mayumi. Kasumi was already well aware of her younger twin’s tendency to spout zealous words, so she merely watched with a stunned look.

“Miyuki-senpai… Won’t you become my Onee-sama?”

“Onee-sama!?”

“Hey, Izumi-chan! Calm down! Your Onee-chan is me!”

Both Miyuki and Mayumi were raising their voices. Izumi, who was the main instigator of the creation of this strange sight, was fixedly staring at Miyuki. Kasumi, who was next to her, frowned and turned away pretending that she didn’t know them.

“I believe it would be impossible for you to become Miyuki-neesama’s younger sister, Saegusa-san.”

The one who threw a stone into this chaotic stalemated situation was Minami, who had been standing there eavesdropping near the four of them for a little while now.

“Minami-chan?”

Miyuki, who hadn’t been aware that Minami had been waiting for her, intentionally put the implied question of “How long have you been here?” into the name she spoke; Minami postponed answering that question with her reply.

“But there is a possibility of becoming Tatsuya-niisama’s sister-in-law. If Saegusa-san’s Onee-sama married Tatsuya-niisama, then Saegusa-san would become Tatsuya-niisama’s younger sister.”

After she had finished giving her supplementary explanation to Izumi, she pivoted, turning to a person behind her.

“In this case, Tatsuya-niisama’s actual younger sister, Miyuki-neesama, and Tatsuya-niisama’s sister-in-law, Saegusa-san, could be called sisters, right?”

“Onii-sama!?”

The person Minami was directing her question to was, as Miyuki’s raised voice indicated, Tatsuya.

“I am totally against it!”

However, Tatsuya could not answer Minami’s question or respond to Miyuki’s words. Because faster than he could open his mouth, Kasumi yelled an objection.

“I am absolutely against Onee-chan becoming Shiba-senpai’s bride or anything like that!”

Kasumi, who had up until that point persisted in being a mere spectator, suddenly interposed herself between Tatsuya and Mayumi’s line of sight; her back was to Mayumi as if she was trying to protect her as she confronted Tatsuya. Her meekness of a little while ago went some place else and she fully unleashed a “don’t get close to Onee-chan” aura.

“Kasumi-chan, she was only speaking hypothetically…”

Because they were twins, they had sort of assigned roles; with Kasumi and Izumi, if one of them went into a frenzy, the other one’s job was apparently to return that one to normal. Izumi, who had up until now been crushing on Miyuki, was suddenly serene and began to soothe Kasumi.

Mayumi applied pressure to her temples as she watched the pair. This was not just a pose, it seemed she really had a headache.

“Tatsuya-kun.”

With her head cast down and her hand on her forehead, Mayumi called Tatsuya’s name. Tatsuya tried to get nearer to her so that he would be at a distance at which they could hold a normal conversation; Kasumi stood glaring at him intimidatingly before him, blocking his way.

However, in the next instant.

“Fugya-!”

Kasumi raised a scream like a cat whose tail got stepped on and immediately held her head, cowering.

“Miyuki-san.”

Behind Kasumi, Mayumi had swung her fist downward, her eyes still looking at the floor. The voice that sprung from her showed she was miserable all the way to her core.

“For my stupid sisters… I’m really sorry.”

What could be seen of Mayumi’s face as she was hanging her head was extremely red. She was probably really embarrassed. It wasn’t as if that was something Tatsuya couldn’t understand. Standing there all that time, her sisters going off the rails, even he probably wouldn’t have been able to endure it any longer.

“Don’t let it bother you. Right, Miyuki?”

“Yes. Senpai, please don’t worry about it.”

Tatsuya directed Miyuki to gloss this over, so Miyuki also cheerfully shook her head. Despite Izumi’s disgraceful behavior and Kasumi’s running amok, treating Tatsuya as a skirt chaser, Miyuki was in high spirits for some reason. Miyuki’s attitude made Mayumi feel suspicious and uneasy, but right now she couldn’t indulge in the luxury of pursuing the matter.

“I will surely make it up to you. —You two, we’re leaving right now.”

“Oooh! It hurts, Onee-chan!”

“Onee-sama, you’re hurting me! Why are you treating me like this too?”

A hand on the nape of the neck of each twin, Mayumi departed like she was making an escape.




On the route used to commute from the school entrance to the “First High School” station, turning one corner takes one to the coffee shop “Eine Brise” that Tatsuya and his friends like. Today also, on Tatsuya’s way back from the ceremony, with a coffee in one hand, he was enjoying a chat in the café with Miyuki, Minami, Honoka, Shizuku, and Mikihiko.

After separating from the Saegusa sisters, Tatsuya and Miyuki had linked up with Azusa temporarily. However, Azusa had emphatically told them that it was alright to leave, so they came here on the way home with Honoka and the rest.

“Come to think of it, how did the invitation to the freshmen representative go?”

When Shizuku asked that, she unintentionally silenced the conversation. She hadn’t meant anything by it — she hadn’t asked the question out of gossipy curiosity. She was unprepared for the silence that her words caused.

“…He refused.”

So when she was faced with the black cloud she suddenly cast over the table and the thoroughly crushed Honoka, Shizuku tasted bitter regret and wished she hadn’t asked that question.

“Eh, Shippou-kun declined to join the Student Council?”

So Mikihiko’s words, which gave his own curiosity precedence, could be called a fine move to get rid of the oppressive ambience.

“The person himself seems to have said he wants to devote himself to club activities. Nothing can be done if he has other things he wants to do.”

Tatsuya’s answer seemed to be more of a “don’t worry about it” to Honoka than an answer to Mikihiko’s question.

“Yes. We can’t coerce him.”

Because he read Tatsuya or by mere chance, Mikihiko’s follow up remark revived the mood enough that Honoka looked up and stopped looking so defeated.

“So it would be more productive to consider who to invite to join the Student Council instead of Shippou-kun.”

Taking her cue from Tatsuya, Miyuki drew their friends completely away from the topic of Takuma.

“That’s true. If you think of the consequences of a freshman not joining the Student Council, this is a bad situation.”

Tatsuya nodded soberly and Miyuki lightly clapped her hands.

“I know. How about Minami-chan becoming a member of the Student Council?”

Minami, who until then has just been silently listening to the upperclassman talk, stiffened at Miyuki’s suggestion.

“Miyuki, that’s a little rough on Minami-chan.”

However, faster than Minami could open her mouth, Tatsuya rejected Miyuki’s idea.

“Because there is a tradition to the way the Student Council chooses successors, the substitute candidate must also be chosen by their score on the entrance exam.”

Minami looked relieved. On the other hand, Miyuki did not look the least bit upset over the plan being rejected — she was smiling. Miyuki probably wasn’t serious about having Minami join the Student Council; she was probably only teasing her a little.

“Who was the runner-up?”

Shizuku didn’t bother speculating on Miyuki’s state of mind and in response to Tatsuya, questioned Honoka, who as student council secretary had access to the exam results.

“Umm, Saegusa Izumi-san. Saegusa senpai’s sister.”

Honoka did not check her terminal; she had the exam results properly memorized.

“Third place is also Saegusa senpai’s sister, Kasumi-chan. There’s only a narrow margin between Shippou’s first place and the pair’s second and third. There’s a huge gap between these three and fourth place”

Miyuki, who also knew the exam results like Honoka, offered supplemental information to Shizuku.

“So it wouldn’t be strange if either of Saegusa-senpai’s sisters became a Student Council officer?”

Mikihiko as usual spoke more formally to Miyuki.

“But going by the order, wouldn’t it be Izumi-san?”

Mikihiko’s attitude could be seen as suspicious or amusing, but Shizuku indifferently ignored it and made her objection.

Miyuki’s face looked a little sour at Shizuku’s words. The incident a little while ago had probably made her aware that she would not deal well with Izumi.

“The president will decide, but the first prerequisite is probably willingness.”

Tatsuya also noticed the change in Miyuki’s expression, but out of consideration for her privacy pretended like he might not be aware of it.

Mikihiko entered the room as Tatsuya was washing his hands in the restroom. There was no special significance to this. Their timing had probably overlapped by chance, thought Tatsuya as he prepared to leave.

“Tatsuya.”

However, Mikihiko called out to stop him in a low gloomy voice.

“What? …Do you have something you don’t want to talk about with the others there?”

“Yes… it’s not something I want generally known?”

“Understood. I won’t talk about it with the others.”

Tatsuya’s words relieved Mikihiko, who was a little stiff with indecision.

“Tatsuya, it would help to keep the conversation short.”

“Since staying in here too long would be thought weird, I’m the one who has to ask Mikihiko to keep it short.”

As Tatsuya said, they couldn’t stay in here too long without someone becoming suspicious of their health. With that urging, Mikihiko rapidly opened up.

“Tatsuya, do you know if the new manager of Rozen’s Japanese branch came to today’s ceremony?”

It doesn’t need saying that by Rozen, he meant “Rozen Magicraft” which was a German magic technology company that was battling with “Maximilian Devices” to become the top maker of CADs in the world. The manager of their Japanese branch would be a major important figure to the National Magic University as well as the magic high schools.

“I know. I managed to get by with a brief greeting.”

Naturally, Tatsuya had known he had been invited and confirmed his attendance.

“Only briefly? At the after party for last year’s Nine Schools Competition, the previous branch manager seemed to be quite interested in you.”

“I was lucky today, because I didn’t have time for that.”

Tatsuya looked sour as he recalled that gloomy summer memory.

“So, what about the new Rozen branch manager?”

However, he soon returned to his “it doesn’t matter” look and urged Mikihiko to continue.

“Do you remember the new branch manager’s name?”

“Ernst Rozen, he seems to be a member of the Rozen’s main family.”

“That right. He’s a bigwig — the trade journals were making much of it.”

For an instant, the words were stuck in Mikihiko’s throat, but he immediately threw off his hesitation and whispered in a low slightly desperate tone.

“And he is a cousin of Erika’s mother.”

Tatsuya’s poker face didn’t survive this explosive revelation.

“Erika’s mother was a relative’s of the Rozen?”

Both of his eyes showed surprise as Tatsuya asked that question. Mikihiko made a small but distinct nod to his request for confirmation of the information.

“It seems that Erika’s mother’s father eloped with a Japanese woman.”

“Eloped, that’s an old fashioned word.”

“Well…”

Mikihiko smiled somewhat wryly at the surprise Tatsuya displayed at something that was off-topic. The somewhat complicated atmosphere cleared a little. As Mikihiko continued, his face looked as if his shoulders were less stiff.

“Because he shook off his parents’ opposition and fled to Japan, they had severed ties with the main Rozen family. Her grandmother’s — Erika’s mother’s mother’s family — also apparently didn’t approve of the couple’s relationship, so it seems like Erika’s mother had a tough time.”

“It’s a sad story, but what of it?”

Tatsuya thought it was a bad family situation, but Mikihiko’s purpose wasn’t to garner sympathy for Erika. Tatsuya was urging Mikihiko to get on to his main topic.

“…Since that incident, the Rozen main family doesn’t have a good impression of Japan. Even though they have trade bases in Japan, none of the main family have been on the registry in the Japanese branch offices.”

“Come to think of it, that’s right.”

As Mikihiko spoke, Tatsuya went through the registry of executives for the last ten years for Rozen Magicraft Japanese branch offices. Certainly, there were no Rozens listed.

“I may be over-thinking things, but… I feel that Ernst Rozen’s trip to Japan has something to do with Erika.”

Tatsuya also thought he might be over-thinking things. However, he was more concerned with why Mikihiko was telling him this.

“And what do you want me to do about this?”

“I don’t actually have anything I want you to do. However, I wanted to share my concerns.”

Faced with Tatsuya’s suspicious eyes, Mikihiko smiled wryly to himself.

“No, it’s not that… I involved Tatsuya because it was a little too heavy to keep to myself.”

Mikihiko whispered in a self-deprecating way.

“It’s a pitiful tale.”

Tatsuya did not show any signs of evasion when he spoke his frank impression in front of Mikihiko.




After Tatsuya left, Azusa remained in the Student Council room alone until just before the gate closed (Pixie was in suspended mode). Even though the admissions ceremony was over, there was still a huge pile of “start of the new school year” work for the Student Council. So it wasn’t strange for Student Council President Azusa to stay this late. If something could be called strange, it was the fact that the other Student Council members had left before her.

This wasn’t because Azusa had wanted to do the work of five people by herself. Until a little while ago, she had merely been blankly staring at this month’s schedule. Sometimes she sighed deeply, and shook her head “no-no”. Those were the only times she turned to the terminal with a determined face and immediately relapsed to wasting time looking blankly at the monitor. For some time now, she had been repeating this behavior.

After who knows how many sighs, a change finally arrived. The electronic chime and the message display announcing the visitor’s arrival notified her simultaneously. The screensaver on the camera was replaced by the image of Hattori. Azusa hurriedly manipulated the terminal and opened the door with a key.

“Pardon me. Nakajou… What? Are you alone?”

“Ah, yes. I wanted to ponder something alone for a while.”

As she spoke, she conscientiously stood up and directed Hattori to take a seat.

After conscientiously bowing, Hattori sat in the chair she had offered.

“If you used your ID, Hattori-kun, you could have come in even without me using the key to open the door.”

While saying that in a dejected tone, Azusa started to get the tea but Hattori stopped her with a gesture.

“I am no longer an officer of the Student Council. So, I must act like it.”

“That’s so like you, Hattori-kun.”

Azusa chuckled a little and then returned to her own seat. She was a little surprised, but Hattori-kun was one of the few male students Azusa could talk to normally without using formal language.

“So what is it?”

“This year’s freshmen representative.”

Undoubtedly, one of Hattori’s merits was that he didn’t bother with any lighthearted phrases like “I came to see your face” or “is it alright to come without an errand”.

However, this was also a trait that could undoubtedly be called a little too straightforward and lacking in tact.

“Shippou-kun…?”

Looking at the forced smile on Azusa’s face, Hattori thought “aw nuts,” but regrets are always too late. Beside, choosing to halt this conversation at this point wasn’t part of his style.

“Ah… Shippou refused the student council’s invitation, right?”

Azusa was well aware of this inflexible, over serious nature of Hattori. So she wasn’t outraged or hurt about something of this level.

“Yes. He wants to improve himself with club activities.”

“That seems to be the case. So, you decided to accept his prepared explanation, Nakajou?”

Hattori felt that being too worried about others’ feelings was a bit rude, so he didn’t mumble his question.

“Uh, did what?”

“Like the Student Council, Club Management needs to train an executive candidate chosen from among the freshmen. You are well aware of the need to fill Juumonji-senpai’s place.”

“People like Juumonji-senpai are exceptions among exceptions. I think Hattori-kun is doing fine, but…”

Hattori made a wry smile at Azusa’s attempt to comfort him. There was no listlessness or self-deprecation leaking through that expression. Apparently Hattori wasn’t depressed for any reason, which relieved Azusa.

“I too understand that he is an exception. And so it is necessary that I raise a leader sooner rather than later.”

After listening to all he said so far, Azusa realized what he came here to talk about.

“Are you going to promote Shippou-kun to a candidate for successor?”

“Ah. Unfortunately, it will appear as if we snatched him from the student council, but…”

“It was after he already refused us, so I don’t think you snatched him.”

“Oh really. That’s a relief.”

Azusa smiled as she waved her hand; Hattori bowed in response.

“I said not to worry about it. Shippou-kun was already set on refusing us from the start and… Oh yes!”

As she spoke, Azusa intentionally made a show of cheerfully clapping her hands together.

“Since you’re already here, can I hear your opinion on something, Hattori-kun?”

“Opinion? My opinion on what?”

Azusa did not immediately answer Hattori’s questions. She set the image shown on her personal computer to be displayed on the surface of the wall.

“The new student data?”

The freshmen’s scores on the entrance exam by subject were included in their personal data.

“Shippou-kun ran away, but I think it would be very bad if a freshman didn’t join the Student Council.”

“So you have been worrying over who to invite to join instead of Shippou-kun?”

This was the exact same thing Tatsuya and his friends were talking about at Eine Brise. Worrying about the same thing in different places is clearly a futile thing but as is clear from the bird’s eye view of the two events, it was happening. Unmistakably, these type of overlapping events happen in the world.

“Yes, I am. I think any of them would be excellent…”

Azusa paused as she said that with a troubled look on her face but,

“It’s not something you need to ponder so hard is it?”

Hattori dealt with the topic easily.

“If the top scorer refused the invitation, it’s okay to choose the runner-up. The runner-up this year…”

However, as he went through the lineup of new students based on their exam results, Hattori cut off his words and his face stiffened.

“As I thought, one of Saegusa-senpai’s sisters would be okay… Hattori-kun, what’s wrong? You look pale?”

“No, it’s nothing. Oh, yes, I think that would be best as well.”

Hattori stood up as he spoke, made a hurried goodbye and left the Student Council room.

“Hattori-kun, what could have happened…?”

Azusa muttered that as she watched him leave. The reason Hattori’s face had stiffened was unknown.




AD 2096, April 10th. For the freshmen, this was the noon break of their third day.

Tatsuya faced Kasumi and Izumi in the Student Council room. Even though it was put that way, he was not the only one facing them because he was seated with his fellow Student Council officers.

He was hit with a sense of déjà vu over the situation. Spring of last year, on the same third day of school, Tatsuya had been called to this room. Of course, he was not the only one who had been invited and he had not been the main guest. His role had been nothing more than a supplement to Miyuki. Due to some kind of error, he had been pressured to take up the mantle of a member of the Public Morals Committee.

Since that event, big unimaginable changes had been forced on his high school life. If he had not come to this room on that day, Tatsuya would probably be enjoying a peaceful high school life. At least, he himself thought so.

—People other than himself would have some doubts about agreeing with him on that.

The one who had invited Miyuki and Tatsuya at that time was Mayumi. And now, Tatsuya had become a member of the Student Council that had invited Mayumi’s sisters. Maybe this is karma, was Tatsuya’s slightly disjointed thought.

“So you wish to promote one of us to the position of Student Council officer, is that what you are saying?”

Tatsuya’s mind was drawn back to this place by Izumi’s words that touched on the main topic. Right across from him, Kasumi was glaring at Tatsuya as usual with eyes that seemed to growl. That was the reason Tatsuya has taken a break from reality.

“To be able to work together with Miyuki-senpai… it’s like a dream.”

He couldn’t tell what Miyuki was thinking behind her iron wall of an amiable smile looking at Izumi, who had a hand on her cheek directly across from her. Kasumi, who was open in her hostility, and Izumi, who was open with her desires. Azusa, Isori, and Honoka were completely overwhelmed by the pair’s strange attitudes. As a result, the roles of interacting with the pair fell to the targets of their hostility and lust, Tatsuya and Miyuki.

“If you wish, there is no problem with both of you working together.”

He felt that there was something wrong with leaving the job of interacting with them to their targets, but he couldn’t let his sister bear the full brunt of it alone. With that in mind, Tatsuya returned to the table. However,

“I have no intention of joining the Student Council.”

His effort only elicited a brusque response from Kasumi. The way she phrased her answer showed her strong determination to reject Tatsuya. And the fact that her speech pattern was slightly different from how she spoke to her sisters probably meant she was rejecting any form of familiarity between them.

“Kasumi-chan, you have been rude to Shiba-senpai for a while now.”

As expected, Izumi could not ignore what was going on and spoke to her in a candidly needling tone — Izumi was clearly paying attention to Kasumi. The fact that she wasn’t whispering might mean that giving excuses for each other’s behavior was an aspect of their relationship.

On their side, Azusa, Isori, and Honoka could not conceal their surprise over the fact that Miyuki had said nothing. Her sisterly love for Tatsuya was practically a credo for her; it was normal for anyone who showed ill will to Tatsuya to be burned (frostbitten?) by her wrath. Despite that, the gaze Miyuki was directing toward Kasumi could be called a pleasant one. Rather than suspicious, the three of them found that terrifying. It was typically the calm before the storm.

Of course, Azusa and the rest were over-thinking it. Miyuki, who was attuned to any ill will directed against Tatsuya, completely understood that Kasumi did not despise her brother — her attitude was a mix of jealousy and wariness. Miyuki felt sympathetic to Kasumi’s feelings of hostility to any male who came too close to her beloved older sister, and to Miyuki, since there was little chance of her developing a crush on Tatsuya, Kasumi was a cute junior she could associate with in a relaxed manner.

“I see, that’s unfortunate.”

By that Miyuki meant that it was unfortunate for Miyuki herself that Kasumi had decided not to join the Student Council.

“So then, Izumi-san, can we count on you to join the Student Council?”

However, Miyuki did not reveal any of her feelings about that or show that she wanted to keep her distance from Izumi; Miyuki just cheerfully asked the question.

“Happily.”

Although the feverish gaze Izumi aimed at her grew gradually hotter, Miyuki’s perfect ladylike smile did not falter.




After school and after Kasumi wasted time in the library for a while, she went to the café alone. Thirty minutes still remained of the time she had to wait until she met with Izumi, who had gone to the Student Council earlier. The time seemed to be slightly longer than that as she waited alone. Izumi had told her that it was alright to leave first if she got tired of waiting, so what should I do, Kasumi mused lazily.

“What’s wrong? You don’t look okay, somehow.”

Without warning, a voice addressed her. When she lifted her face, there was a young staff member in a pantsuit in front of her.

“Uh, no, I’m not ill or anything.”

Kasumi had intended to indicate “I want you to leave me alone” with that answer. However, her words were enunciated less clearly than she had planned, shocking even herself.

The female staff member offered a smile that seemed to see right through Kasumi’s bewilderment and sat down across from Kasumi without asking. Kasumi was slightly taken aback by this unilateral maneuver, but as she looked at the somewhat disingenuous smile, she quickly decided it did not matter.

“I’m a counselor at this school, Ono Haruka.”

“I’m Saegusa Kasumi, first year.”

Haruka had aimed her self-introduction for the precise moment that the troubled look vanished from Kasumi’s face and Kasumi had automatically given her name in return.

“Saegusa-san is in Class C, I believe?”

“Yes, that’s right.”

Because Haruka had stolen the initiative, Kasumi was following Haruka’s lead.

“Class C isn’t in my charge, but I’ll listen to any worries you have.”

“I’m not really worried about anything.”

Her mental resistance didn’t last long and Kasumi earnestly talked about how she had to spend too much time waiting for Izumi, who had joined the Student Council.

“I see. You have mixed feelings about it?”

Haruka, who had leaned forward to listen to Kasumi’s tale with a serious face, offered those words in a whisper.

What do you mean by mixed, Kasumi thought suspiciously, but Haruka’s words continued faster than Kasumi could question her.

“Saegusa-san, why don’t you give the Public Morals Committee a try?”

For Kasumi, Haruka’s suggestion was abrupt and completely unexpected. Haruka smiled agreeably as she peeked into the eyes of Kasumi, who couldn’t make an immediate response.

“Do you know of our school’s Public Morals Committee system?”

The question just now required a simple “yes” or “no” answer.

“Yes… I heard about it from my older sister.”

Although Kasumi remained perplexed, she was still able to answer this question.

“Okay. Then I can make this quick.”

Haruka did not ask who Kasumi’s “older sister” was. The family name of “Saegusa” was both uncommon and well known so she knew who Kasumi’s older sister was without asking; moreover, Haruka had known Kasumi’s identity before she had introduced herself.

“Actually, the staff recommendation is one way to get on the committee. To make it short, we pick freshmen to fill the vacancies in the committee.”

“You mean me? Excuse me, is it alright to unilaterally decide that right here?”

“If you were to accept it, no one would complain.”

Haruka smiled slightly at the expected outburst from Kasumi, who had finally regained her vitality.

“I thought that you would be able to do work that would not be inferior to Shiba-kun’s last year.”

And this remark, spoken in a superficially casual manner, made the eyes of Kasumi, who until now was not really interested, change color.

“Shiba-senpai, do you mean the elder brother?”

“Yes.”

For an instant, Haruka’s face displayed a “gotcha” look but Kasumi didn’t notice.

“Last year, Shiba, who was recommended by the Student Council, stood out as much as a member of the Public Morals Committee as Chief Watanabe-san herself. The staff-recommended Morisaki is also remembered for his reliable battle skills, but it is undeniable that he was seen as somewhat overshadowed by Shiba-kun. Besides last year, problems occurred with one of the other committee members recommended by the staff. If things like that continue a bit more, then people will look suspiciously at the staff. It would help us a lot if you would undertake this.”

It might not have been necessary for Haruka to articulate two reasons. When she made the point about Tatsuya standing out, Kasumi was filled with a blend of fighting spirit and antagonism.

“I understand. Please let me do it!”

She was so enthused right now, she seemed to have flames behind her.

“…Thank you. I’ll contact the Public Morals Chief. I think you might even be contacted by them tomorrow.”

Since she knew that trouble had occurred before and after the admissions ceremony, Haruka had used that knowledge to incite her. However, she had been more stirred up by it than Haruka had predicted. What on earth had actually happened, Haruka could not help wondering.





Chapter 7




The freshmen representative deciding not to join the Student Council was an unthinkable event, but without any other fuss, First High School went into club recruitment week. (Azusa muttered something like “this year, let there be peace…” which all the Second Year officers pretended not to hear.)

However, without exception each year, trouble to a greater or lesser extent (in this case, “lesser” might be an unneeded adjective) occurred during new club member recruitment week, so there was no way it would end peacefully. The recruitment week started on the second Monday in April and went until Friday the thirteenth. Azusa’s prayer of “may we get through it this year without anything happening” was an impossible dream that would die a noble death.

On this day and every day prior to it, Tatsuya and Miyuki were on standby after school in the club affairs headquarters. That way they could respond instantly when trouble erupted. Last year, Mayumi and Hattori had occupied this position. Having two Student Council Vice Presidents was an irregular configuration and emptying the Student Council room of these two Vice Presidents might be perceived as presenting an easily destroyed battle formation, but doubting Miyuki’s magic abilities was an indulgence no one dared attempt and Tatsuya’s true strength had been proven beyond doubt in a different dimension than practical skills classes, which is actual practice (actual combat). If the siblings patrolled as an actual unit, whatever anyone actually thought beneath the surface, no one would oppose it.

In that room, they were on stand by with one of the executives of the club affairs’ Public Safety Division. Since before Hattori’s inauguration as Chairman, a system had been in place where each club sent one member to the Public Safety Division as needed, but since he had become Chairman, the regular system had undergone a change — the scale had expanded. All twenty members in a four shift rotation were stationed in their main office in a battle array; it was the largest force in school exceeding that of the Public Morals and the Student Council. Although he was undeniably inferior in terms of charisma to the previous Chairman, Katsuto, Hattori’s abilities as an organizational manager were superior to his predecessor as shown by this action.

Yesterday, the headquarters was stuffed with Public Safety Division members. The members were almost entirely students Tatsuya hadn’t had much contact with, including the Second Years. He didn’t know much more than their names and faces. However, today there was a senior with whom he was more than vaguely familiar with.

“Nevertheless, it’s quite strange. I, who clumsily caused an incident last year that nearly got me suspended, now one of the people controlling the chaos this year.”

“Senpai, is that something you should say about yourself?”

“Kirihara, please don’t talk about that too much… I’d be troubled if someone came in and took it the wrong way.”

Tatsuya’s response had a “shocked” tone, but Hattori really put on a show with his response: an elbow on the desk, fingers rubbing his forehead and sighing deeply.

“It’s probably okay. Since no one’s listening.”

Currently, there were only four people in the club affairs room: Hattori, Kirihara, Tatsuya, and Miyuki. There were four members of the Public Safety Division on duty today, but two of them were making sure that the schedule for the use of the small gym for demonstrations was kept to by apparently going to watch them, and the other two had been patrolling around campus from the beginning.

“Oops, I jinxed it. We’ll cut off this conversation here.”

However, immediately after Kirihara claimed “there’s no one here”, the third year female member of the Public Safety Force came back from the small gym.

“The Kendo club’s demonstration has just started.”

Behind the female student who was reporting on the status of the small gym to Hattori, Tatsuya checked the clock and, as ordered, changed the topic.

“Ah. Apparently the Kendo club is adhering to the time limit quite punctually.”

Kirihara said this because many clubs went over their time limit for demonstrations.

“You’re not going Senpai? You spent more hours practicing with the Kendo club in March.”

“You’re well informed…”

“I was in the Public Morals Committee last month. Occasionally, I would watch the practices.”

“Just when… I was completely unaware of you.”

The look Kirihara was sending Tatsuya was tinged with horror and fear. However, seeing Tatsuya’s aloof face made Kirihara quickly unclench his shoulders. He recalled that it was all meaningless at this point.

“Certainly, I participated in the practices, but I didn’t transfer to the Kendo club. The week after next, the Kendo club has a practice match.”

As he spoke, Kirihara named the school that was the national high school champion.

“They are taking part.”

“So, that’s why you have been attending the Kendo club practices?”

“That’s right. It’s a good opportunity, I thought it shouldn’t be wasted.”

Tatsuya and Kirihara had met in close to the worst possible way, but now they were close enough to chat harmoniously like this.

However, a bulletin chime rang out on Hattori’s desk, interrupting this calm interval.

The sound of the old fashioned bell signaled Hattori that a report had just been received by the mechanism in the desk. After a short call, he stood up and called over Tatsuya and Miyuki.

“Shiba, Shiba-san.”

It was a complicated phrasing but this was Hattori’s default way of addressing the pair.

“Yes?”

Miyuki answered in a calm voice. Tatsuya silently stood up and waited for Hattori’s next words.

“Trouble has broken out at the Robot Research club’s garage. Go arbitrate it.”

Hattori looked at Tatsuya as he gave those directions. There was no deep meaning to it — Tatsuya was simply the easier person to give orders to.

“Understood.”

This time, Tatsuya was the one to respond vocally. Miyuki showed her agreement with a bow and the pair went to the scene.




Activities to recruit freshmen were limited to one week; afterward, they were limited to freshmen who voluntarily applied, which was the principal source of conflict between the clubs who took part in magic-based sports. Nevertheless, that definitely didn’t mean clubs other than the sports clubs did not clash during recruitment week. Right now, in front of the garage the Robot Research Club used as a clubroom, the Robot Research Club and the Bike Club were glaring at each other with a single freshman caught between them.

The Bike Club was not a club for the purpose of riding bikes; their club’s activities included making and remodeling bikes and were originally part of the Robot Research Club. It would be okay to say that the Robot Research Club had split on movement using legs and movement using wheels. Due to this background, the two clubs were normally at odds. The Bike Club, which rented a former car maintenance facility nearby, could be said to harbor more antagonism to its rival than the Robot Research Club, who had a garage on campus.

Both clubs had their eyes on an extremely eye catching freshman with platinum blonde hair, silver eyes and white skin. His slight physique and winsome facial features gave off an impression of cuteness to observers. He was a boy that stirred up desires to “make him their mascot” in the second and third year girls. The third year girls of both clubs were standing in the front rows of those glaring at each other.

“Give up gracefully. Sumisu-kun said he would join the Robot Research club, right?”

The name of the freshman who had become the prize in their battle was Sumisu Kento. The freshman Tatsuya had found wandering around lost before the admissions ceremony.

“Haven’t your ears gotten bad from using the press machine too much? Sumisu-kun hasn’t said one word about that, right. Because we were the ones to talk to him first, your side has no cause to complain.”

“We’re not first come first served elementary students. Have you been shaken up like the old fashioned reciprocating engines you try to fix?”

“Old fashioned?! Those words are only to be expected from a cutting edge geek who is hooked on playing with life-sized mechanical dolls!”

A pretty large crowd of riffraff had been drawn to watch the unsightly mudslinging match between girls as spectators. However, the male club members hanging back behind the girls,

“Old-fashioned…?”

“Geek…?”

Got pretty revved up, apparently by those keywords.

“Uh, I…”

—The original cause of their conflict, Kento, was left in a lurch.

Right now, the mood was explosive. The first to arrive at the scene were not Student Council officers or Public Morals Committee members, they were the members of the Public Safety Division independently patrolling.

“The Robot Research Club and the Bike Club please calm down!”

The first to enter the breech was a member of the Public Safety Force, Tomitsuka Hagane, a Second Year student.

Taking a place next to him was Public Safety Trainee, Shippou Takuma.

For Shippou Takuma, who was apparently recruited by Hattori — or at least it looked that way — to join the Public Safety Division to which he had enthusiastically agreed, this was his first assignment: to assist Tomitsuka in arbitrating any trouble between clubs they happened upon.

Takuma’s vigor had pushed Kento out of the battle ring.

“Aren’t you Kento?”

Then he met Tatsuya and Miyuki who had arrived just after Tomitsuka.

“Ah, Shiba-senpai.”

Kento happily turned around to look at Tatsuya. He did not pay attention to Miyuki who was standing beside Tatsuya. This could be called extremely unusual. While he felt somewhat uncomfortable with Miyuki’s deeply interested innocent gaze, Tatsuya questioned Kento.

“What happened?”

At this point, Tatsuya had no way of knowing that Kento had anything to do with starting the trouble that was going on before his eyes.

He had caught his eye and Tatsuya had spoken to him only because he actually knew him.

“Ah, um, I’m sorry, Senpai!”

Even if Kento suddenly apologized, Tatsuya had simply no way to know what was going on.

“I haven’t decided which club to join yet, I intended to merely take a look around today, but since I went in to hear more about the club, it suddenly got like this afterwards…”

He was probably excited, and Kento’s statement was almost completely incoherent. While Tatsuya was painstakingly working through that difficult to understand explanation, the situation underwent a new change.

“Public Morals Committee!”

Tatsuya heard a quarrelsome note in that familiar voice. The Robot Research Club and the Bike Club members were proclaiming their own righteousness in high pitched voices and Tomitsuka was raising his voice to be heard above them, so no one was really responding to the person who spoke.

“Eh? That’s Kasumi-chan, Onii-sama.”

“Ah…”

Tatsuya had not deigned to face the direction that screaming voice had come from, but that really didn’t matter much. Even without Miyuki telling him, Tatsuya had recognized that Kasumi had identified herself as a member of the Public Morals Committee.

“Kento.”

Kento, who had looked over his shoulder with wide eyes in the direction of Kasumi’s excited voice, returned his attention to Tatsuya.

“Oh, yes, I’m sorry.”

“It’s not really something you have to apologize for.”

Tatsuya smiled slightly at Kento, who was so nervous it was almost pitiful. There was a thick layer of sniggering in that smile, but it only appeared like that to Miyuki at his side, who knew all his smiles. —The person it was directed at, Kento, didn’t notice.

“Yes, I’m sor—ah.”

“…Alright.”

Before an awkward silence could descend over them, Tatsuya continued speaking.

“In short, the Bike Club misunderstood your intentions and the Robot Research Club managed to get tangled up in that?”

“Umm, yes, maybe…”

“I see… Well, that part seems fine, now.”

The quarrelsome voices they had heard earlier had been replaced with other voices. And they had not noticed the beginning of a dangerous interchange. There was still the threat of a magic fight starting in the air; while the Robot Research and Bike Club members were settling down, the source of that threat — was a confrontational Takuma and Kasumi, who were glaring at each other.

“Kento, it’s alright for you to go. Leave talking to the Robot Research and Bike clubs to me.”

While the thought of the underclassmen who had come here to arbitrate one incident starting one of their own made his head hurt, Tatsuya directed Kento to leave the area.

“Yes… Thank you.”

Kento seemed a little hesitant about whether he could allow Tatsuya to settle the matter for him, but in the end, he made a bow to Tatsuya and obeyed his command.

“This matter is already being handled by the club affairs Public Safety Division. So you can leave already, Public Morals member.”

This had been the first thing Takuma had said to start the dispute.

His arrogant way of speaking instantly made Kasumi flinch. However, when she recognized him as a fellow freshman, she indignantly spoke back to him.

“But I believe the Public Morals Committee has jurisdiction over disputes between students.”

So there’s no reason for me to just dolefully leave, Kasumi implicitly informed and tried to bypass Takuma.

“Hey, wait.”

Takuma reached out to take hold of Kasumi’s arm as she passed him. However, that hand wasn’t able to grab hold of anything. Kasumi made a smooth sidestep and evaded Takuma’s hand. Takuma was momentarily dumbfounded by his unthinkable failure to grab her; however, seeing Kasumi’s triumphant look made his blood boil and rush all to his head.

Naturally, even Takuma was not so simple minded as to use that as an excuse for violence.

“Persistent aren’t you. Can’t you stop getting in the way?”

Nimbly going around Takuma who got in her way again, Kasumi spoke to him in a bored tone.

“I said we’re taking care of things, Saegusa. Or can’t you understand that, without me speaking more clearly? There’s no reason for you to intervene.”

“Hmm… Shippou-kun. You know who I am?”

Kasumi looked at Takuma with meaningful eyes and attempted to forestall him with words.

“Do you even notice when you’re being treated as a hindrance? What a sorry state. You do know that Public Morals members don’t have to obey the orders of the Public Safety Division.”

Within Kasumi’s slightly amused expression, only her eyes were glimmering with the light of battle.

“Saegusa… are you picking a fight?”

Takuma was the opposite with his red faced expression, only his eyes contained a cold light.

“I don’t intend to pick a fight. But, I’m always ready to accept one.”

“Oh… so you’re ready to take me on?”

Takuma’s left sleeve was tugged back slightly. Revealing the form of a bracelet style CAD. Officially, only members of the Student Council and Public Morals Committee were permitted to carry CADs on campus, so members of the Club Affairs Public Safety Division who were not members of those organizations were forbidden to carry them. However, some of the rules against carrying CADs were relaxed during club recruitment week. What glittered on his wrist was not a CAD with safety limits for use in competitions, but his personal one that was suitable for actual combat.





“I guess so, I’ll do my best to give you more of a fight than you expect. Enough that you won’t consider picking a fight with me again.”

Kasumi also tugged back her left sleeve to reveal her left arm. It sat slightly higher on her wrist than Takuma’s, it was on the small size and it was designed to look prettier, however the CAD within was a cutting edge model that was not in any way inferior.

“You don’t seem to have anyone with you. You okay with doing it solo?”

“What? You want the excuse that you lost because it was two to one?”

Takuma and Kasumi were now already incapable of noticing anything but the adversary right before their eyes. Not even the fact that the dispute between the Robot Research Club and the Bike Club that they had come to arbitrate was now in the middle of a armistice or that Kento, the one who triggered their dispute, had already left the scene.

“Wait a minute!”

The dispute between the Robot Research and the Bike Clubs had drawn a big gallery of spectators. A male student suddenly intervened before they could have what looked like an inevitable and extremely public battle.

“Both of you, settle down!”

This was Tomitsuka who had been stunned by the malice Takuma and Kasumi had been invoking into the atmosphere until now.

“Senpai, please don’t interfere.”

“I said settle down, Shippou!”

“Tomitsuka-senpai, are you protecting Shippou-kun?”

“No way! Saegusa-san you settle down as well!”

…With Tomitsuka between them, the violent mood receded somewhat, but it didn’t feel like they were done snarling at each other. Due to this, neither the Robot Research nor the Bike Club felt like bringing up the fact that the dispute that had brought them here hadn’t been resolved yet.

“Everyone, isn’t it time to go back to whatever you were doing?”

So, the voice that called out from the side made them feel like they had been graced with a proclamation from an angel (it was quite convenient).

“Do not make this incident a problem for the Student Council. I will be the one who talks to the Public Morals Committee and the Public Safety Division.”

Tatsuya had followed after Miyuki with an assertion “to not make this incident a problem”, which meant that the Robot Research Club went back to the garage and the Bike Club went back to their tent to gradually resume recruitment. Tatsuya and Miyuki also went back to Club Affairs headquarters; all that remained was the gallery of onlookers and the three people who had garnered their attention: Takuma, Kasumi and Tomitsuka.





Chapter 8




“……And that’s why it was so annoying.”

“Ha…… I’m amazed you were able to hold back, Kasumi-chan.”

The same day, during the evening of April 13th, AD 2096. It was only after the children finished dinner that they were informed that guests were coming (even though their two eldest brothers were not home yet), so Kasumi came to Izumi’s room to complain about what had happened after school.

“Hm, well, when I thought about all the cleanup afterwards, I felt that it would be better not to throw down there. However, to be honest, I really wanted to kick his ass.”

As she was sitting on the rug with her hands wrapped around a pillow, she socked the pillow two or three times probably because she was pretending that the offending item was Takuma.

“Speaking of which…… Based on your story, Shippou-kun’s attitude was a little too unfriendly.”

“That wasn’t something cute like being unfriendly. He was blatantly picking a fight.”

“Yes, yes. Then, since he was picking a fight, how did he explain the antagonism displayed by the Club Activities Group to the Public Moral Committee?”

“Yeah. That’s why I said that guy was picking a fight against the Saegusa because he’s a Shippou.”

Hearing the suggestion from the seated Kasumi as she excitedly related what happened, Izumi did not see this as her personal feelings and reject it.

“Setting aside whether he’s acting on behalf of the Shippou, it remains true that he has shown hostility.”

Hearing Izumi’s unexpected perspective, Kasumi threw the pillow down with both hands as she blinked several times.

“So it’s not for the Shippou Family, but for his own personal grudge?”

“Can’t believe you said grudge, Kasumi-chan…… Well, I guess that’s close enough.”

Seeing Kasumi’s exaggerated display, Izumi nodded with a bewildered expression before putting on an expression of rapt attention as she thought to herself.

“I heard that the head of the Shippou Family is a moderate. Based on the rumors, he shouldn’t be the type to do anything that directly antagonize the Saegusa Family……”



At the same time, the head of the Saegusa Family, Saegusa Koichi was preparing to welcome the scheduled guest.

“A pleasure to meet you. My name is Sawamura Maki.”

“We have been waiting for you. I am the head’s daughter, Mayumi. Please follow me.”

The one who welcomed her was Mayumi. This was not a coincidence, as Koichi ordered Mayumi to lead the way. After leading Maki to the guest dining hall, Mayumi felt more suspicious than curious.

(This person should be the actress Sawamura Maki-san…… What business does an artist have with the Ten Master Clans……?)

If the visitor was a politician or an industrialist, Mayumi would not have found anything odd regardless of the visitor’s gender. Even someone from the entertainment circle seeking the power of Magicians itself was not something out of place. However, employing the might of the Ten Master Clans on someone from the cream of the entertainment business was a mite too much.

“Otou-sama, I have brought Sawamura-san.”

Despite how suspicious this was in her mind, none of this was reflected on her face. Perfectly playing the part of a refined daughter welcoming a guest, Mayumi led Maki to the dining hall where her father was waiting.



After allowing Mayumi to leave from the doorway and dismissing the maids in attendance, Koichi remained seated as he opened the conversation with Maki.

“This should be the second time we have met.”

Adopting a similar seated posture, Maki smiled back.

“I am honored that you remember me.”

“You’re welcome. Please, enjoy yourself before the dinner gets cold.”

A full array of appetizers and main entrees was set up on the table. The format intentionally avoided presenting one dish at a time because Koichi was aware that this was supposed to be a secret negotiation. Nor did Maki raise a fuss over this.

“Thank you very much. Then allow us to dine.”

Accompanied by a somewhat suave answer, Maki picked up her utensils. Completely different from the slightly nervous tic in her manners, Maki’s table manners were impeccable.

In Maki’s eyes, Koichi seemed to smile in satisfaction upon seeing this.

“Ah, my apologies.”

It was impossible to determine how to decipher that look – maybe because he wished to muddle the issue, Koichi opened his mouth to offer his apology.

“How rude of me to wear these glasses indoors.”

“No, I am aware of the details surrounding your story.”

When he was 14, Koichi was the victim of an international kidnapping incident that targeted Magicians, an incident that cost him his right eye in battle. Once he became an adult and his body’s development halted he began using a false eye, though he was quite famous during his teenage years as the “Young Magician with the Eye Patch” among magic circles. Now, he preferred to use lightly colored glasses to help disguise the oddity of the false eye. Such details were easily available with a small amount of investigation.

After exchanging small talk and finishing the main entrees, Maki adopted a proper sitting posture. Personally, she wanted to talk about this in a more natural atmosphere, but she was unable to find any weaknesses in Koichi while they were dining.

“In reality, I asked to borrow some of your time today because there’s something I wish to impart to you, Saegusa-sama.”



Just as Mayumi finished changing and was about to relax a little, the speaker leading to the door rang out.

“Onee-sama, this is Izumi. May I speak with you?”

“Of course. Please do.”

The words “please do” were actually the pass phrase. The voice recognition system from the HAR (Home Automation Robot) received Mayumi’s voice and disengaged the lock. Entering the door were Izumi and Kasumi coming in together.

“Sorry, but there’s something I would like your opinion on.”

Hearing Izumi’s request, Mayumi thought “Oh?”. She did not say “please teach me” but “your opinion” instead. In other words, this was something unrelated to school studies or magic training.

“What is it?”

“Onee-san, do you know what kind of a person is the head of house for the Shippou Family?”

The first thing that ran across Mayumi’s mind after hearing Kasumi’s question was “Why would you ask such a thing?”, but the answer immediately flashed through her mind.

“Kasumi-chan……”

Mayumi was well aware of how terrible her facial expression was right now without seeing her young sisters’ reactions.

“W-What is it?”

Not only had her tone changed, even the eyes were wandering all over the place. Seeing Kasumi’s reaction, Mayumi was even more certain that her instincts were correct.

“Something happened between you and Shippou-kun.”

“How did you know that!?”

Kasumi didn’t play dumb and immediately capitulated (more like confessed). No, she actually wanted to cover this, but Mayumi’s overly decisive remark prompted a more honest reaction out of her.

“You……”

“Please wait, Onee-sama.”

Seeing Mayumi set to deliver a tongue-lashing, Izumi quickly intervened from the side.

“It was true that Kasumi-chan almost got into a private duel with Shippou-kun, but the responsibility for today’s incident lies more with Shippou-kun and not Kasumi-chan.”

Mayumi searched Izumi with a suspicious gaze. However, Izumi’s gaze never wavered. Mayumi gave a huge “Whew……” of relief as her expression relaxed.

“I understand. I believe you.”

Hearing this, now it was Kasumi’s turn to let out of a huge “Whew……”. The secret glance she darted at Izumi contained definite traces of “Thanks!”.

“So that’s why the two of you wanted to know about the personality of the Shippou Family’s head.”

Mayumi furrowed her brows as she adopted a considerate posture.

“True…… Though I have not spoken to him in length…… He should be a very practical and considerate person.”

“Practical and considerate?”

Not comprehending, Izumi parroted back her words. “Practical and considerate” was too vague for personality analysis, so she didn’t feel that they were characteristics.

“Indeed. Practical and considerate, so there’s no way to tell what he’s thinking on the inside. After preparing many strategies, he is not greedy for profits and will choose the one with the lowest risk, so long as the original costs are covered. That is the type of person he is.”

Mayumi’s answer came after she correctly assessed her sister’s confusion, but this answer only served to arouse new questions from her sisters.

“But, if that’s the case……”

“Yeah. As I thought, this seems like the complete opposite personality type from what Kasumi-chan saw from Shippou-kun.”

“Then, in other words, he’s not acting on behalf of the Shippou Family’s plans?”

“Even so, there’s only so much a high school student can plan for with their limited powers. Shippou-kun should be aware of how fruitless this is regardless of how high his magic power is.”

“Does he have another backer besides the Shippou Family?”

“……Wouldn’t that be too big of a stretch?”

Seeing the wild theories espoused by her sisters mushroom even further, Mayumi couldn’t help but interrupt.

“……Ah ha, that’s true.”

“……Indeed, I think we’re overthinking this.”

The two of them smiled as they said this, but neither Kasumi nor Izumi seemed to honestly accept that in their hearts.



While Maki was speaking, Koichi never uttered a word to interrupt. When she finished, Koichi picked up a glass of red wine from the table. After consuming a quarter of the contents, he let out a soft sound before setting the glass back onto the table.

“In other words.”

Finally, Koichi turned his gaze back to Maki.

“Your grandfather plans on breaking his secret agreement with the anti-magic faction, correct?”

In response to Koichi’s leisurely phrased question, Maki decively nodded “yes”.

“I also believe that the proclamations of anti-magic ideology are both unrealistic and harmful. Any aid extended towards that sort of thing would only become a noose around my own neck. My father is also well aware of that point.”

“Thank you. You appear to be someone who can come to a logical conclusion.”

Koichi slightly inclined his head and used his eyes to urge her onward.

“I believe the uses of magic should receive more evaluation from society. Not just in the military or the police force, I think that magic has a lot of potential in the areas of the media or entertainment.”

“Media aside, you said entertainment? That is a novel idea.”

“Please do not misunderstand, I do not view people who are Magicians as monkeys. I have no plans on turning magic into something that just draws attention.”

“Ho?”

“Filming movies are often accompanied by danger. Furthermore, we are often troubled by the fact that SFX or special effects are unable to bring enough realism. Naturally, there’s no need to speak of reporters, but both as actors and supporting staff, the value of magic is incalculable.”

“……So?”

Koichi urged her on with high interest across his face.

“Even for Magicians who are treated poorly due to the fact that they are not combat capable, I firmly believe that there are many areas in the filming or media realm where they can display their talents.”

“I see.”

“I will invite the Magicians who never had the chance to prove themselves and give everyone a chance to wield such a wonderful talent like magic. For this, I will definitely prepare a reward that will prove most satisfactory for you.”

Here, Maki broke off and peeked at Koichi’s face. After sucking in a small breath, Maki’s expression seemed to show her rallying her courage before speaking again to Koichi.

“From the Magicians’ perspective, I am an outsider. I am neither a close friend nor am I affiliated in any way. However, I want to become a good neighbor, a close friend, to all Magicians. I earnestly hope you understand that.”

“Which is why you have chosen to obstruct the ploy of the anti-magic camp?”

“I know very well that I am powerless, but at the very least, I feel that I need to present my sincerity.”

“In return, you hope to be acknowledged and invited in by the Magicians, is that right?”

Koichi verbalized Maki’s request, but Maki never faltered. This degree of perception was within her expectations.

“I am not so brazen as to hope to earn your approval…… I just hoped that you could acknowledge this, that’s all.”

Koichi gazed at Maki’s face in slight interest.

“Sawamura-san, not only do you qualify to be an actress, you also have a certain talent as a negotiator.”

Of course, Koichi was not praising Maki in the literal sense. In order to catch his true intent, Maki gathered all of her attention. Except in this case, there was no need.

“Still, you are too adept at hiding your true feelings. That is what is truly unfortunate. Depending on the time and location, revealing your true self at times is useful in drawing more concessions from your opponent.”

Koichi easily revealed his trump card.

“There is no lie in your words. However, using Magicians as your pawns is not restricted to only entertainment. You are gathering Magicians as part of a plan to use them as a more direct power, are you not?”

Maki’s face wavered greatly. Yet, that was only for an instant. Using her acting ability, she settled her rattled heart.

“Forgive my performance.”

Even in Koichi’s eyes, Maki appeared to be earnestly asking for forgiveness. In regards to earning brownie points here, Maki won a small victory.

“So long as you do not take action against Magicians affiliated with us, the Saegusa Family, I will not interfere with your plans.”

Maki suddenly raised her downcast eyes.

“Truly?”

Now, her expression was beyond her control, but to none of her detriment.

“I promise you.”

“Thank you very much!”

Personally, Maki knew she won this bet against herself. Though it was true that she lost while haggling with Saegusa Koichi, Maki had successfully removed the greatest unknown quantity that lay in the path of realizing the “new order” she envisioned.




After seeing Maki off, Koichi returned to his own room, carefully locked the door, and trod towards the telephone. After pressing the call button, he waited for 10 seconds. The image that was displayed on the tabletop’s small screen was the face of Elder Kudou.

“Mister, sorry for bothering you so late in the night.”

Koichi didn’t use “sensei” or “sir” and instead used “mister”. This was the custom since his private tutelage with Yotsuba Maya and Yotsuba Miya under Elder Kudou.

“No worries. You must have something important to say?”

“Indeed. I have something of utmost importance to discuss with you.”

Koichi said this as he gracefully extended his body towards the desk. On the camera, he looked like he was leaning in to discuss something private. In reality, what Koichi was about to discuss next was both a private conversation and a conspiracy.

“Actually, I just met with a member of the media.”

Koichi first laid everything out and explained that humanists (anti-magic supporters) from the USNA were manipulating the media within the country to the detriment of Magicians.

“Based on what I heard today, progress on the media has gone quite far.”

“Since it’s you, obviously this isn’t the first time you have heard about it. I thought you had already finished investigating everything about the media operation?”

Kudou asked without any hint of a smile.

“So you saw right through me.”

Without any resistance, Koichi conceded Kudou’s point.

Actually, Kudou was the one whose expression changed.

“I will listen to you for now.”

Kudou asked with an exhausted expression.

“What are you planning to do?”

“The Yotsuba have grown too powerful. They have long surpassed the Ten Master Clans and are beginning to upset the balance of the country. Mister, don’t you think so?”

At Kudou’s inquiry, Koichi responded with something that appeared unrelated.

“You are planning to use the anti-magic supporters to chip away at the Yotsuba’s power?”

However, Kudou seemed to correctly pinpoint what Koichi wanted to say. In short, this meant that Elder Kudou held the same concerns that Koichi did.

“At First High, there is a student who is closely connected to the 101st Battalion. A high school responsible for educating teenagers is connected to the military. Don’t you think this would be a topic of vast interest to the media or politicians from the ethics wing?”

“Your daughters are also attending First High.”

“In this situation, students would only be treated as victims.”

“First High’s principal is neutral…… Someone who refused to join your camp.”

“Indeed, but that is only a minor detail. I care far more about the connection between the 101st Battalion and the Yotsuba.”

Kudou’s next reply came more than 10 seconds later.

“……So that is your goal.”

“Not only that, but there is some speculation on that regard. So, how about this, Mister? So long as the negative activity is within acceptable parameters, I believe fervor for the anti-magic supporters will wane. In addition, the targets of their attacks are high school students, which if handled correctly, society’s ire could be directed towards anti-magic ideology. I believe that this plan bears a certain degree of merit towards the Ten Master Clans.”

“I do not have the power to approve of your plan. I never held the authority to do so.”

“Even without authority, you still have influence.”

“……I do not oppose your plan.”

“That is more than sufficient. Thank you very much.”

Koichi hung up the phone in satisfaction. Prior to the line going dead, the image of Kudou’s expression was rather reflective of his age in that it held no dominance at all.





Chapter 9




AD 2096, April 14th, Saturday night. The name on top said this was the home of Shiba Tatsurou; actually this was the home of Tatsuya and Miyuki which was welcoming strange guests.

“This is Tatsuya-niisan’s house?”

Ayako smilingly nodded yes to her younger brother who was standing at the entrance asking “Isn’t this too ordinary?” with his gaze.

“It’s not as if I don’t understand why you would ask that, but this is certainly it.”

While these siblings were confirming it, the word ordinary was not a word readily applied to Tatsuya and his sister. An old western mansion in the middle of nowhere or a secret laboratory surrounded by high fences would be a much more appropriate place for him to live, and both siblings felt that was where he should live.

However, Ayako had received the map data directly from Hayama. There was no way it was false. While Fumiya controlled his feelings of disbelief, he pressed the gate post call bell.

“Yes, whom may I say is calling?”

The response was in a voice neither sibling had heard before. The Kuroba siblings had last heard the voices of Tatsuya and his sister on January 3rd of this year when the pair visited the main house to do the New Year’s greeting. A full three months had passed but the siblings were confident that they would recognize the voices of Tatsuya and Miyuki.

“I am Kuroba Fumiya. I believe this is Shiba Tatsuya’s residence.”

Even so, the unknown voice did not make Fumiya pause and he gave his name as well as stating his errand. Some time passed until the next response, probably to ascertain what Tatsuya’s wishes were. Since this was an unexpected visit without prior communication, it was fortunate that they apparently hadn’t missed Tatsuya, thought Fumiya letting out a sigh of relief.

“Please enter.”

The motor made a faint sound as the front gate unlocked. Fumiya pushed the gate with arabesque scrollwork. And then faster than he stepped on to the grounds, the front door opened. Within it a young girl in a black dress and a white apron appeared and directed a deep bow to the pair.

The siblings were led to the living room where only Tatsuya was waiting for them.

“Fumiya, Ayako-chan, it’s been a while.”

They didn’t take offense over being greeted by Tatsuya who remained seated. Ayako seated herself directly across from Tatsuya. —Without being encouraged to sit.

“Nee-san!”

Fumiya properly remained standing politely and rebuked his sister’s rudeness, but Ayako listened to it as if it had nothing to do with her.

No, it was not as if she was ignoring him. Immediately after Ayako sat down, she politely placed both hands on top of her skirt, looked straight ahead and bowed.

“Tatsuya-san, it’s been so long since we’ve called on you. Please forgive us for the impoliteness of not taking the time to make an appointment with you beforehand.”

“It is not necessary to bother about such a thing. We’re second cousins, no, fellow kinsmen, furthermore fellow high school students. There’s no need for appointments for a visit between high school students who are relatives.”

“Thank you for your generosity. …Fumiya-san, what are doing? Quickly greet Tatsuya as well.”

It was a somewhat insolent excuse. Nonetheless, Fumiya with his fundamentally serious nature was unable to ignore his own wrongdoing.

“Fumiya, you sit too. Such formality will make it impossible to talk.”

Tatsuya smiled as he spoke those words to Fumiya who was standing stock still with emotions he did not understand. Upon Tatsuya urging him to sit, Fumiya somehow regained his calm and sat down next to Ayako as he was told to.

“Tatsuya-niisan, it’s been a while.”

Fumiya simply bowed his head. However, this was not due to his being reserved with Tatsuya or him looking down at Tatsuya or anything like that. Fumiya was simply nervous over meeting his second cousin that he respected and hadn’t seen in about three months.

At nearly the same time as that, Miyuki and Minami entered the living room. Miyuki was empty handed but Minami carried a tray with tea for four.

“Ayako-san, Fumiya-kun, please have some tea.”

Clad in a flare skirt that hit below the knee and prettily made up, Miyuki sat down next to Tatsuya. Miyuki, who had been wearing her usual at home attire, changed into her outside clothes to face their sudden guests.

“Miyuki-oneesama, pardon our intrusion.”

Undaunted by Miyuki, Ayako deliberately stood up and politely bowed. Her classical wide flowing dress fluttered elegantly with her movements. His elder sister’s display of her competitive spirit caused Fumiya to look away with a “my head hurts” look on his face (by the way, Fumiya was dressed in normal male clothing and wasn’t wearing a wig). Tatsuya watched the pair with amused eyes.

Just as Ayako sat down again, Minami placed the tea on the table.

“Please forgive us for coming so late at night… but, tomorrow morning, we have to be back in Hamamatsu.”

Fumiya broke the ice with his introductory remarks, at last calming the atmosphere.

“The hour is not so late that it can be called late at night.”

Actually, the said late hour was just about after dinner would be finished. Nevertheless, the pair’s late night visit did not feel troublesome. Fumiya and Ayako were the relatives closest to Tatsuya and Miyuki in age, and some of the very few relatives that they knew were not their enemies.

“Come to think of it, I haven’t said it yet. Congratulations for getting into Fourth High School.”

“With the abilities of you two, it’s a natural outcome, though. Congratulations, Ayako-san, Fumiya-kun.”

Taking her cue from Tatsuya’s remarks, Miyuki offered her congratulations. It was well past the announcement of the exam results and it had been about a week since the admissions ceremony, but it had been about three months since they had direct contact.

“Thank you. Tatsuya-san, Miyuki-oneesama.”

“Actually, I considered going to First High School, but-”

Ayako-san offered her thanks, and Fumiya followed after his sister with a pained smile that had more pain than smile.

“I was told that it wasn’t good for too many of us to be in one place.” (Fumiya)

“You made a request to Oba-sama?”

Ayako nodded in response to Miyuki’s question.

“We didn’t receive a reply from the honored clan leader directly, though.”

“Her instructions were passed to father by Hayama-san, give up on First High School.”

Whatever she actually felt, Ayako’s face did not show any upset about it at all, but Fumiya appeared to regret it deeply.

“If Oba-ue forbade it, nothing can be done.”

Tatsuya responded with a tone of generalized sympathy to comfort Fumiya and then casually changed the subject.
