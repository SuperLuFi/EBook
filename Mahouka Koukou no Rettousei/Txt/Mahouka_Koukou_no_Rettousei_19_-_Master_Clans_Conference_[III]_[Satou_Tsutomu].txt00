	Chapter 11





	Psion waves, interfering with the use of magic, filled the space on the road leading from First High to the station. It was Antinite, a resource that ordinary people could not get. Minami's face twisted into a grimace. She pressed her hands to her chest and leaned down as if under pressure. The heaviness of her breathing was visible on the ascending and descending shoulders. Seeing these sufferings, Miyuki remembered that very summer day 5 years ago.

	August 11, 2092, the day of the invasion of the Great Asian Alliance to Okinawa. This happened during the attack of traitors on the basis of self-defense forces. Honami, Miyuki and her mother were shot because her strength was enough to "freeze" only one enemy. At that time they were rescued by the "Restoration" of Tatsuya. But Honami never returned home from there.

	And now the girl, exactly like Honami, suffered in her eyes from "Cast Jamming". This scene could not get out of her mind, she scrolled again and again ...

	"... It's unforgivable." Miyuki's voice was full of anger.

	"You are tormenting her again."

	"Again you want to take her."

	"I will not let you do this."

	"This time, I'll stop you."

	"This time, I'll" stop "you ALL."

	Surrendering to memories, Miyuki completely fell out of the current reality. Guided by the anger and regrets of the past, she tried to free her strength.

	"Miyuki-sama, please stop!" - A painful scream Minami chilled Miyuki's ardor. "Do you want to betray Tatsuya-sama's expectations?"

	In the memory of Miyuki, Tatsuya's words arose, which she forgot in a flash of anger.

	"It will be very bad if the one who is declared the successor to the Yotsuba clan, attacks ordinary people with magic."

	These words Tatsuya told her the day before yesterday. Obviously, his words had a higher priority in her mind, even higher than the emotions from that day. The call of magic "Cocytus", which freezes people's mind, was stopped by mentioning the name Tatsuya.

	"Minami-chan?" - Miyuki turned to Minami with alarm in her voice and with fear on her face.

	"I'm all right, Miyuki-sama." - Being in danger, she cared only to calm her mistress.

	Weakened by "Cast Jamming" the barrier was restored due to the refusal of "slowing down" and concentration on "blocking". The attacking people buried their hands in an invisible wall and stopped. Seeing that the enemy was confused, Minami looked at Miyuki. They met their eyes, and in the eyes of Miyuki read a message that "everything is in order." After that, Miyuki returned her CAD to her pocket.

	"Miyuki-senpai?" "With a slight frown on her face from the psion noise, Izumi turned to Miyuki in a surprised voice. Miyuki should not have resistance to Cast Jamming.

	Izumi could not understand the reason for her self-confidence. But then she realized that although she herself was experiencing difficulty in invoking magic, it was her "Adored Miyuki-senpai" and for her it would be simpler than that. With that thought Izumi looked at Miyuki's face. Miyuki nodded to her, as if to say "no problem." After that, she put her hands on her chest and closed her eyes.

	Her body glowed softly. The light that ordinary people who were the "Humanists" cannot see. Visible only by magicians, psion light spread around Miyuki. In this "non-existent" light, there was no "Cast Jamming". For the outside observer there was no action or intent.

	Even for magicians, it looked like "Pure Psion Light." Psions that do not carry the power of intervention should not have any effect on magic. This light did not have any influence either on the Minami barrier or on the people who attacked them.

	Minami suddenly noticed that this soft light began to surround them. Pain from the "Cast Jamming" weakened.

	The action of "Cast Jamming" was the prevention of the activation of magic, and not a direct effect on the magicians. But while magicians were especially susceptible to psions, there may be nausea and dizziness from such a Cast Jamming.

	But given that this noise could block the construction of a sequence of magic, it was not just noise. For the application of magic, not only the concept of "purpose" is required, but also the concept of "source", which is the "magic calculation zone", located in the subconscious of the magician.

	At the moment of the summoning of magic, it is in the "source" and if it is subject to Cast Jamming it will simply not see the "goal". And magicians using continuous magic, such as a barrier, do this by updating it in short intervals, so the impact of noise on them is stronger.

	Minami realized that "Cast Jamming" had both mental and physical effects on her. But despite the impact of Cast Jamming, just that the discomfort from them was reduced by half.

	"Miyuki-sama?" Minami looked at Miyuki again. Her mistress did it. There is no doubt.

	"Miyuki-senpai, this is awesome!" You weakened the jamming by a dense stream of psions around us! "When she heard Izumi's voice, Minami understood that too. Psions that do not carry the power of noise should not have any effect on magic. But for noise, also not having the power of Cast Jamming, these psions have become a thick wall. "Humanists" fanatics also heard the voice of Izumi.

	- Nonsense! You cannot conjure with Cast Jamming! - The leader of the "humanists" shouted, ignoring what he saw.

	His words were amused by Izumi and Minami. They realized that you already cannot pretend. Because the very attempt to pretend was not a success.

	Minami suppressed a slight laugh. The smile on her face was not at all her plans. On the other hand, Izumi was already laughing. This was an obvious mockery of the attackers.

	In fact, "Cast Jamming" is effective against magic. But what Miyuki did was not exactly "magic" in the understanding of ordinary people. More precisely, it was the non-Systematic magic of psion control around his body.

	Being both magic and not magic, she interfered with interference, as if mocking the principles of magic. The fanatics who surrounded them, did not even guess how advanced the technique was now being shown, and how great its performer was. And also, that there is a magic that can overcome "Cast Jamming".

	For example, magic that breaks down the structure of the Psion waves, which violate the use of magic.

	Suddenly, the Psion noise from the Antinite stopped. The uneven wave of Psions suddenly subsided and became homogeneous.

	"Onii-sama!" Miyuki turned her eyes wide.

	Tatsuya stood there, with his usual soulless expression, but the fire in his eyes was clearly flaring.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Tatsuya found himself in a deadlock in his investigation in Kamakura, he could not find traces of the terrorist leader Gu Jie. He contacted Katsuto and said that he would miss the meeting today. After Kamakura, he was going to return to Zama to look again for clues. Look for Gu Jie more appropriate method. He decided to use his eyes once more. But suddenly a sense of danger arose. He immediately realized that the danger was not for him. He will feel it at any distance.

	The fact that Zhou Gunjin was a disciple of Gu Jie, and was killed by Tatsuya, will clearly set Gu Jie against him. But even the attempt on Maya was not important for Tatsuya. Superfluous thoughts only interfere with his view, overwhelming unnecessary information.

	When you've already seen the enemy "with a look", you just need to concentrate on it to find it again. And other surveillance goals should be removed for this time.

	This means that Miyuki will remain without observation.

	In Tatsuya's eyes, Gu Jie was not worthy of such a sacrifice.

	However, if he looks for something on the ground connected with Gu Jie, this may be the key to further research. If such a key really exists, it probably already found other pursuers, but the current situation was serious enough to follow even this small opportunity.

	But he turned around and drove back. But not home, but in the direction of the school.

	He did not have the gift of foresight. His view only sees the present and the past 24 hours ago.

	So it could be called just a guess. Guess that Miyuki can be in danger.

	Tatsuya could not just ignore this fact. Compared with the safety of Miyuki, Gu Jie and all the rest did not bother him. He switched the bike to semi-automatic mode and rushed towards First High, keeping on track a partial view of Miyuki through the information dimension to help at any time.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Tatsuya saw that Miyuki was surrounded by a crowd of anti-magicians. Still in motion on a motorcycle, he took off his helmet and took a deep breath. It was an attempt to calm down because of the fear that he would not be able to restrain himself from killing these bastards.

	Those who intended to harm his precious Miyuki cannot be forgiven. The only thing they deserve is to be instantly blown to the dust. If there is at least a slight chance of causing harm, he will not hesitate. Because he can destroy a person without leaving any evidence.

	He knew that the enemies were using Antinite, but he also knew that to Miyuki it would only bring a small discomfort, without affecting her mind. The fact that Minami suffered, did not cause him deadly intentions.

	But he was also not one of those who like to watch girls suffer. Especially those who are close to his family. By the decomposition magic, he erased the "Cast Jamming", bothering Minami.

	There is no need to use a CAD in the form of bracelets that he had on both wrists. "Decomposition" was one of two kinds of magic that he could use freely. To select the purpose of magic, he also did not need gestures such as "point with your finger" or "extend your hand". The goal was chosen simply by concentrating the consciousness on the object.

	[Gram Dispersion]

	The decomposition magic has erased the complex structure of psion waves that interfere with the use of magic. After destroying their structure, the waves became uniform, and no longer create the "Cast Jamming" effect.

	"Onii-sama!" Tatsuya heard the voice of his sister from the crowd. After intervals in the crowd he saw her surprised face. He found her surprise amusing. Most likely she believed that the problem was not so dangerous that he was in such a hurry.

	But his mind soon filled with anger. He saw in his sister's face weak, but, undoubtedly, it was a form of fear and anxiety. Schoolgirls were surrounded by a crowd of strange personalities. Regardless of how strong they are, to be afraid in such a situation is quite normal.

	He looked at the crowd and took a deep breath.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	- To the side! A sharp, angry voice came from Tatsuya's lips.

	Under the power of such a voice, the crowd reeled and parted. And this was not the magic of mental intervention. The bodies of people reacted before the mind, in the animal impulse of fear of a stronger being. Tatsuya walked forward with a quick pace. It was not even necessary to touch these people. No one stopped him. Not that he did not stop, there was not even the slightest attempt.

	- Minami. - Stopping at the barrier of Minami, he called her.

	"Yes, Tatsuya-sama." - There was an answer on the other side of the barrier.

	- Can you move with a raised barrier?

	"It's possible."

	It was assumed that Tatsuya knows that Minami can do this. Minami realized that the question meant concern for her condition.

	- I see. Then you three, follow me.

	Tatsuya looked around. Looking around, he went ahead, and already after the second step, the "humanists" backed away.

	"W-that you stood up!" Interference on! Run it again! - Antinite rings were in several people in the crowd, not enough for all, but apparently distributed to the best members of the sect. Inspired by the cry of the leader, despite the fact that their spirit was broken by Tatsuya, they poured psions into Antinite and again launched "jamming". The time for psion noise to take shape is less than half a second.

	Tatsuya only looked at the source of the problems. There was not the slightest movement of his hands.

	This was enough to stop the "interference".

	The noise of psion waves, which prevents the activation of any magic, has disappeared.

	In this case, it could not be a simple coincidence.

	The noise of "jamming" is the psion waves formed in a complex sequence according to a certain pattern. As long as they have a form, they cannot avoid Tatsuya's "Decomposition." The form is given by the information body. The trump card, neutralizing any magician, against Tatsuya was not something significant.

	- What the..!? - Fanatics shouted with rings on their hands.

	- Do not be afraid! Again! - Useless orders of the leader were repeated again.

	Tatsuya no longer looked back. The time to activate the interference was still less than half a second. But this time was enough for the decomposed structure of noise to not have time to form a single wave.

	Antinite has the property of converting psions poured into it into noise waves and the ability to propagate these waves. But the continued feeding of psions without hardware assistance (for example, such as in a flight device) is a difficult test for an ordinary magician. That's why the launch of "jamming" will be intermittent.

	And for a simple person who is not a magician who is not used to working with psions, this action requires very strong mental concentration.

	Noise broke down right after the ejection. The preparation of these people was not enough to concentrate two times in a row, and even more so for the third time.

	Tatsuya walked and led the three men behind him. After they left the "environment":

	- Minami.

	"Yes, Tatsuya-sama."

	- Good job. You can already remove the barrier. - Minami, following Tatsuya's words, deactivated defensive magic.

	- Miyuki.

	Hearing her name, Miyuki said in a calm voice: "Yes, Onii-sama."

	"Take these two back to school."

	- Yes, I do.

	Graciously bowing to her brother, Miyuki put her hands on her back to her "cohays" and pushed them toward the school.

	But the leader of the "humanists" still did not give up. One of the first steps away from confusion, he shouted:

	"W-What are you up to?" Do not let this Satan's offspring escape!

	Unfortunately for them, this led to sad consequences. Ignoring Tatsuya, or rather avoiding it, the crowd of "humanists" ran. But none of them did more than three steps. In all there were 15 people. They did not start running at the same time. A third of them, five people, ran first. The others were still standing. It was unnecessary to say that Tatsuya's job was to decide that that third of those fleeing (the restriction of liberty was also considered a crime) should be stopped. But without using magic.

	The first runner, taking just one step, got his fist into the solar plexus and fell to the ground.

	The second runner, making his second move, was knocked out by a chopping blow with the edge of his hand.

	The third one who ran, at the time of the completion of the second step, was caught by the seizure of his neck and fell on his back.

	The fourth runner, in an attempt to take the third step, unexpectedly (for himself) struck a preemptive blow to the jaw.

	The fifth runner, taking the third step, was seized by his wrist, and flew to the road, making a couple of turns in the air.

	Each of Tatsuya's punches became a knockout, none of this five stood up.

	- Hey, you! Do you think such violence is permitted by law? The screams of those who stayed remained to Tatsuya.

	With a provocative grin, Tatsuya looked ominously at them.

	- It was necessary to prevent violence against girls. Street cameras will confirm that you attacked first. - Tatsuya pointed them to the cameras, which were installed in this era everywhere, on every street lamp. The mocking smile still did not leave his face.

	And the face of the leader of the "humanists" blushed so that it could be seen from a great distance. And it was clearly not out of shame for his previous words. It looked pathetic and funny.

	The red-faced "leader" pointed to Tatsuya with his finger and shouted:

	"Then let's start with this asshole!" Divine punishment!

	His subordinates did not rush into battle. No, they heard strange voices expressing confusion. They felt the body, not the mind, that they had no chance against Tatsuya, and retreated.

	But, despite animal fear, the fanaticist poisoned by the fanaticism could not normally recognize reflex signals about danger.

	"Repent, sinner!" - Standing closest to Tatsuya, he swung at him with a sliding baton. Counter-movement of the left hand, Tatsuya met his hand with a club, striking her fingers clutching her.

	- Ghe ... - A club fell out of the hands of a guy. He squeezed his aching arm and moaned pitifully. Right hand Tatsuya, without stopping, rushed to the face of the same person. A blow that was faster than the eyes of ordinary people could notice. Quite slow, boring for him the pace. But Tatsuya's hand went away from the head. Reason disconnected, the body collapsed.

	"I warn you." If you continue to attack, you will not have a way back. - Tatsuya said this, examining the rest of the "humanists", and completely ignoring the body that fell at his feet. He did not try to provoke them. It was an honest warning.

	After making sure of his sister's safety, he became calm. He no longer felt any harmful intentions. But that did not mean that he would no longer fight. Being attacked, he will definitely answer. All these actions were a necessity for recording the happening of the street cameras.

	But it seems that these words only provoked them.

	- What a nonsense! You're just a miserable tool without social rights! - The leader of the "humanists" shouted in a mad voice. But his companions just looked at him. Enthusiasm pouagas before the fear of being beaten.

	Nevertheless, they apparently did not intend to leave. Apparently not yet departed from the shock. And in shock they were not from the fact that the magicians managed to get away from their "retaliation", but from the fact that they were defeated in the usual non-magical battle, which they themselves specialized in. For Tatsuya this hitch was only an advantage.

	On the way here, when he watched this crowd gather, he saw a police station nearby. He thought it best to leave the capture of these people to the police. And it's time they already appear.

	"The police will be here soon." Why do you not just run away? Perverts, trying to attack schoolgirls. Tatsuya uttered another warning. This time, the arguments in his words were even more convincing, but it seems they did not work either. Tatsuya himself did not recognize the need to pay attention to the wording. The fanatics seemed to break loose and looked violent.

	- This boy! - The leader of the "humanists" howled and rushed to Tatsuya himself. Tatsuya saw how he pulled out from under the clothes something flat about 50 cm long. It was a deafening whip that has a built-in electric shock on the tip, and when it starts to flow, it becomes elastic, like a spring. And when you turn it off, it contracts back and becomes like a leather belt that you can wear. Tatsuya recalled that he had seen this weapon among other devices developed by the Erica family for the police, but not yet on sale (Erica's cogs in the form of a stick with a shape memory alloy was an example of such a device). It cannot be obtained if you do not have connections with the police or with the supplier. Or did he take it from the police officer?

	If you conduct an investigation, an interesting story may pop up. Reflecting on such distant things, Tatsuya left the attacking whip in his direction. A moment later he was already behind the enemy. Observers thought that Tatsuya disappeared and the whip went through the void.

	- I'm here. Tatsuya spoke before he was found. The leader of the "humanists" looked around in panic. He waited for a retaliatory attack, but it did not follow. Then he decided to attack again, sending a blow to the head. Tatsuya raised his hands to block the whip, pretending and lowering his hand before the blow. He just ducked so much that the blow went above him. As the attack went into the void, the attacker lost his balance and fell, sitting on his ass. Tatsuya could not hold a slight laugh. But it was not a mockery. At least in Tatsuya's plans this was not. I just could not stand this circus anymore.

	He did not intend to ridicule the opponent's clumsiness, although he was not going to apologize. What happened, it does not change, there is nothing to help.

	- You're in deep trouble!

	It seems it all went too far. Moreover, the killing intentions of the screamer were not limited to words alone. He threw a useless whip and put his right hand in his pocket. At the moment when his hand was pulled out of his pocket, Tatsuya's right foot moved at a lightning speed. But it was not a blow, but a swing. Then the leg kicked the weapon out of the fanatic's hand with a sharp movement. The leg after the impact remained to stick forward. Then came a blow to the person who sent the leader of the "humanists" to lie on his back. Either the kick was enough, or else a blow to the ground helped, but it seemed to him that it was enough and he did not move anymore. The fact that he was such a weakling, Tatsuya's fault in this.

	A small double-barrel pistol, dropped from the hands of the leader of the "humanists", rolled along the road. On his side, Tatsuya saw the inscription "Dillinger", which was the newest model of the end of the 21st century from the well-known manufacturer. And it was definitely illegal for a civilian to have weapons.

	"Humanists" stood and looked at the deadly weapon lying on the ground. On their faces the expression "cannot be" was definitely read. Apparently their leader did not inform them that he took this with him.

	Tatsuya turned to the remaining fanatics. They have already lost their morale. It looked so, that they do not have the strength even to escape. On this, Tatsuya decided that the "combat" part of the task was solved. But soon something happened that made his face stretch in surprise.

	"Onii-sama!" - He heard a warning from his sister, who was watching from the other end of the street, and was ready to activate the magic.

	The body of the leader of the "humanists" rose to a sitting position. He had to be unconscious. No, he's still unconscious. But who cares about such an insignificant detail? Tatsuya decided that this was not an accident. On the hands of a humanist standing with an empty expression of a human face, activists were activated - so-called spiritual beings. But Tatsuya thought that for this dirty violet flame the term "ghost" rather than "spirit" would be more appropriate.

	"Miyuki, hide yourself!"

	- Yes!

	Following the command of his brother, Miyuki disappeared around the corner of the building. Tatsuya threw up his right hand and prepared. A moment later, a stream of psions flew from his hand. The violet flame was blown away by a strong psion wind.

	[Gram Demolition]

	This was the result of using the strongest magic of counteraction.

	- What!? Tatsuya said in a surprised voice. He was surprised because in the hands of the enemy, a spiritual fire broke out again. It was considered impossible to trigger magic again immediately after the demolition of the magic sequence by interrupting the spell.

	The interruption of the spell (Gram-demolition) is simply a blow by a stream of compressed psions. Its effect ends when the psion flow ceases. After that, there is no long-lasting effect of canceling magic. But the magic must restart in the subconscious mind of the magician. No matter how talented the magician, any magic has a design time. Even those Espers who can do without constructing an activation sequence will not be able to overwrite an event without a sequence of magic. Tatsuya did not see these processes in that person.

	"It's not his ability." The DS is received from third parties. "

	The spirit, that is, the "ghost", was clearly obtained by the method of indirect intervention, and was now controlled by someone from a distance. This meant that this "anti-magic" group was controlled by some user of ancient magic. Perhaps control is even carried out without the knowledge of these people. The probability of this was the most.

	Tatsuya wanted to try to blow the fire out again ... but he did not do it.

	People who decided on the riots as a protest against the terrorist attack of the user of ancient magic, themselves were under the shadow control of a certain user of ancient magic. It's hardly a coincidence. Taking the spiritual fire as a starting point, Tatsuya concentrated his eyes on the operator of this magic.

	"Ma-magic !?"

	"Leader ... wicked sorcerer !?" - Seeing the fireballs in the hands of his boss, the fanatics screamed in frightened voices.

	It seems that this time not only Tatsuya saw the fire. DS on the hands of the leader of the gang seems to have generated a material violet flame. The hands under this fire have already begun to darken. Apparently this fire had not only visual properties of luminescence, but also thermal ones.

	- Uhaaaaaa! - A recently looking cohesive group panicked to run in different directions, like children who saw a large spider. Tatsuya did not pursue them. More precisely, he did not have time to do it. As the violet fire exploded at the same time.

	But it did not look like the disintegration of a big fire into small ones, dozens of lights of the same size as the original ones, scattered in different directions from the hands. None of the fireballs damaged the surrounding buildings. When the fire touched walls or even windows, it disappeared like an illusion. But when the fire touched the trees, they instantly burned into coals in places of touch.

	No, the description of "burned" does not fit. What touched the violet fire "died" and turned black, as if getting old. It's like a curse that draws life. But what happens to the person who has fallen under this fire?

	Tatsuya shot back the flames to his side with a gram demolition. He defended only himself. Concentration on the user's search for this magic did not give the opportunity to shoot down all the lights. It was helped by the fact that the lights were not aiming and did not have a homing function.

	Several fireballs, which Tatsuya did not have time to knock down, passed to the left and right of him. Several of them flew toward the fleeing "humanists". They could hear screams of horror and panic.

	Tatsuya did not look back to the place where the fire came in contact with the body of one of the evaders. It looks like fire has aged the flesh only in the place of contact. Tatsuya did not see this event, but he clearly felt that this magic cannot just be left. Before it was quite late, he interrupted the search for a magic operator, and focused on countering the fire.

	If the operator of magic was the leader of "humanists", then you could just cut it down. But it's just the point of launching magic. In addition, you cannot cut someone who is already unconscious. The next option was killing the target. Perhaps the fastest way. Although there is a way to control the corpses, but Tatsuya's murderous magic wipes the bodies in the dust. No corpse will remain.

	But not at this time. Even in such a situation, this will be regarded as an excess of necessary defense, and the media will be inflated in favor of anti-magical sentiments.

	"An operator of ancient magic to control this fire must be somewhere nearby."

	But then the other "humanists" can be used as the launching point of magic? If they all suddenly shoot that purple fire, then Tatsuya cannot avoid some damage.

	"Perhaps there is some reason that only that one person was used."

	For example, that the connection of the DS with the host is effected through some "mark" applied to the body. Thinking about this possibility, Tatsuya activated the eyes.

	"You're in the way."

	Using gram-demolition, he again blew the fire from the hands of the "humanist". The restart of the fire did not take long.

	"...Found."

	On the hands of that man there were "seals". Some drawings, composed by psion, were applied to the back of the hand. Although the fire went out for just a moment, Tatsuya had enough of this to see the anomaly with his "vision." The seal was invisible to ordinary vision, as it was painted with skin color. Pattern Tatsuya was unknown, but the method of control psions was well known. The use of seals was a favorite method of the operators of ancient magic.

	Discarding the investigator's curiosity, Tatsuya used "decomposition" on the part of the press. The ink from the center of the complex picture was erased by a neat cut with the magic of "decomposition", which violated all the connections of the drawing.

	Attached to the hands of two fireballs were knocked down by gram demolition. It was the last shot. The psion print pattern was also demolished, which deprived the DS of communication with the host. Perhaps this seal was also needed to control the body of a "humanist". Because immediately after the breaking of the seal by the gram demolition, the man who had just sat and fired, suddenly collapsed on his back and did not rise again. This time it seems final.

	After waiting 10 seconds, Tatsuya decided that the situation was resolved.

	By this time the policeman arrived, looking out from the corner of the building, he shouted: "All of you! Do not move!". This useless type seems to be hiding there for a while and decided to act when it's all over. But of all "did not move" only Tatsuya. The policeman looked around the scene, raised his eyebrows when he saw the charred trees. When he looked at the "humanists," signs of fear appeared on his face. Quiet and unharmed Tatsuya in this chaos apparently seemed to him the main culprit.

	Undoubtedly, in the nearest police station to the Magical School, the staff were magicians, but it is rather doubtful that any of them could resolve this situation without sacrifice.

	Tatsuya stood still, following the command "Do not move." There was no reason to break this order.

	There is no need to move the body to chase the data. Data on the enemy magician, obtained from the press at the time of its decomposition. Right now Tatsuya was getting to the enemy in the information dimension. Despite the fact that the magic is already scattered and the connection is broken, the trace to the magic operator is still present in the information dimension data. A short distance to the goal in time and space. And also a causal relationship with Tatsuya himself, who became the target of the magic attack.

	With this amount of incoming data, searching in the information dimension for Tatsuya will not be a difficult task.

	The fact that he appeared here was the result of a feeling of concern for Miyuki that had come to him. This coincided with the search for Gu Jie, with the fact that he found a clue. That's why Tatsuya decided not to miss this opportunity, even if there is an additional risk involved.

	At the moment, the investigation of the terrorist attack, carried out by the Ten Master Clans, is at an impasse. Internal investigation by the Yotsuba also did not find any new clues, impatience grew. At least from Maya there was no news. Tatsuya himself had no desire to hurry. In truth, at first he wanted to leave the police investigating Gu Jie's connection with the anti-magical movement, but now decided that it was worth using a clue.

	For those who cannot use magic, it was as dangerous as a firearm or explosive. Roughly speaking, a magician can be considered an armed man. It is only natural that unarmed civilians will want to stay away from it. Such was the modern world.

	But one could not turn a blind eye to the fact that the anti-magical faction is under the control of an enemy magician. Moreover, these people were only pawns in his hands. Although there was not much difference, at least pawns, albeit allies, they were still enemies.

	Earlier, on the wrist of a humanist shooting fireballs, was a white bracelet, with a red and blue edges. Tatsuya knew that this was a sign of a member of Egalit, a subordinate organization of the anti-magical international organization Blanche.

	Behind the "Blanche" was Zhou Gunjin, and Zhou Gunjin's boss was Gu Jie. This information Tatsuya learned from different sources. That is, if you hold the line of command from the very bottom, you will see that Egalit's members were under the command of Gu Jie from the very beginning. Nevertheless, members of such organizations like Egalit were recruited by people with anti-magical moods, and received brainwashing for more total control. Even the "leader" of this group seems to be shouting gravely anti-magic slogans, it was not like an acting game.

	In the end, they were all deceived. Most likely, even about the properties of "printing" in the form of a tattoo on his hands, he was not aware. Having in the arsenal of firearms and magic, such a crowd was sent to attack Miyuki. From now on, it became Tatsuya's concern. Until he catches Gu Jie, Miyuki will be in constant danger. During the assignment, there will inevitably be a time when he will have to be at a distance from Miyuki. When dealing with terrorists, you should be afraid of retaliatory attacks on your relatives. It will not be sarcastic to say that such situations arise not only with terrorists, but also during civil and international wars, as well as in the fight against criminal groups. The fundamental difference between war and terror is a ban on attacking civilian and other non-combatable targets. In our time there are clear rules of war,

	It all depends on whether the rules are observed or not.

	Therefore, Tatsuya simply could not leave the pursuit of Gu Jie. As long as Miyuki is in danger. In the end, he decided, found and stopped Gu Jie with the maximum possible speed. It's decided.

	He divided his consciousness in half and assigned one half the task of searching the ocean for information, leaving the second half to the observation of Miyuki.

	The information is accompanied by events. If an event occurred changing anything, the "change" record will be left in the information dimension. Magic can also be called "the technique of changing information." Any manipulation of information remains in the information dimension as an "event" record. We take for the original data "DS was used" and "print, drawn with transparent ink" is used, and we get a blurred information trace.

	"... what is it?"

	Information about the enemy magician appeared in the eyes Tatsuya.

	"This is not Gu Jie, but ..."

	The informational body of the magician did not coincide with the image of Gu Jie, which he saw in Zama. If it was him, then right from here Tatsuya would use "Mist dispersion" and wipe it into dust. While the goal is fixed by a "glance" through the information dimension, the physical distance does not matter.

	"Is it possible to obtain more detailed information by raising the limit of clarity of the" look "?"

	Tatsuya read the data on the remote magician bit by bit. The name of Oumi Kazuki, specialization "puppeteer", the current location of Kamakura ...

	"Here it is!"

	Suddenly, serious changes occurred in the information body he watched. To avoid a possible magical counterattack, he reflexively turned off the eyes. The review switched to normal sight. The distance to the policeman who fled to him almost did not change from the moment of entering the information dimension. Less than one second passed.

	"That is, he was killed right after I canceled the magic?"

	The content of the data change was the transition from a living state to a non-living state. When Tatsuya began to track information, it was ten or more seconds after he destroyed the magic of the violet flame. At the time of the destruction of the seal, someone was near the magician. Tatsuya thought, was it a coincidence that the murder happened at the time of the "review" of the goal. One option was that the enemy has a technique for detecting surveillance. Another option was that the enemy could know about the eyes and simply killed the comrade out of caution.

	"What a difficult opponent ..."

	Tatsuya sighed, at the same time raising his hands and showing the policeman that he was not going to resist. At this point, you need to solve the current problems, thought Tatsuya.



	 ◊ ◊ ◊



	 Not paying attention to the corpse of the owner of the house of Oumi Kazuki, Gu Jie reflected on the current situation. He killed his comrade-in-arms, the user of ancient magic, only because he saw signs of feedback on the DC control channel. He did not know what kind of technique, but he felt a clear murderous intention from the point of connection with the spirit. The murder was supposed to cut off the communication route, but Gu Jie did not know if it helped against enemy equipment.

	"Although I counterattacked, there was the possibility that they learned about this place," Gu Jie thought.

	What he felt was Tatsuya's eyes. Gu Jie did not know that this is just a way of extracting information without an attacking effect. However, Gu Jie's ability to feel the danger that helped him survive the last 50 years, instantly smelled observation through the information dimension. Now he felt a strong enmity towards himself.

	- Initially, I needed another day. Gu Jie glanced toward the next room, where there were two human bodies. One of these bodies had a potential that he had never before possessed. He thought it would be a great loss if you left it here. It takes only one day to make a "generator of death" instead of a "soldier of death" (not a soldier ready to die, but literally a "dead soldier"), so that you can use it longer.

	"How wasteful ... Is it not stupid to be so greedy?" Shaking his head, as if discarding regrets, Gu Jie went into the next room with a ceremonial dagger, which he had just killed his companion and friend.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	 "I look so, that I'd rather die ..." - Izumi did not try to hide her mood from adults, making a sullen look. There was no need to pretend, since she was really depressed.

	- ... means, other than the defensive barrier Sakurai-san, the other magic was not used?

	- Yes. - Shortly responded Izumi to the question of the teacher of 1B class.

	Is it true that the other side used "interference"? - Asked Deputy Director Yaosak.

	- Yes. - Again, briefly and firmly answered Izumi. Four adults, including the director and his deputy, began to discuss something lively.

	"What a headache, why should I report here." - Mentally expressed her dissatisfaction with Izumi. Although she herself was the one who created this situation. Just knowing what has happened will continue to warm up the anger in the depths of her consciousness. Schoolgirls coveted a crowd of men. Not surprisingly, the director and deputy director reacted so violently when they learned that the incident could result in trauma. It is clear that she was interrogated now as one of the sides of the incident. She was tormented by the question of why she was the only one here. Theoretically, she knew the answer. That this situation is inevitable.

	The other side had an Antinite, a rare military resource. Confirmed its use as a weapon for the purpose of causing harm to health. Antinite is a well-known method of countering magicians, designed to block their magic and allow time to inflict physical damage. This kind of incident no longer falls under simple hooliganism and simple answers to questions from the police do not get off. Not only the attackers, but also the victims were taken to the police station. And because of the seriousness of the incident, it was necessary to inform the school administration immediately. Someone had to go there.

	Minami was asked to go to the station as using the magic barrier, Tatsuya was taken to interview as a person who used force allegedly for self-defense. Although Miyuki did not use explicit magic, the sensors showed a large number of psion emissions.

	By the method of exclusion Izumi was chosen the one who will go to school and notify the teachers. Izumi understood this. But as they often say, mind and emotions are two different things.

	- Saegusa-kun. - Said the director Momoyama, who was silent until then.

	- Yes. "He answered Izumi with a slightly restless voice.

	- Did the attackers change their behavior after they identified you and Shiba-kun?

	Izumi, feeling the pressure of the stern look of the director, spoke in a monotonous voice.

	- And really, director. They saw me and said "She is from the Saegusa family," they named Shiba president "the president of the Student Council of First High," and after these words they went to our side.

	- In other words, the previous incidents of attacks on the first year were only a search for higher priorities.

	- I think so too.

	"Hmmm ..." Momoyama pondered, folding his arms over the sleeves of his kimono. Izumi did not dare to show impatience and waited for the director to continue. Even for the rest of the adults, it was difficult to withstand the pressure of his silence.

	- Director. Yaosaka interrupted the silence. Momoyama, not showing any concern that he was interrupted, looked at Yaosaku.

	- Vice president. Temporarily close the school from tomorrow. For now, let it be until Saturday, the 23rd.

	"Director, so suddenly closed school ..." Yaosaka suddenly tried to object to such an unexpected decision. But then he shrank with a face expressing "damn well I got", although the expected spree from Momoyama was not followed.

	- What is the reason for closing?

	"Ah, yes, that's ..." Instead of answering Yaosaku, a look that contained "do not you understand?"

	- Before that, our students were subjected to simple pursuit, without the use of force. - He began explaining Momoyama. He seemed to like talking in a teacher's tone. "But now it looks like they decided to move to more active actions against our students." I believe that this is not a random incident, the probability of a planned systematic attack is quite high.

	- Organized crime?

	Yaosaka was not the only one who turned pale. Teachers of the first year of training, present here, and Izumi also felt the blood drain from his face.

	- Since this is not a simple crowd, it is expected that things can get much worse. It is necessary to observe the situation for a while.

	"Hmm ... yes, I think that's the best way."

	"Leave the formalities on me."

	After sending Yaosaki with an order, Momoyama turned to Izumi.

	"Saegusa-kun, you've had a rough day."

	Hearing these words, Izumi regarded them as a permission to leave.

	- Yes, really ... - She wanted to leave this place as quickly as possible and decided to seize this opportunity.

	"Then, director, I beg your pardon ..." She bowed cautiously and turned to the exit.



	 ◊ ◊ ◊



	 After the situation in the police station was over, and Tatsuya and the girls returned home, it was already more than seven in the evening. The police had many questions, so they returned home so late. Motorcycle Tatsuya took a traffic police officer. The policeman noticed that Tatsuya's motorcycle was completely bullet-proof (even tires and a windshield), but did not ask any questions, apparently he was aware of Tatsuya's personality. Personal belongings of Miyuki and Minami were left in the locker at the school. But things will not go away and will not deteriorate, so they decided to pick them up when they come to school tomorrow, and now stay home.

	Tatsuya decided to drop the clue that was obtained by the discovery of the magic operator, but he already had one idea on this subject. In any case, today they were going to rest, but before they could take off their shoes at the entrance, an unexpected message arrived. Tatsuya quickly changed the military street clothes to a domestic one, and was already looking at the screen of the mobile terminal, sitting on the sofa in the living room, when Miyuki, disguised, came down from her room.

	"... Onii-sama." You have a very terrible face. Did you get any bad news?

	- No, nothing like that. "He looked at Miyuki and answered her, pointing to a seat beside him. Miyuki sat down at the indicated place, and glanced at the terminal screen, which he tipped toward her.

	"Tatsuya-sama, Miyuki-sama, your tea." - Minami in apron over the form, went into the living room, carrying them tea. On the tray was green tea, brewed at the request of Tatsuya. Putting the cup on the table, Minami asked with her eyes if there were any new orders for her.

	- Wait a bit. "Answering Minami, Tatsuya turned to Miyuki. She just finished reading the message and looked up at her brother.

	"Onii-sama, this ... I cannot even refuse."

	- Clear. Tatsuya sighed slightly and turned to Minami's waiting orders.

	"Having finished my tea, Miyuki and I are about to leave." We'll eat outside the house, so, Minami, you can be free. You can use your free time on your own.

	Miyuki thought that his brother's explanation was incomplete.

	- I was invited to a meeting with the new head of the family Juumonji. "She said before Minami reacted to Tatsuya's words.

	"As you wish." - Minami's answer would not have changed, regardless of the number of explanations. She bowed gracefully to her mistress and master.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	 Although Miyuki told Minami that she was "invited by the Juumonji family," even this was not a sufficient explanation. Tatsuya and Miyuki waited not only for Katsuto, but for Mayumi and Masaki. It was an invitation to an ordinary daily meeting at the same place as before.

	Miyuki looked a little scattered, entering a larger building, similar to a mansion. Earlier Tatsuya contacted Katsuto and said that he would miss the meeting today. It was already 8 pm, at this time they usually had a so-called dinner after the meeting. Katsuto, Mayumi and Masaki met Tatsuya and Miyuki with serious faces.

	- I'm sorry for the delay.

	"Sorry for the urgent call." Sit down. - In response to Tatsuya's official tone, Katsuto spoke in a serious voice, with a slight tinge of guilt. At the table, three people were already sitting and waiting for the others to arrive. Katsuto sat at the head of the table, with Mayumi and Masaki sitting on one side of the table. Perhaps because it was a French restaurant, and they were sitting at a western table, their etiquette did not seem to care. Tatsuya landed Miyuki opposite Mayumi, and sat down opposite Masaki.

	"Shiba-san, are you all right?" - Asked Masaki sat down Miyuki.

	- Yes. As a result, nothing happened. Thank you for your concern. - Smiling, Miyuki answered him. Masaki's face flushed, but he still breathed a sigh of relief. He was seriously worried about Miyuki. At least that's how Katsuto and Mayumi understood Masaki's reaction.

	"Shiba, what happened today is a disaster." - Instead of rebuking Masaki, Katsuto turned to Tatsuya.

	- Really. This we did not expect. - Tatsuya honestly admitted that he was also not ready for such a scenario.

	"Did the enemy have a pistol, and he also used attack magic?" - With anxiety asked Mayumi.

	- Member of the anti-magical movement used magic? Or did the enemy magician pretend to be a "humanist"? - Directly asked Masaki.

	Tatsuya did not answer Masaki, but spoke directly with Katsuto in the form of a report.

	"The man who was used as the point of transfer of magic was a member of Egalit, a branch of Blanche."

	"Blanche?" - Surprised Katsuto raised his eyebrows. "Did not we destroy their forces in Japan?"

	"The remnants apparently went underground."

	"Hmm ..." Crossed his arms, Katsuto considered Tatsuya's words. He did not show disbelief. The Juumonji family also participated in the "Incident with the sweeping of the Japanese branch of Blanche." Apparently Katsuto believed that he completely got rid of Blanche and Egalit.

	"Tatsuya-kun, what is the point of transmission of magic?" - Mayumi did not participate in that sweep, so she was interested in another place in Tatsuya's words.

	- A member of Egalit, who headed that crowd, was not a magician. A certain operator of ancient magic used this person as the point of transfer of magic, somehow ordering "to use it" for remote control of magic.

	"Is this even possible?" - Mayumi seemed to be very surprised. The method of installing a remote point of magic was used in full in ancient magic, but in modern times it was a rarity. No wonder she was not aware of this.

	- Omitting the details, the point of transfer of magic is created through a magical "label", previously activated by magic. There is a magic that does not require the purpose of exposure, it simply radiates heat or sound or magical "bullets". A good choice as an attacking magic. In our case, there was a call to the DS, which attacks in all directions indiscriminately.

	"That is, the enemy is the operator of ancient magic?" Do you know who exactly? - Asked Masaki, to which Mayumi said "Hey! ~". Tatsuya could not admit out loud that he had finally heard the most useful question.

	- I wrote down the sequence of activation of that magic. A check is currently in progress. "Until Tatsuya decided not to tell the truth." The fact that he is looking for the culprit was not a lie. Although he already knew the name and address, it was not Gu Jie, so he considered this information useless. What clues can be obtained from the magician of ancient magic, Oumi Kazuki? Connections around the country, places he visited, people he met. Which organization belonged to. There was nothing that could lead to Gu Jie. He must have already left the house of Oumi, but he could have left a mark. This case was transferred to Ayako and Yuka, and Tatsuya was waiting for news from them. He called Fumiya, because Tsukuba specialized in the magic of Mental Intervention, which could help the Kurobaa in their investigation.

	"Did you record the sequence?" How the hell ...

	The activation sequence is a program inside CAD, which is an electronic version of the sequence of magic. Recording sequences of magic - the existing technology, there is nothing impossible. However, in modern magic, it is also possible to observe the application of magic directly in battle, to see the magical processes constructing it, and to record them if required. Not surprisingly, Masaki asked this question.

	"... no, I'm just on my nerves." I apologize. - Masaki did not wait for an answer and bowed, apologizing. Among magicians, it is considered a bad form to be interested in the secrets of rivals. Masaki instantly realized the error and corrected himself before he heard reproaches from interlocutors.

	- Nothing wrong. But I hope that you will promise to keep it a secret.

	- Naturally. So, Shiba, when will we get the results of the check?

	Tatsuya, smiling, accepted an apology, and Katsuto translated the conversation to the main topic. Removing the smile, Tatsuya looked at Katsuto.

	- I think the results will be tomorrow. We will inform sempais as soon as we find a clue. Of course, Ichijo also.

	- Have agreed. I entrust this to the Yotsuba family.

	Neither Mayumi nor Masaki disputed Katsuto's decision. Instead, Mayumi watched Katsuto turn to face Miyuki.

	"Miyuki-san, today you had a hard day." First of all, it's good that no one was hurt.

	- Thank you very much for your concern. Miyuki bowed slightly, waiting for further words. It was unnecessary to say that Mayumi was talking about something else.

	- I heard from my sister that these "humanists" aimed directly at Miyuki-san?

	Under the sister, she meant Izumi, by itself. Apparently she did not fully explain what had happened, so Miyuki decided to make corrections.

	- No, initially they attacked other students, but when they noticed us, they changed their purpose.

	- All the same, it seems they knew in advance about Miyuki-san.

	Mayumi wanted to say that they "knew that Miyuki was the heiress of the Yotsuba family." Miyuki waved her head in denial.

	- It seems that I was known to them only as "President of the school board of First High."

	The only mention of the Ten Master Clans was when in Izumi the crowd recognized a member of the Saegusa family.

	- In any case, the "humanists" after all, regardless of the original goal, attacked Shiba-san? - Masaki intervened in the conversation.

	- We also think so. "Mayumi sharply stated, beating ahead of Miyuki's and Tatsuya's objections." "That's why Miyuki-san, will you allow me to add additional security to you?"

	Miyuki was embarrassed by the proposal of Mayumi.

	"A bodyguard?" But I...

	I have Onii-sama, she wanted to say, but she began to realize that this was not the case. At the moment, Tatsuya is on a quest to find Gu Jie and he can leave for a long time. Although Tatsuya protects Miyuki from any distance, watching her with his "vision", this ability is a secret and cannot be disclosed to outsiders. Mayumi cannot be persuaded if he does not disclose the details of Tatsuya's abilities. Today they were lucky because of Tatsuya's premonition that he appeared on the spot and solved the problem without magic.

	"Is this to catch the enemy who planned today's attack on Miyuki?"

	Tatsuya's heavy voice made Miyuki feel uncomfortable. Tatsuya looked in turn at Katsuto and Mayumi, and stopped to look at Masaki.

	- Ichijo. Do you plan to use Miyuki as a bait?

	- Of course not! - Masaki quickly responded in an agitated voice. "I would never do that." If you need a bait, take me!

	Masaki's words showed no deception, but Tatsuya's eyes remained sharp.

	"I do not deny the bait plan itself."

	Masaki showed a face that expressed "that's hell."

	- Was it Kichijouji's idea?



	Masaki could not object to him, because he was in the top ten. Indeed, it was Ichijo's plan to use as a bait.

	Ignoring the tense atmosphere, Katsuto broke the silence.

	- The next head of Yotsuba cannot be left unaccompanied, as for terrorists it will be a tasty morsel. Of course, I want to take a chance to catch a clue in the search for Gu Jie.

	Everyone realized that under the "next head of Yotsuba" Katsuto meant Miyuki. He realized that Tatsuya's charge did not contain malicious intent.

	- But this is not the main goal. The main task of the escort is to protect the next head. Shiba, Saegusa came up with this so you could focus on the investigation.

	Tatsuya looked at Mayumi. Their eyes met.

	- ...Clear. - said Tatsuya and softened his eyes. - Then I give up my previous words. I will organize protection by the forces of Yotsuba.

	This meant rejecting Mayumi's offer. Given her character, she wanted to protect Miyuki with all her heart, but she did not know that this was all her father's plan. It was more than just a defense.

	- That's how ... Given the situation of Miyuki-san, this is quite natural.

	"No, thank you for your concern." - Miyuki slightly bowed to Mayumi.

	Mayumi smiled and shook her head, seeing the familiar picture already.

	- Juumonji-senpai. Tatsuya spoke to Katsuto, looking from the girls. Hearing Tatsuya's voice, Katsuto's gaze invited me to continue.

	"After all, I am the only one who used physical violence in that incident," humanists "suffered from my hands. If you need bait, why not use me?

	But the first responded Mayumi, not Katsuto.

	- Hyena will not go against the lion. Because he can attack in return, and it hurts.

	- In addition, the bait should be an easy prey, and not a bunch of complex tests.

	Katsuto caught Mayumi's rush and added his argument.

	- Juumonji-kun. Do you really plan to make Miyuki-san a bait?

	- Saegusa. Do not talk about it as someone else's business. Not only the next head of Yotsuba is the goal of the anti-magical movement. You, as the eldest daughter of the Saegusa family, can also become a target.

	Puzzled, Mayumi looked at him and clapped her eyes.

	"In today's incident ..." Miyuki said, Mayumi, who had lost her gift of speech. - I was not the only goal of humanists. I just heard them pointing at Izumi-chan and pronounced "She is from the Saegusa family".

	Miyuki did not aspire to catch a spectacular moment to speak out, it came out by accident. The views of the three guys stopped at Mayumi.

	"... Er, I?" Mayumi looked at the others with a frightened face.

	- Saegusa. Where is your guard?

	"I'm all right." I can stand up for myself.

	Katsuto shook his head.

	- Saegusa-senpai does not want to be protected?

	- Clear. Katsuto's voice followed Tatsuya's words, but this time he nodded.

	"Hey, I'm telling you it's all right."

	- I do not doubt the skill of Saegusa, but in an emergency situation it may take more.

	"It's not a reason to use the guards!"

	- True? I remember seeing some strange shadow next to the university ...

	- Strangers are not allowed into the territory of the campus!

	Apparently, the guards of the Saegusa family for Miyuki managed to escape. Watching Katsuto with Mayumi, Tatsuya and Miyuki thought so.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	While Tatsuya and the others were already finishing the meeting, Kokonoye Yakumo received an unexpected guest. Yakumo was sitting at the end of the room, wearing an ordinary monk's robe. Being a self-named hermit, he was an opponent of luxury. The guest was like a foreigner. Although the old age was felt, the width of the shoulders showed developed musculature. Sitting opposite him, Yakumo felt young and insignificant. The head of this man was also clean-shaven "under the monk." He was dressed in an expensive luxury brand suit. The suit suited him perfectly. It was a habit to wear expensive things. There was a feeling that luxury, symbolized by tailored high-end costume, seeped from the inside.

	From under the gray, dense eyebrows, I could see a sharp look. He expressed his majesty with his face. However, the white, muddy left eye caused a strange feeling of oppression. The impression of heterogeneity should also be largely conditioned by this left eye.

	- His Excellency visited this modest nameless temple ... What kind of wind could bring such a turn of events? - Yakumo slowly set before the guest a cup of tea. The guest took a cup, took one sip and put it back. Although this way of drinking ignored the rules of tea ceremonies, the guest was not intended to show his impoliteness.

	- Anonymous temple? Your modesty sounds like tasteless sarcasm, Kokonee Yakumo.

	"Forgive me for being rude." - Cunningly looking at the one whom he called "His Excellency," Yakumo answered him.

	"I do not think that the chief priest of some nameless church could talk like this to me, Todo Aoba."

	- Oh, you do not like it?

	- No. I rather liked it. - Elder Todo took a cup, and finished his tea. - I want more.

	Yakumo smiled and took the cup. He boiled water on a wood stove with a hood (it fitted the interior of the room and was also used for heating in winter), and making tea, spoke in a relaxed voice.

	"So, Your Excellency, what business do you have for us today?"

	Yakumo brewed green tea, but instead of putting the cup in front of Elder Todo, he raised his head and spoke.

	"You came last month." Why should I be obliged to see the face of the commander so soon again?

	"Last month," Yakumo was the 4th of January. Then Tatsuya and Miyuki visited the temple and the person, because of whom they had to wait, was the one who was sitting in front of Yakumo.

	- Kokonee Yakumo, I want to lend your power. - The answer of Elder Todo was simple and informative.

	- What can a simple Buddhist monk serve His Excellency?

	"Stop yelling." Your magic, perhaps, confirms the reincarnation of Kasinkodzi, if you do not help, then no one can.

	[note. trans.: Kasinkodzi - a myth about a ninja who lived around the 16th and 17th century, and publicly showed some magical tricks.]

	- Hmm. It is said that Kasinkodzi was most likely an ordinary magician. Is it possible to use the term "reincarnation" - a little bit too much?

	- This myth came to us from times when magic was still considered an invention. It's useless to try to fool me. I know about your abilities.

	After thinking, Yakumo scratched his bald head.

	"... So, the elder." Giving you your strength for what? - Initially, Yakumo did not even think of escaping this old man. He was perfectly aware of who this old man was with a dull left eye.

	"Gu Jie, a magician from the continent, is walking loose, it's just unthinkable. The technique of using puppet corpses is disgusting. He uses it indiscriminately, you need to do something about it.

	"The Elder." For a simple monk, this will be difficult.

	- I'm not talking about the exorcism ceremony. You are required to stop desecration.

	"In other words, do you want to get rid of Gu Jie because of his joke?"

	Sigh Yakumo this time was not an acting game.

	"You just need to drive him out of Japan." It does not matter whether dead or alive.

	"If his Excellency asks, I cannot refuse."

	"I do not control those of Yotsuba anymore." Now I'm just a sponsor.

	Yakumo pretended not to hear the old man's words. Previously, this old man was the owner of the Fourth Magic Research Laboratory, and now he is simply sponsoring Yotsuba. Although you cannot say "just" sponsors. Yakumo knew this.

	- If this modest monk will put his hand, then in the main temple there will be a noise.

	This was not an excuse. Yakumo was sent to do dirty work, such was the reality. Nevertheless, there was no point in complaining to this old man Todo Aobe.

	"It's already been discussed at Mount Hiii."

	This old man clearly had power and connections to be able to influence the right people.

	"That's how it is ..."

	Yakumo often sighed today, it was for him an unusual behavior.

	"And yet, I do not expect much from you." I'm no longer in that position now.

	- First of all, try to specify something specific. Regardless of whether you think this is possible or not.

	For Yakumo it was a unique phenomenon to say such words. For example, Kudo Retsu was older than Todo Aoba, but even he could not refuse such a "request."

	"We need you to do this with Shiba Tatsuya's force."

	"... Did this boy take a liking to His Excellency?"

	"Though he appeared by chance, he is one of the best of its kind." I need him to be useful for some time.

	Yakumo felt compassion for Tatsuya. He understood that this old man looks at Tatsuya as a guinea pig trying to collect more useful data. He wants to get it in his hands. Yakumo believed that Tatsuya would be difficult to avoid this fate.

	In addition, Yakumo did not know that Tatsuya was already engaged in this business.

	"But is he suitable for such a thing as eliminating Gu Jie?"

	"I think it's worth not fearing the clash between Shiba Tatsuya and Gu Jie."

	- Are you worried about the possibility of a direct collision with the Stars?

	Yakumo also knew that a certain senior Star officer had recently infiltrated the territory of Japan. It was not known at what stage their investigation was, but one thing was clear - he was sent here to destroy Gu Jie with his own hands. They do not want Gu Jie to fall into the hands of the Japanese authorities. Perhaps there are facts about which the Japanese side should not know.

	If Tatsuya follows Gu Jie's trail, it's easy to predict that this representative of the Stars will one day rise in his path. Yakumo did not think that this is a situation where one must be at enmity.

	- Speaking of pure combat power, I think the second issue of Stars Benjamin "Canopus" Lowes will lose to Shiba Tatsuya-kun.

	- This is if there is a fight without rules.

	- Clear.

	Yakumo understood the anxiety of Elder Todo. He was worried about breaking the "rules". Todo Aoba tried to avoid getting "creating" Yotsuba on the battlefield, where victory and defeat is achieved not only by firepower.

	"I'd like to ask you to make sure that Shiba Tatsuya does not get into this situation."

	- And what about the search for Gu Jie?

	- If possible, take it alive, but do not take chances. After all, in any case, before him, sooner or later, the Stars will get.

	In other words, Gu Jie can also be killed by the Stars. They do not care about the reputation of the Ten Master Clans. For Elder Todo, it seemed to be a good decision if the Ten Master Clans get into a quandary.

	"If you say so, I do not mind." This humble monk and Shiba Tatsuya-kun will take care of this problem.

	"Thank you." Ten zabutonov as a payment suitable?

	[note. Zabuton is a Japanese cushion for sitting on the floor]

	"Zabuton" here was a code word among Japanese shadow entrepreneurs, and meant 10,000 banknotes of 10,000 yen, that is 100 million yen. 10 "pillows" meant 1 billion yen.

	Yakumo shook his head with a bitter smile.

	- No no. This humble monk is a hermit. There is no need for a material reward, like money.

	This time Todo shook his head.

	- The truth is that I have nothing more valuable. At least I think so. If you do not need money, how about a new Buddha statue that I recently bought, to replace your cracked one?

	The proposed statue was of pure gold.

	- Thank you for taking care of the temple.

	"I'll leave formalities for you." It sounds like a bargain.

	Todo stood up, his hand on his knee. This variant of getting up gave the aura of the old experienced man. A second later Yakumo got up, without making a sound.

	"Tea is usually not tasty, but today I'm pleased with the results of the visit."

	After these words, Todo, Yakumo smiled opened the sliding door.





	Chapter 12



	When Tatsuya and Miyuki returned home, it was ten o'clock in the evening. This time was not considered late for high school students. Minami, as expected, has not slept yet.

	- Welcome back. - Changed the clothes to the working (in other words, to the maid) Minami greeted Tatsuya with Miyuki at the front door.

	- We have returned. Did someone call or leave messages?

	After Tatsuya's question, Minami's face took on a mixed expression, with a hint of hesitation and embarrassment.

	"Since your departure, Kurobaa-sama and Tsukuba-sama have not been contacted."

	Tatsuya was waiting for the results of the search in the house of the magician, discovered by the feedback of the spell. But Minami's behavior said that there was a message from someone else.

	"You'll tell me in the living room."

	- As you wish.

	Tatsuya and Miyuki went into the living room and sat on the sofa, Minami stood in front of them and voiced the message received in their absence.

	"An urgent message came from First High.

	- Urgent?

	"Yes, Miyuki-sama." Although the content of the message is not something bad, but I felt it necessary to notify you about it today.

	- So, what's in the message?

	"They said the school was closed from tomorrow." Originally planned until Saturday the 23rd, but there is the possibility of increasing the duration.

	The brother and sister were very surprised at this news.

	"... So suddenly."

	- ... Recently in the Second High something similar happened. I quite understand why they went for this.

	Tatsuya as well as Miyuki, expressed surprise at what he heard. But putting forward this theory, he agreed with the leadership of the school.

	- I understand ... However, something worries me. - Miyuki put her hands to her cheeks and sighed slightly.

	- What happened?

	Miyuki, hearing the question of his brother, was slightly embarrassed, and looked him in the eyes.

	"After that incident, we went straight home from the police station ... Personal things were left in the school locker."

	From the behavior of Miyuki Tatsuya realized that she had left there something that others should not see.

	"I'll go to school tomorrow."

	Miyuki looked at Tatsuya in surprise.

	"But Onii-sama." Will the school be closed?

	"I think they'll let me go for a little while to pick up my personal belongings." You cannot give up an idea without trying.

	Miyuki did not say that there was something important.

	- I realized.

	But she was obviously worried. In the end, Miyuki insisted that she should go for things with Tatsuya.

	 Tatsuya stayed at home this night. He knew the place from which the control of the magic of spirits was carried out. Although the circumstances required action, Tatsuya's choice was different.

	"Miyuki, are you feeling any better?" "Towards midnight, when they were about to sleep, Tatsuya knocked on the door of Miyuki's room.

	- Oh yeah. Wait a bit.

	On the other side of the door came a confused voice. It was heard as Miyuki in a hurry is doing something.

	- I beg. Come in, Onii-sama.

	Before him appeared blushing Miyuki, apparently it was due to the fact that she was wearing only a robe on her naked body. However, the robe was not fastened. Perhaps it was because of haste.

	Despite the appearance of Miyuki, Tatsuya went into her room.

	"Please come in, sit down."

	"No, I'll stand here." Tatsuya did not go beyond the door.

	"Onii-sama?"

	- Miyuki. I'll probably say a strange thing now ...

	- Yes? Miyuki bowed her head in question. It was the brother's strange behavior and she was puzzled.

	"Can you get up early tomorrow?"

	"Why is Onii-sama so very interested in such a small thing ...?" - Reflecting on this, Miyuki automatically answered "Yes."

	- Yes. Let me clarify, what time do I have to get up tomorrow?

	Tatsuya's answer was within the expected.

	- Come to our underground laboratory at 4 o'clock.

	"... It's pretty early."

	"Yes, I'm sorry, but ..."

	- No, everything is okay!

	Realizing that she looked upset in her brother's eyes, she tried to change the impression of herself by rejecting words that sounded like a complaint. Her complaints were completely groundless, so she decided for herself.

	- Here's how. Tatsuya's gaze showed surprise for a moment. But quickly returned to his usual expressionless state.

	"Onii-sama, did you want something else?" Please, do not be shy, talk. "Miyuki noticed Tatsuya's hesitation, and asked straight.

	The dressing gown slightly opened, Tatsuya's eyes stopped on that convex place where there was no underwear at the moment. Realizing what he saw, he looked up sharply, and, restraining tension, answered.

	"Take a bath before you go to the lab." Or simply the soul will be enough, the main thing to be clean.

	- Good. Miyuki said in an elevated tone. Her heart was pounding in her chest, she tried to hide her concern from Tatsuya's words.

	- Be dressed in a robe and underwear, no, better swimsuit.

	Miyuki thought her heart was about to jump out of her chest.

	- Good. And ... this ... is there a CAD setting? - Miyuki suppressed the excitement and decided to clarify, as the visit to the laboratory was at an unplanned time.

	- No, it's different. Tatsuya said this, and looked away. Noticing this, Miyuki followed his gaze.

	"Onii-sama he was embarrassed?"

	"I'll tell you when you come." Sorry, I'm counting on you.

	Quickly, Tatsuya left Miyuki's room. As soon as the door closed, Miyuki sat on the floor. Hands, attached to the cheeks, felt the heat.

	Remembering that "I must get up at 3 o'clock in the morning," she sluggishly went to bed. Fearing lack of sleep, she forced herself to fall asleep quickly, showing herself an image of how she looked sleepy in front of her brother. Although perhaps she quickly disconnected because of the amount of excitement that has just taken away from her a lot of strength.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	After waking up at 3 o'clock in the morning, Miyuki washed herself, put on a new underwear, threw on her robe and tied a belt. Tatsuya said "swimsuit", but it seemed to her that this linen would do.

	Sitting in front of the mirror, she combed her hair for a long time. Her hair was not tangled, the comb easily passed them the first time. The look stopped on cosmetics, but in the end she decided to go without make-up. She thought that her brother did not need it. Also fragrant shampoo was used. There were no more ideas how to improve your image.

	So Miyuki understood Tatsuya's words "you must be clean."



	At 4 o'clock Miyuki went to the underground laboratory. This was the room where she conducted the first flight test flight.

	"It's Miyuki."

	"Come in."

	Miyuki took a deep breath and opened the door to the lab. Going inside, she stopped suddenly. It was because of Tatsuya's appearance. He was wearing only tight trunks.

	In this room it was warmer than in the other rooms of the house. Perhaps the temperature was adjusted so specifically to match bathing suits.

	Only a moment Miyuki felt indecisive.

	She unbuttoned her belt, and the robe, slipping on the body, fell to the floor.

	Now it was Tatsuya's turn to be fascinated by what he saw. At first he expected that under the robe would be a one-piece closed swimsuit.

	But in reality.

	Closing only a small part of the skin, she was wearing a white bra and panties, decorated with lots of lace.

	Black or red color would look sexy, but here was used white, which caused the impression of elegance.

	Of course, the atmosphere itself was created not only by linen, but also by its owner.

	"... Onii-sama."

	Blushing Miyuki (if you look closely, the red face was not only the face, but also the neck and chest top) looked down and spoke to Tatsuya.

	"Please tell me ..."

	Even if she is now ordered to "take off all the underwear," she will not dare to object. Her voice exuded readiness for everything.

	"... Before we get to the main topic, listen to me a little."

	- ...Good.

	They stood about two meters apart when Tatsuya spoke.

	"As you know, my "eye" does not have the function of clairvoyance. This ability does not automatically find and show everything I want to know, but requires a selective approach based on cause-effect relationships to find the required information.

	- I believe that this is a great ability, able to reliably read the information to which to aim.

	Miyuki praised her brother, but he did not change his tone.

	- Of course, this requires a lot of time and effort, but the probability of obtaining a result is higher than with complete care in the subconscious. However, in order to go deeper into the genealogical tree of causality, clairvoyance is required, and more resources are needed for it.

	- Magical resources?

	- Attention, concentration, patience, multifaceted thinking ... they can be achieved without magic, but there will be no inconvenience if they turn out to be "magical resources".

	- Yes, I understand that. "Listening to Tatsuya's story, Miyuki looked at him. Seeing the enthusiasm in her eyes, Tatsuya nodded and continued the story.

	- I'm not talking about the theory as a whole, it's about the current mission. eyes I saw Gu Jie in Zama. Since then, there has been no information where he hides, but even without a causal relationship, only with the information obtained at the very beginning, it is possible to find it. But this is only possible if you provide yourself with enough resources.

	- Not enough magical resources? Can I help you?

	- No, by using all my resources, I can find a person anywhere in the country according to his informational body. And even 100% of the resources will not be used. According to my calculations, 70% of the resources allocated for the "Elemental Eye" are required.

	Hearing this, Miyuki frowned. But less than 5 seconds later she opened her eyes wide.

	- Is it because of the resources that are involved in my defense !?

	Tatsuya nodded with a bitter look.

	- I constantly use half of my resources "Elemental Eye" for watching you.

	Regardless of the distance, Tatsuya's magic will always eliminate any threat to Miyuki.

	No one can hurt her, because he always "sees" her.

	Constantly, 24 hours a day, without interruptions. Of course, when he sleeps, he does not use any magic. Nevertheless, observation works in the unconscious area of the mind even during sleep. He continues to "see." If danger threatens Miyuki, he is sure that he will immediately wake up, no matter how hard he would have slept. No, the word "sure" does not fit here, it's a system that works 100%.

	But the system may fail due to a lack of resources. Now was just such a situation.

	- Oni-sama, free up the resources that fall on me right now! I'm near. So do not watch me with the "Elemental Eye"!

	Miyuki, of course, spoke, following her character. Her words meant for Tatsuya the refusal of the duties of the guard. If it was not she, he might have agreed.

	- But Tatsuya shook his head. I cannot do it.

	- Why? There are no enemies here. This room is a dungeon with thick walls, it's hard to reach even for magic place. Even if magic is applied, it will be detected by multiple sensors, which you use here for experiments. Oh, this Onii-sama must understand better than me.

	- Exactly because of this reason.

	Miyuki looked at Tatsuya, and his confused look only added question marks over her head.

	"It's true, but ... I cannot do it because of my emotional problem."

	Miyuki held her breath. The question marks in her subconscious were replaced by exclamation marks.

	- Miyuki. I am very worried about the opportunity to remove your eyes from you. I'm afraid that having removed the eyes even for a hundredth of a second, and not knowing that you are all right ... I can go crazy.

	- Onii-sama ...

	Miyuki barely found the strength to say it. The only real feeling that Tatsuya can experience is love for her younger sister Miyuki. This Miyuki heard earlier from her mother.

	But now was the first time she heard the same thing directly from Tatsuya, also with details that he could go mad with love.

	"The theory is known to me." Even if you remove the eyes, I will be there and if something happens, I'll notice it. If you let go of surveillance, you are no longer so weak and defenseless as before. You have grown since then, since Okinawa. I understand it.

	Tatsuya tore his eyes from Miyuki and sighed with a self-reproached face.

	"However, feelings and theory are two different things. If you leave Gu Jie, like today's incident will happen again. As a result, the risk of injury will only increase. To move forward in this situation, I understand that I should concentrate the "Elemental Eye" on Gu Jie, but my feelings interfere with me.

	Tatsuya pointed to his heart with the thumb of his right hand, and shook his head, indicating that he was in turmoil.

	- I think I first realized that emotions are such a troublesome thing.

	Miyuki jerked to Tatsuya and grabbed his right hand, pressing against her.

	"Is there anything I can do for you?"

	Their eyes met.

	Tatsuya's eyes looked into Miyuki's eyes.

	- Oh yes. Miyuki, please help me.

	- Yes, anything, anything!

	It seems at this moment Miyuki completely forgot about the shame.

	Tatsuya, it seems, was a little embarrassed.

	"The fact that I cannot take your eyes off you was just one of the answers.

	Understanding Miyuki's suggestion to continue, Tatsuya overcame his embarrassment and spoke.

	"I'm afraid I cannot understand if you're safe."

	"... But, Onii-sama." Miyuki's here.

	Miyuki still could not understand Tatsuya's words about his "eye."

	- What can be seen with ordinary vision is only light and shadow.

	It was useless. What does Tatsuya see as a eyes? Apart from himself, no one knows this.

	- Those who see the world only with the naked eye, will not experience problems, seeing only light and shadow. But I always saw you with a "eye."

	Super-perception Tatsuya can read information much greater than the signal received through the main five senses.

	This super-perception, sometimes called the "eye of the spirits," Tatsuya always targets Miyuki. For Tatsuya Miyuki - a much more information-rich entity than other people, objects, landscapes, information about which is covered only by five senses.

	For Tatsuya, people other than Miyuki look like pathetic shadows, like ancient rock carvings on a cave wall.

	- By observing with simple vision, after seeing the eyes, I will not feel that you are safe. This prevents the release of resources.

	Tatsuya put his left hand to Miyuki's hand, which she grabbed at his right hand.

	"Therefore, Miyuki." Help me to be calm.

	Miyuki, focused on Tatsuya, did not notice herself nodding.



	Tatsuya, still in some swimming trunks, was sitting on the floor in the center of the laboratory. It was not the pose of a lotus or half-lotus, but simply a relaxed sitting with legs crossed. No, we will not be misleading that he "just" was sitting. Because dressed only in lacy lingerie Miyuki was sitting at his feet, with his back to him. Tatsuya's hands stretched to the left and right of Miyuki's body, holding Miyuki's left hand with his right hand and Miyuki's right hand with his left hand. It's as if he announced "I will never let you go."

	The skin of Miyuki blushed slightly not only on her face, but also on her whole body, to her feet. The fact that she was not "red as a ripe tomato" may have been the ability to maintain an exquisite balance between excitement and stress. But still it seemed from the side that she was not well.

	- Miyuki. Tatsuya called her name, speaking right next to her ear. Warm breath tickled the ear lobe. "Please release more power."

	In response to Tatsuya's words, Miyuki strongly squeezed his hands.

	"N-I cannot ...!" Miyuki groaned loudly. Almost screamed, but the breath that was knocked down did not let me speak normally.

	These hands are big, masculine.

	Hands tightly embraced her body.

	With her back, she felt the warmth of the body of a man who is her elder brother and fiancé.

	She could not understand, the quick heartbeat that she felt was Tatsuya or her own. For Miyuki this was indistinguishable at the moment.

	"It seems you're a bit overheated." Calm down.

	Miyuki was embarrassed to death. She wanted to hide her face in her hands, but they were both busy. At least he saved that he would not see her face, because she was sitting with her back to him.

	But that did not mean that she was uncomfortable. Rather, she was glad that she was hugged in this way.

	That's why she was embarrassed.

	"Not that I wanted to do something" obscene ... "

	Miyuki was desperate to convince herself. For the pupil of the second year of the senior school, her knowledge in this area was rather meager, because she was brought up in isolation, but undoubtedly, some knowledge was already available.

	In a half-naked form, alone with the opposite sex. The situation was on the edge, but that's all. Only a hug from behind.

	Tatsuya's hands hold Miyuki's hands.

	The hands of Miyuki hold Tatsuya's hands

	Between them there is not even a hint of affection.

	But still...

	"My mind seems to melt simultaneously with the body ..."

	In order not to faint, she could not even stop thinking, no matter how hard she tried.

	Suddenly Tatsuya's quiet voice penetrated Miyuki's ear.

	- Your tender skin, the warmth of your body, are felt even with your eyes closed. You are now really in my hands.

	- I'm here. Onii-sama will protect me. - The answer broke without thinking.



	"Therefore, Onii-sama ..."

	"... not worrying about anything ..."

	"... feel free to choose ..."

	- ... use the full power of Onii-sama ...

	Maybe it was something like a trance state. Like a holy maiden speaking from heaven, or as mediums or shamans, when talking to gods. Miyuki's words launched Tatsuya's "strength." The resources responsible for it were released. eyes Tatsuya swept across the sea of information in search of answers. All cause and effect relationships in the giant "tree" were viewed in an instant.

	Finally, he noticed the enemy's track.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Responsible for the attack in Hakone, a native of the former Dahan, manipulator of corpses, illegal migrant, magician of ancient magic, Gu Jie, woke up, feeling a sudden stabbing gaze.

	He did not understand where they looked from. They did not look from the room, nor from the whole building. The look was as if from another world, as if looked from underworld.

	Before the enemy could identify his identity, Gu Jie used a blocking curse to block an enemy spell.

	This magic was the development of the Kunlunfang Institute, and was obtained by the study of the ancient magic of interaction with the stars, in particular with the Dipper Bucket. It was intended for limited protection of DS from modern magic. He did not know how long she could restrain the enemy, and what would happen if the enemy appeared on the line of sight.

	But the next moment he fell under the psion pressure that tore his defensive spell. Gu Jie tried to quickly build a new protective spell. He held his breath.

	The next attack was not followed. Breathing hard, but mentally appreciated the damage. There is no pain anywhere, the magic of preserving youth is not damaged.

	As Gu Jie tried to investigate himself, he could not understand how much damage he had received by the previous attack. There was no sign that it was magic with activation delay. It was very scary to realize that he did not understand what was happening now. But there was no doubt that this place became known to the enemy. He decided to run away now.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Miyuki came to herself, sensing the signs of strong magic from Tatsuya's body. Before she could get her embarrassment back, Tatsuya freed her hands and let her go. Miyuki quickly got up, taking care that her brother was not uncomfortable.

	Feeling with her back that Tatsuya also rose, Miyuki stopped. However, the expected embrace did not happen, Tatsuya avoided it.

	Going to the door, he stopped. Miyuki looked at him in the back, he spoke without turning around.

	"Thank you, Miyuki."

	Miyuki shivered with all her body, and not because of the cold.

	"Was Miyuki useful?" - She asked in a joyful voice.

	- Oh sure. - Tatsuya turned around, there was a smile on his face. "Let's get dressed and I'll tell you more."

	Miyuki finally recovering, with a bright red face, and covering her chest with her hands, sat down on the floor. Tatsuya turned around and left the laboratory.



	Although it was the fifth hour of the morning, she could not bring herself to sleep. Although she was sweating a little, she decided to take a shower after Tatsuya's story, so she was dressed in a robe, not in school uniform. When she came to the dining room, Tatsuya was waiting for her at the table in training clothes.

	"Good morning, Miyuki-sama."

	"Good, Minami-chan."

	Yes, here was also Minami, dressed in a maid costume, which meant high professional skills.

	"Would you like some tea?"

	- Yes thank you.

	Before Miyuki, who sat opposite Tatsuya, hot tea was already standing. The refreshing taste of tea cheered her and drove her sleepiness away.

	"Minami, that's all." Rest a little.

	"As you wish, Tatsuya-sama."

	She bowed and left the dining room. She realized that it was not care for her, but a hint that the conversation would be private. Waiting until Minami came out, Tatsuya looked at Miyuki.

	- Miyuki.

	- Yes, Onii-sama.

	Miyuki stretched out over the string, and tensed. The memory of direct contact with the skin Tatsuya surfaced in her mind. Her response was uttered in a tongue-tied tongue.

	"I'm sorry for what happened."

	However, seeing the care of Tatsuya about herself, Miyuki relaxed.

	- ... To be useful to Onii-sama ... no, to belong to Onii-sama is happiness for Miyuki.

	Miyuki shook her head with a happy smile.

	"Moreover, Onii-sama, were your actions successful?" - Without expecting any excuses from Tatsuya, she translated the conversation to the main topic. Without squandering her expectation, he immediately spoke.

	- Of course, I found a goal.

	- So the problem is solved?

	Miyuki did not even realize that she was not against killing a person. Or, to be precise, does not have anything against Tatsuya killing people. If Tatsuya decides to kill someone, this person will surely die. Such a distorted thinking for her was involuntarily in the order of things.

	- No, I did not erase it.

	If the target is visible in the information dimension, the physical distance for Tatsuya does not matter. Live or not living matter, people or things, it does not matter. Clearly realizing that Miyuki was referring to the "problem solved," Tatsuya shook his head.

	"May I ask why?"

	Miyuki did not criticize her decision with Tatsuya's decision. She just wondered why it did not coincide with her expectations. The reason for pardoning Gu Jie was unknown to her.

	"The purpose of my assignment is not to kill the enemy." It is necessary to publicly show that the perpetrator of the terrorist act is punished. - Indirect answer Tatsuya was sufficient for Miyuki.

	- Does it mean that the imperceptible elimination of the goal means the failure of the mission?

	- Right. Although both-ue said that she does not care if he dies or not, naturally, it will be better to catch him alive. Or at least there should be a situation when he, being persecuted, is cornered and killed so that the corpse remains as evidence.

	- This is necessary in order to present him as responsible for the terrorist attacks, and to show people that he is finished.

	Tatsuya nodded at Miyuki's words.

	Miyuki seemed to be pleased to hear Tatsuya's explanation, but suddenly her eyes widened.

	So, why do not you have time for your opponent? It's found. Do not you have to go right now?

	Seeing Miyuki's puzzled look, Tatsuya grinned.

	- Everything is fine. At that moment, I put a mark on it.

	"... The mark?"

	- Yes. For this method, we must thank Zhou Gunjin. It helped me to get to it.

	Pursuing Zhou Gunjin in Kyoto, Tatsuya failed to break through his technique Kimon Tonko on his own. Zhou Gunjin could not leave only because of the blood of Nakura, who remained in his body after their battle, and did not disappear only because of the very strong "will" of Nakura, his "desire" to fight.

	Tatsuya has no ability to blow his blood. During the development of measures against the Parasites, he created a magic technique of squeezing a large mass of psions into a tiny psion bullet, the signal of which can be tracked for several days. During training with Yakumo, Tatsuya found that this magic gives an idea of the location of the target with such efficiency that Kimon Tonko becomes absolutely useless.

	- In Zama I was distracted, and I did not have time to apply it. But now the location of Gu Jie can be determined without allocating additional resources. - Tatsuya said.

	The target is detected.

	Miyuki realized these words, said by her brother, and could no longer doubt them.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Tatsuya as usual came to the training in the temple Kokonoe, without any vanity or complacency. He had already explained to Miyuki that his mission was only to catch the target, and not to kill her. For this it was required to organize search groups. But to communicate with the responsible people was still too early.

	So he decided to kill time after training with Yakumo.

	However, after the end of the usual sparring, something unusual happened.

	"Tatsuya-kun, how's the investigation going?" - Sitting on the floor of the main hall, and sipping tea, brewed by the student, Yakumo spoke in a tone of secular conversation.

	- Bad. "... it was until yesterday" - Tatsuya answered, skipping this reservation.

	"To the extent that there is no sign of impatience." - Yakumo joked, not showing obvious interest.

	- In the end, this is the task of other people.

	This time the words "... until the day before yesterday" were omitted. After the attack on Miyuki, the capture and destruction of Gu Jie became Tatsuya's personal affair.

	- Another's work ... It seems that they work diligently, though ...

	"It's their job." Now I cannot interfere.

	Ignoring the grinning Yakumo, Tatsuya asked the opposite question.

	"How unusual." The Master takes care of my mission?

	- Nothing unusual. You really helped us a lot during the "vampire incident" and "incident with parasites"?

	- In other words, does this mean that there are circumstances that the master cannot ignore?

	"Even hermits cannot completely avoid the problems of this world." Annoying problems.

	From the word "annoying", said Yakumo, Tatsuya was unable to recognize signs of irritation.

	"Could you help us find Gu Jie, the user of ancient magic from the former Dahan, who is responsible for the recent terrorist attack?"

	Tatsuya saw vague signs of an invitation, seized this thread and asked for cooperation. He suggested that he would receive a refusal in reply, so he spoke in a voice in which sarcasm was felt.

	- Good.

	Having lost the gift of speech, Tatsuya nodded instantly.

	- What happened? Are you surprised by something?

	Honestly, Tatsuya thought he would lose here if he backs up. He decided to humbly raise the white flag. Although he understood that he had already been defeated.

	- It's amazing. I did not expect that we would come to an agreement, only a few phrases.

	- It's only cooperation. Just a little help.

	Tatsuya has not yet learned to understand what Yakumo is thinking with his usual lazy grin.

	"Then I'll think about what I would like to ask."

	- Good. Let's use the available forces within the limits of opportunity. And by the way, there are no more techniques that I could teach you.

	- I know it.

	At the moment, Tatsuya did not know that there was someone else who allowed Yakumo to intervene, and what other words were said in that conversation.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Back home from training, Tatsuya dressed as usual in school uniforms and they went to school.

	He did not forget that the school is closed from today. He was going to pick up personal belongings with Miyuki and Minami, which Miyuki mentioned yesterday, after returning from the police station.

	At that time schoolchildren no longer carried textbooks and notebooks with them, like 100 years ago.

	However, for lessons in physical education and club activities, a change of clothes was required.

	If you do not go into details, the school had a cheap laundry, which the pupils actively used, but none of the girls ever took clothes there, but only a uniform.

	In addition, girls usually carried a lot of different things to school. Unlike guys who usually come to school empty-handed, the number of things brought by girls ranged from small to huge.

	Although the gates were closed due to the closure of the school, the entrance procedure went smoothly. They were in uniform, as the rules said, and they carried an identification card of the student, so it's natural that there were no problems. They were not attacked on their way to school, and they did not meet any "demonstrations of protest." If everything goes at such a rate, they will very soon be able to return home. Tatsuya, Miyuki and Minami thought so.

	The forecast itself was not wrong. However, the school had unexpected people.

	- Shiba-san!

	- Ichijou-san?

	Masaki was alone in an empty Class 2A office.

	- Did you come to study?

	Miyuki asked in surprise, because she saw a lonely student at the school terminal, sitting in the classroom during an unplanned vacation.

	- Hmm, yeah.

	Masaki realized that this looks strange, and Miyuki responded with a bitter smile.

	- In Third High today is not a day off ...

	- Aha ...

	Originally showing astonishment, Tatsuya now looked more convinced than Miyuki. Masaki after all used the terminals of First High to receive training from Third High remotely. He had a "place" in the class, but he was not a "pupil" of this class. The fact that this school was not closed at such a time was its standard.

	Miyuki was surprised in response to Masaki's nod, which he again smiled bitterly.

	- From tomorrow, Third High also closes, so I'm free from tomorrow morning.

	Is it okay to miss today? Such words spun on Tatsuya's tongue, but in the end he did not say anything.

	At that moment, the sound of attention was heard on the terminal used by Masaki. With a face expressing "traits," Masaki looked at the terminal. Miyuki, in a quiet step, not to interfere, went to the locker to pick up her things. After this, turning around at the exit, she apologized and left the class with Tatsuya.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	On the way home they did not encounter any problems. Tatsuya decided to think that the activists could not muster the strength for a new "demonstration" in the same place in just 2 days.

	He was not dissatisfied or complained, but there was free time on the original search goal. Based on information that Masaki will be free only after dinner, Tatsuya agreed on the pursuit of Gu Jie.

	"Tatsuya-kun, did you attack the trail of the terrorist leader?"

	- Yes. A little earlier I received a message from family sources.

	- Here's how ...

	Mayumi stared judiciously from the screen of the videophone telling Tatsuya's lies. The incident took place in the territory of the Saegusa family, and it was probably interesting to her what the Yotsuba family was doing there. Tatsuya did not mention that in fact Yotsuba did not have much progress.

	- Gu Jie, responsible for the attack in Hakone, is currently hiding in the city of Hiratsukaa.

	"Uh, Hiratsukaa !?"

	"It looks like the enemy did not move much from the very beginning." His movements were only in a small range. We decided that the enemy's plan would take advantage of the idea that the persecutors will decide that the perpetrator of serious crimes should run away.

	- Here's how ...

	Disappointment Mayumi was directed at herself, her father and elder brother. The search team, under the command of her older brother Tomokazu, was currently working in the interval from the Koto area to Narita. The direction towards Hakone, Izdu, and the Miura peninsula was abandoned, due to the low likelihood of the target being there.

	But the criminal was in this area. This meant that the organized network of investigation was inadequate. Compared to Yotsuba's results, the Ten Master Clans in the person of the Saegusa family, who was appointed responsible for the investigation, looked mediocre. Mayumi found it hard to believe this.

	- Saegusa-sempai, can we continue the conversation?

	- Sorry about?

	Mayumi looked helpless. Though her thoughts could not be read, she was given a miserable look. Nevertheless, Tatsuya did not console her, but only returned her consciousness to the current problem.

	- In order not to give him time to prepare for an escape, you must move on to capture immediately. The problem of the terrorist attack in Hakone is not something that should be decided only by us. You should also consider connecting the police.

	- Correctly. Explosions were held near the capital. The arrest of a criminal puts the prestige of the police at stake. If we do everything ourselves, it can leave a negative trace in relations with the police ...

	Even if they catch Gu Jie, if relations with the police deteriorate along with it, the overall balance will be in the red. The Saegusa family had many active connections in the non-magical world, Mayumi immediately realized what Tatsuya means.

	"Therefore, Saegusa-senpai." Could you mobilize the police to arrest Gu Jie?

	On the screen, Mayumi frowned.

	"Under what pretext?" Just saying that the information was provided by Yotsuba, I cannot get an arrest warrant.

	At the words of Mayumi Tatsuya nodded without showing emotion.

	- I know. If it was possible to connect the police in the usual way, I would not bother to senpai on this issue. Without sufficient evidence, I wondered if I could use the power of the Saegusa family to involve the police in the Kanto area.

	It sounded like an open provocation, but Mayumi did not hide her sullen look.

	"I'll try, but ... I do not think that my influence is better than that of Tatsuya-kun's girl."

	Tatsuya was not going to scold her for playing such a word game. She decided to tease Tatsuya, calling Eric his girlfriend. Nevertheless, such actions did not make sense against Tatsuya.

	"Then, if the sempai wants to cooperate with the Chiba family, let's talk with Erica."

	In this case, the reputation of the Saegusa family may suffer.

	"Please stop!"

	Mayumi could not decide on involving the Chiba family on her own. No wonder she raised her voice and stopped him.

	- As I said earlier, I would like to nominate squads as quickly as possible.

	- I got it! I'll arrange it by evening! So do not scare me so much!

	- Thank you very much, I rely on you.

	Tatsuya did not object to the word "scare" Mayumi.



	After finishing a video session with Mayumi, and also contacting Katsuto and Masaki, Tatsuya already decided that he could rest before the time of departure, when he heard the ring signal informing about the guests.

	The guests were Fumiya and Ayako.

	"Welcome, Ayako-san, Fumiya-kun." But do not you have to go to school today?

	They talked in the living room, Miyuki was dressed in a modest outfit, which could also be used to go out into the street.

	By the time it was almost 16:00. All schools of magic in Japan worked on the same schedule, from Monday to Friday until 15:20, except for club activities. Therefore, they would not have had time to get to the Fourth School here in such a short time. These two (both Fumiya and Ayako) were dressed in little attention. Baggage was not with him, it seems he was left at the hotel. Naturally, Miyuki asked "What about the school?", Not knowing the circumstances.

	"Thank you for your concern, Miyuki-onesama." Today, the Fourth School is closed.

	"Is that how it is?" I heard that Third High is working today.

	To answer Tatsuya's question, Fumiya answered.

	- Following the decision of First High, the leadership of the Second and Fourth also decided on such a measure. And from tomorrow, the decision will be supported by five more schools.

	- I think they greatly exaggerate.

	Tatsuya was stunned by the results of yesterday's incident, the main character of which was himself. It was completely wrong to comment on this, as if not being involved. Was it good or bad that there were no witnesses capable of indicating it?

	Miyuki was targeted because she is the President of the Student Council of First High, this information was to reach the school's leadership, because Izumi was sent to tell.

	"I have to somehow reassure Izumi-chan," Miyuki thought. If Izumi found out about this, she would probably dance in a frenzied dance with delight.

	Tatsuya did not remember anything about Izumi and turned to the two people in front of him.

	- So, why do not you finally voice the purpose of your visit?

	The twins sitting in front of us exchanged glances and decided to respond. Not because of oppressive pressure, by itself.

	- We found the corpse of the user of ancient magic, in the place received from you, Tatsuya-onisian. Oumi Kazukiyo, a magician of ancient magic, also known as the "puppeteer", who perfectly mastered the technique of continental magic, which manipulates corpses with the help of the magic of spiritual beings. This technique is different from the one used by our current goal, Gu Jie.

	"Instead of directing the corpse directly, it controls the DS, infused into the body ... This is different from the magic of Gu Jie, about which we have heard. But the principles are similar, maybe it was his teacher? "To Tatsuya's question," Fumiya nodded without hesitation.

	- Oumi was a descendant of a doctor who was naturalized from the continent about one hundred and fifty years ago. Dahan's officers, no, now the Great Asian Alliance should be proud that they could hide secret weapons for so long.

	- This magic was inherited and transferred before the official recognition of the existence of magic.

	Users of modern magic, even the strongest masters of their craft, are only newcomers, compared to users of ancient magic, honed their skills for centuries. It is hard to imagine what else could be expected. In addition, a purely Japanese name could be taken by parents with a view to mingling with local ones. But he himself seems to have gone in the opposite direction.

	- The user of ancient magic with the necessary skills lived unnoticed and did nothing, and suddenly began to actively use this technique.

	- Gu Jie simply used it as an instrument.

	- Maybe.

	- He can sympathize, but it does not justify it.

	Without even thinking about empathy, Tatsuya continued to ask questions.

	- Have other accomplices been found?

	- An analysis of the residual energy in the house of Oumi showed that perhaps Gu Jie raised two more corpses ... Sorry, we could not find out the identity of these corpses.

	"The fact that neither Kuroba nor Tsukuba could do this says that his skills are quite high.

	- Yoshimi-san and Yuka-san are considered just like you, Tatsuya-onisaan.

	After they become corpses, magicians and non-magicians cease to be anything different from each other. But the magician's corpse never resists magical examination. As soon as life has left the body, there are many opportunities for exploring the magic of perception.

	The "No-Head Dragon" organization, under Gu Jie's control, was the technology of processing the magician's brain into a "sorcery booster". There was no reason to believe that Gu Jie could not do it himself.

	Also in Kamakura, Gu Jie used the bodies of magicians, converted into Generators. There was no reason to do so, having another more effective ability. It was much more effective to involve enemies in suicide. In any case, Tatsuya thought so. However, what are these dead bodies that preserve their life?

	It is well known that magic is the power of the soul. There is no reason to deny this. However, there is still no answer to the question "what is the soul"? All current explanations are at the level of hypotheses and assumptions.

	Hypotheses suggest different options, from the theory of information fields, to theories of quantum entanglement. For example, there is a theory that answers the question "what is the soul made of," gives the answer "it is made of fuzz." On the question "where is the soul", there are options for answers: "in the information dimension," "there is a separate spiritual dimension," "the soul is material and is in our world," "there is no definite place and it is always on the move" - all these theories there are many followers.

	If it turns out that the dead can use magic, it will mean that the soul does not require the existence of a life for existence. No, what then would be the difference between "life" and "death"?

	Tatsuya knew by his example that one cannot resurrect those left behind by life. He knew not instinctively, but instinctively. His unique magic "recovery" told him this. She said that between life and death there is a clear boundary. If corpses can use the power of the soul - magic, then it is also possible that they can express intentions, emotions and memories, which according to theory are also products of the soul. That is, according to this theory, the dead must have the same personality as during life. And than it then differs from life ...?

	"Onii-sama?"

	"Tatsuya-san?"

	- Tatsuya-onisan?

	- Oh, I'm sorry. "The voices of Miyuki, Ayako, and Fumiya pushed Tatsuya out of his thoughts in the depths of his mind. Apparently his thoughts lasted too long, he thought.

	"No, I'm sorry, we interrupted your reflections."

	- Nothing. By the way ... - Tatsuya quickly changed the subject, not allowing Miyuki to take the blame on herself. - Going back to the first question, what is the reason why you came? Despite the fact that the message can be intercepted, it is not the only goal to provide results explicitly.

	Saying this, Tatsuya looked at Fumiya and Ayako.

	"You came to guard Miyuki while I was away?"

	The twins withdrew their views, Ayako sighed.

	"A good guess, Tatsuya-san, as expected from you."

	Her words "good guess" meant that she realized that Tatsuya means "I do not understand your position and your feelings," and that does not mean his "approval." As if saying that he would "see" everything, he showed that they do not need to help.

	"We were expelled from this operation so as not to interfere with the family of Juumonji and Saegusa. It's the same with our father and Yuka-san.

	Of course, this operation was not so important as to expose the secret abilities of the families of Tsukuba and Kuroba in the magic of psychic interference that are unknown to the rest of the families of the Ten Master Clans. As a representative of Yotsuba, only Tatsuya can participate.

	- The school was closed until the weekend, and we were allowed to become Miyuki-onesama's guards. Well, even if I say guards, Miyuki-onesama is still stronger than us.

	"In that case, I'm counting on you until Sunday." Tatsuya nodded to Fumiya and Ayako, who sat with a grim look. - No, I can be calm, just because it will be you guys. Did you stay at the hotel until the weekend?

	- Yes, right, could we stay here? A bed will not be required.

	In other words, Fumiya had in mind that they would be on guard around the clock. As a guard, they did the work without jokes.

	"If you two are not against sharing a room, it's better to pick up all the things from the hotel."

	The guest room was now occupied by Minami, but there was still one spare room that used to be their parents' bedroom when they lived here. It had a double bed, so there will be no problems with sleeping. Their father Tatsuro suddenly does not return, because he lives in the house of his second wife. Tatsuya has already received a higher position in the family.

	"... Neesan, what should we do?"

	For Fumiya there was no inconvenience in living in such an atmosphere. For Ayako too. Nevertheless, Fumiya asked his sister, because he was worried that she might be disgusted with "sleeping in the same room." Fumiya's concern seemed superfluous, Ayako frowned slightly. Adolescents of the same age of the opposite sex in the same room, this fact caused indecisiveness.

	Miyuki, noticing this, wanted to try and suggest Ayako to sleep in her room. However, Ayako's answer was ahead of her.

	"We accept your offer." Tatsuya-san, Miyuki-onesama, Minami-chan, take care of us.

	"And you will take care of us." Minami, prepare a room for them.

	- As you wish. - It was already too late to start cleaning the room and preparing the bed. However, Minami accepted Tatsuya's task without lamenting and without expressions of disgust on her face.

	"In that case, we'll go pick up our luggage from the hotel." "Ayako said, and she and Fumiya got up.

	- It's time for me to leave. There is a high probability that today I will not return. Miyuki, in the rest I rely on you.

	- Yes, Onii-sama.

	- Tatsuya-san, good luck on your assignment.

	Tatsuya with Miyuki stood up simultaneously.

	"I hope to settle everything by tomorrow morning." - Supporting the mood of Ayako, Tatsuya replied.





	Chapter 13





	Gu Jie hides in the city of Hiratsukaa. In order not to let himself be noticed, and also not to spread panic among local residents, Katsuto decided to reduce the number of people involved and increase their secrecy.

	However, the enemy noticed their movement. Gu Jie noticed them by the very ability that always helped him escape.

	- Major donor. It was confirmed that the combined forces of police and magicians led by Juumonji Katsuto began to settle in Hiratsuka.

	"Did they involve the police?" It looks like the Japanese side wants to arrest Haigu.

	The second number of Stars, responsible for overseeing Angie Sirius, the head of the first corps of United Staffs of the USNA Army, Major Benjamin Canopus. He was sitting in the mobile base for operations in the form of a trailer, and having received a report from a subordinate, briefly withdrew into himself. It was a regular subordinate, not a member of the Stars. Other stars were not admitted to this operation. Do not let the terrorist be captured by the authorities (eliminating interference), help him escape, and kill him. Since all the details were absolutely illegal, it was stressed that one should not leave any evidence of involvement with the deserters last year.

	In Zama was a joint base, so he could use regular soldiers from there, but unfortunately, within a limited radius. At the moment he was with a group of saboteurs of the East Asian appearance, members of the military intelligence department. They were a local analogue of Stardust. Soldiers who underwent the procedure of artificial body improvement, who received abilities on a par with the Stars, but could not stand the loads, and became a disposable expendable material with a limited life.

	Half of the detachment were not magicians, but their bodies were also strengthened by mechanical and biochemical methods. Although their performance did not reach the cyborgs mechanizing almost the entire body, their ability to destroy was not inferior to the magicians.

	This group of fighters had very low discipline and obedience, but Canopus completely controlled them, using superiority in force as an argument.

	- Following the simulation, it is necessary to stop Haigu's arrest. - Canopus gave a short order to his squad.

	The troops of Canopus tracked Dziaedo Haigu, i.e. Gu Jie technology, which the Japanese side did not possess. Possible escape routes were also observed. So they can say, there was no "loss of advantage when playing on someone else's field."

	Following the instructions of Kanopus, a group of illegal operatives immediately began to take action. Canopus himself went to the destroyer, waiting on the high seas.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Since entering the country, Gu Jie has been hiding in almost the same area. He used an old friend to get shelter, and soldiers for riots were easily made from local residents.

	The more people he uses, the more likely a leak of information. Gu Jie reduced his contacts to a minimum and instantly cut off his way to himself, as soon as the Japanese magicians approached him at least a little. For Gu Jie, the notion of "friends" was exactly that.

	However, even when it was time to escape from Japan, Gu Jie did not sit with his hands down.

	At first he wanted to use the cargo ship, which he had penetrated into the country, to the last. For a real escape he planned to use the smuggled ship of the No-Head Dragon. But sudden difficulties obstructed his plans.

	The No-Head Dragon is the organization of Richard Sun, who was supported by Gu Jie. It was destroyed by a joint operation of the USNA and Japan in the summer of 2095. (At that time, the Great Asian Alliance did not react to the cooperation of the USNA and Japan)

	Later, the remnants of the organization united at the head of the daughter of Richard Sun, a student at the University of California. This daughter was called Sun Meilin. As the new head of the organization, she banned any hostility to Japan. Although she closed her eyes to smuggling, but people engaged in the sale of drugs and slaves, were exterminated mercilessly. Despite the dissatisfaction with the attitude to Japan of some members of the organization, this girl in a short time restored the destroyed organization and achieved stable results, which earned the trust and respect of the majority of subordinates. Therefore, Gu Jie could not find assistants among them.

	"Sir Hague, this is Doe." Can I come in?

	It was one of the mediators he could find in these circumstances last week. It was the driver of an ambulance, in which Gu Jie escaped from the Japanese magicians from Zama. "Haigu" was the pseudonym of Gu Jie for the No-Head Dragon.

	"Come in."

	Gu Jie did not trust this Dow. In Zama everything went in a hurry, but in the end ended well. The name Joe Dow amused him. He believed that "Joe" was an abbreviated form of "John," and "John Doe" was a common name in the USNA pseudonym for unidentified corpses and lost memory.

	"Sir, the ship's preparation is complete."

	- I see.

	However, he had to use this strange person. Because Gu Jie was emotionally depressed.

	A sudden mysterious look this morning. He came to the conclusion that this is the technique of Japanese magicians who seek him. Gu Jie did not know what information the Japanese magician could get by this magic, but he was sure that Ten Master Clans now know his current location. Being impatient in such a situation was in the order of things. He was in the center of enemy territory. At such rates, revenge for what he has done will soon overtake him. Although this was a big risk, Gu Jie decided to flee Japan as quickly as possible.

	"We're leaving soon."

	- I'll accompany you.

	The fees are over. Initially, he had no baggage in the usual sense. Only money and materials for the magic of curses. Taking the materials for the curses himself, having given the bag with the money to the former policeman, he followed Dow.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	18:00. The cloudy winter sky has completely darkened. In contrast, the earth was filled with artificial lights. Most of the workers now worked remotely and the concept of "sleeping areas" left the language. At the same time, due to the development of the transport network, the area of commercial areas has increased. To understand the degree of change, one can see how the concept of a 100-year-old "shop near the station" has become a modern "store from Hiratsukai to Shibuya." In the outskirts of the capital, the night came faster than in the old days.

	But at 6 pm there were still quite a few people on the street. Too early to start a fight in the city.

	- Gu Jie began to move. He is accompanied by 3 people.

	The eldest son of the Saegusa family listened to the report of the subordinate. Saegusa Tomokazu nodded, showing this gesture "I understood."

	Tomokazu was 27 years old and externally he was very similar to his father Koichi (sunglasses, he naturally did not wear). By magical power, he was inferior to Kojiro's younger brother, 3 years younger than him, but he was still at the level of Mayumi. But by experience and skill, he excelled them. Although there was no cunning of his father in him, the reputation of a good manager after him was already fixed. He was a balanced person, there was no evil in him, as in his father Koichi.

	In short, he was "capable, but not interesting." Uninteresting as a friend, but capable of being a reliable partner in the business.

	- Juumonji-dono. Have you already given orders to the police officers whom we connected to the case?

	Mayumi did not participate in today's operation. From the family of Saegusa the responsible person was Tomokazu. He was appointed to lead the operation from the very beginning, and Mayumi was not here because the brother simply could not allow the younger sister to participate in a dangerous mission. And it was not brotherly love for his sister, but his personal opinion that women do not have a place in dangerous matters. Of course, Tomokazu was much wiser than Koichi.

	However, it sometimes seemed that his brutality was off scale.

	"... Is not that dangerous?"

	Katsuto gently rejected Koichi's proposal.

	"I do not think that the enemy will simply obey the police." Even if you start with cautious steps, everything can grow into numerous victims and battles within the city.

	Tomokazu was referring to the fact that an attempt to solve the issue by force would eventually lead to a charge in the direction of the Ten Master Clans that they made unnecessary sacrifices. Apparently he believed that the enemy has the power that can lead to such a situation.

	- You should completely avoid street fighting, Juumonji-dono, do you agree with me?

	- I think we will have more options when pedestrian traffic decreases.

	Katsuto's answer was beyond their calculations. They believed that the goal would move closer to the night.

	- Saegusa-dono. It seems the enemy is heading to the fishing port at the mouth of the Sagami River, and not to the one that we expected.

	"So he plans to leave the sea?"

	- Yes. I heard that the terrorist leader used a small smuggling vessel to enter the country. Perhaps now he will take a small boat for the coastal waters, and later transfer to an ocean ship in another place.

	- Can we split the capture team into two parts? Ichijo-dono and Yotsuba-dono will be responsible for the new port, and we with Juumonji-dono and the police will monitor the car with a purpose.

	Katsuto thought that Tomokazu's plan was unbalanced. Tatsuya was the only representative of Yotsuba. And the people quoted by Masaki were already appointed for blocking the retreat of the enemy by northern routes.

	"I'll get people to help Ichijo-dono and Yotsuba-dono." If you certainly do not mind participating in your half of the operation only on your own, Saegusa-dono.

	For Tomokazu there was no problem. There was a very high probability that they would capture the target before contacting the second group. All except Katsuto, in this group - from the family of Saegusa, so in the end Saegusa will receive more than all the honors for catching the target. The reputation of the Saegusa family will be restored.

	- ... Good. I'm not against.

	"Well, then let's begin."

	Katsuto took out the terminal and called Tatsuya and Masaki.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	 "The Japanese magicians are on our backs."

	Sitting in the back seat of a car driven by a former Japanese policeman, Gu Jie noticed a car following them. It was not long before the destination. That is, the distance was small. Therefore, you could not tear yourself away from the tail, changing the road.

	- Do not worry.

	Gu Jie thought of using a trained suicide bomber to intercept the chase, and looked at the front passenger.

	- Persecutors in the affected area. Attack them.

	It happened immediately as he finished.

	 A bright flame flared behind him. It was not a single shot, it flashed over and over again.

	"These are ... not hand grenades." Not a portable flare gun. Automatic grenade launcher?

	"What insight, sir." However, it seems that all attacks were blocked by shields. I heard that the magician of the Juumonji family personally participates in the pursuit.

	- Frightened? And what will you do now?

	After the words of Gu Jie, from the remnants of the flame appeared a car of pursuers, completely without damage.

	"There is no cause for concern." Dow's face showed no signs of excitement.

	After passing the intersection, they overtook the car, which dropped speed, seeing explosions. Central AI in this place did not work, but the cars used autonomous AI, which reacted to problems in this way. The car of their pursuers clearly violated the rules of the road. According to the hazard prevention program, the previous and subsequent troublesome vehicles should be stopped. The pursuing car ignoring this rule, increased speed and tried to cross the intersection, changing the lane. But suddenly another passenger car flew from the side and blocked their way.

	If it was a truck, they would have noticed it before. But suddenly a car at the crossroads closed the car and they did not notice a low car. Despite the reaction of the driver who pressed the brakes, the car of the pursuers flew into the car leaving the side at high speed.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	A moment before shots of grenades, Katsuto noticed that they were being pursued by a suspicious van. You can tell the whole group lucky that he was with them. Katsuto's magic barrier did not miss a single grenade.

	- Saegusa-dono. Now there is no time to pay attention to caring for civilians. - Katsuto got in touch with Tomokazu, sitting in another car. "I'll deal with that suspicious car." I leave the detention of Gu Jie to you.

	- I got it. Juumonji-dono, I leave it to you.

	At the same time as the communication session was over, Katsuto ordered the driver to stop. The machine was driven by a magician subordinate to the Saegusa family. He did not obey Katsuto and the Juumonji family. But hearing the voice of Katsuto, he immediately pressed the brakes.

	Katsuto opened the door and went out onto the road. The van, from which they were fired, also stopped and turned sideways. A muzzle was sent from the window of the van to Katsuto, but there was no sign of the man who ran it. Katsuto stretched his right hand forward. The grenade, released without a flash and sound, exploded, striking against the antiobject heat-resistant barrier.

	Katsuto looked at the attacking van, arching his right arm. The next moment the van was crushed. The roof pressed inward and crushed the grenade launcher, deforming the barrel. The explosion did not follow, or grenades ended, or the level of safety in the manufacture of grenades was very high. The van turned over, but it still did not catch fire.

	Katsuto, using magic to jump, approached the wagon, and at the ready "Falang", inspected it inside. There was no one inside. Looking at this, he raised his eyebrows, and just at that moment a heavy rumbling sound came from the direction where Tomokazu and the others had gone, pursuing the goal. Katsuto looked around and, jumping over the car on which he was driving, rushed to the cars, crashed at the crossroads.

	The car Tomokazu was completely crumpled in front, but there was no damage in the cabin. Although the achievements of the automotive industry can boast a high level of security, this time this result was most likely achieved by the protective magic of Tomokazu.

	Unfortunately, the other two could not boast of such a level of skills. Especially the police car was badly damaged. However, the hull design contributed to the protection of passengers. It was also luck that the car became an obstacle, was small.

	"Saegusa-dono, are you all right?"

	Glancing into the window of Katsuto, Tomokazu answered with a small smile.

	- Yes, the body is whole. Ran almost none.

	With a bang, the car door opened. Tomokazu did not come out right after the accident, because it took him some time to switch the lock from automatic to manual.

	"Tomokazu-dono, could you see the state of the police?"

	Katsuto received an affirmative nod from Tomokazu and went to check the cars that blocked them.

	The car, which had become a barricade for them, was hit in the side and stood at a crossroads, blocking their way. Having received a blow, this car seems to have turned over several times and turned into a shapeless crowbar. This and two other cars stood at a crossroads in a checkerboard pattern so that the three cars completely blocked the passage.

	Katsuto, lifting the "Phalanx", took turns looking at the cars that helped to escape Gu Jie. Like the previous van, they were empty. No driver, no passengers. The cars were driven by an unmanned AI. Katsuto found this suspicious. Having such organizational strength, the enemy will probably get away from Japan.

	- Juumonji-dono.

	Katsuto interrupted his meditation and turned to Tomokazu. He was right behind him.

	"Tomokazu-dono, how are they?"

	Taking the initiative, Katsuto inquired about the state of the police.

	- Injuries are not fatal. I provided healing magic first aid to them, but I need to call an ambulance. It is impossible for us all to continue the pursuit. Cars also do not seem to go any more.

	Tomokazu looked around the scene and did not find a single whole car.

	"Juumonji-dono, please follow the terrorists." Meet with the second group waiting for the target at the end of the route.

	Katsuto thought that for the Saegusa family this could be a blow. The current head of Koichi can even be regarded as a betrayal, he thought, but rejected the thought, having decided that he thinks biased. Saegusa Tomokazu was a person who could properly distribute the national interests and interests of the Japanese magical world.

	"I think there will not be any more unexpected attacks, so I leave it to you, Saegusa-dono, be careful."

	- Juumonji-dono, you also be careful.

	Katsuto pushed aside the unmanned car blocking the path with magic, and drove on in the vehicle that had arrived, in which he had been traveling from the very beginning.



	 ◊ ◊ ◊



	Tatsuya and Masaki on motorcycles and two sedan car escorts arrived at the port at the mouth of the Sagami River. Each sedan had 5 magicians. These ten were the elite detachment of the Juumonji family, known for their unmatched fighters. Their fighting strength was quite enough.

	Tatsuya and Masaki left the motorcycles and stood at the entrance to the harbor. There were four fishing boats in the port. All of them were exclusively for coastal waters.

	"He probably wanted to change seats on another ship in the open sea."

	- Maybe it is. - On the words of Masaki's doubt, Tatsuya agreed cold-bloodedly. Masaki was surprised at this and a little embarrassed.

	"Shiba, do you know where Gu Jie is right now?" - Deciding to change the subject, he casually asked Tatsuya.

	- It is directed to our side. Tatsuya did not like pointing out the obvious. But also to make fun of a guy (a man of the same sex) did not cause any interest. - As expected.

	The calculations of Katsuto and Tomokazu that the enemy will go here proved to be correct. Masaki seemed to catch fire in anticipation of the battle. Masaki did not know by what means Tatsuya learned the situation of Gu Jie. But he did not show disbelief in his words. By this time, Tatsuya has already shown impressive results so that Masaki trusted him.

	And if Tatsuya is telling the truth, his ambush (more precisely him and Shiba Tatsuya) will be the highlight in capturing the terrorist leader. Thinking about this, Masaki felt agitation.

	"When will he be here?"

	- Soon ... No! Tatsuya raised his voice and saddled his motorcycle. "Gu Jie has changed course to the west!" Ichijo, let's go after him!

	- Got it! - A little behind Tatsuya, Masaki gave full gas. The motorcycle did not get on the rear wheel, because it had a drive on both wheels. Tatsuya and Masaki followed west to the main road running parallel to the coastline.

	On the way there was a single car. Even without words, Tatsuya and Masaki realized that Gu Jie was in it. He tried to speed up and catch up with Tatsuya. But just at that moment, Tatsuya suddenly jumped off the motorcycle. Masaki reflexively yanked the steering wheel and almost lost his balance. Abrupt braking, turning and again acceleration. The automatic balancer did not let the motorcycle fall, as Masaki had suggested. And then suddenly an attack from the sky slashed the Tatsuya motorcycle and cut it in half.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Contrary to Gu Jie's expectations, Dow went west along the main road, without going to the new port.

	"Why did we not go to the port?"

	"The enemy expects this." We will go to sea from another place.

	Apparently, Dow for some reason prepared measures that even Gu Jie himself could not predict. Gu Jie also worried that the enemy might be waiting in the harbor, so he had no objection if he could avoid it.

	- ... The other side reacted faster than I thought. Perhaps they have a magician who knows the magic of perception well. - Having left on the main road, Dow looked at the rearview monitor and clucked his tongue (the car on which they were traveling was of a type that the driver could sit on the left and right of the choice).

	Gu Jie looked around. Behind them went 2 motorcycles and 2 cars.

	- What do we do?

	"My apologies, sir." There is still a little more.

	Gu Jie did not show impatience or discomfort. He seems to have found a man whose work was too good, and that reassured him.

	- They will catch up with us at such a rate.

	- Now try to break away from them.

	"No, it will not be necessary."

	Gu Jie turned to the suicide bomber sitting next to him.

	- Go on. Kill everyone.

	Opening the hatch in the roof, Gu Jie hanged an enchanted katana on the back of the soldier, who, with a staff in his hand, jumped out of the car.



	The first attack occurred on the leading motorcycle, a chopping attack with a staff in a jump cut it in half.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Tatsuya jumped off the bike on the road. Controlling the magic jump, he landed exactly on his feet. He saw how his motorcycle split into 2 halves. And that insane attack by the sword that did it.

	The cars with the magicians of the Juumonji family drove up. Tatsuya stopped their attempt to join the battle cry.

	- Ichijo! Follow Gu Jie! Continue the pursuit!

	The enemy, armed with a devil-katana, directed the intention of killing in the direction of Masaki. But he did not have time to attack, as he was carried away. With a huge speed in the empty place hit the knife, where he had just stood.

	It was not a natural fall. The knife thrown in the arc was accelerated by the magic of movement. It was Tatsuya's attack.

	"Leave him on me." Forward!

	- Counting on you!

	Tatsuya held back the enemy. Masaki and the people of Juumonji chased after Gu Jie.

	Tatsuya moved from deterring the enemy to full combat readiness. Today he had two CAD bracelet type with the mental control "Silver Torus". Automatic pistol in the pocket. Two knives attached to the belt. One of them was already out of the road.

	With movement magic, Tatsuya returned the knife to his left hand. His right hand was left free for pulling out a pistol at any moment.

	On the other side of the street, a man was approaching him, sending a sword, previously hidden in a staff, to him. The light of the lantern was illuminated by a face directed at Tatsuya. It was Tatsuya's familiar face.

	"Inspector Chiba Toshikazu !?"

	His face did not express emotion and was pale. But this face and appearance, of course, belonged to Erica's older brother, Chiba Toshikazu.

	- The elder son of the family of Chiba from the hundred families, why did you take the side of the terrorist !?

	In response, no words followed. Instead, hostile actions have taken place. Toshikazu struck Tatsuya with his sword. The sword was the optimal size, small and fast. Tatsuya was almost able to dodge a blow using taijutsu.

	In planning to negotiate, Tatsuya made a big leap backward. But Toshikazu followed him without delay. Before that, Tatsuya did not meet opponents, moving and attacking at such a speed. But this does not mean that he "did not see" such people before. It's not that you cannot deal with it.

	Tatsuya aimed at Toshikazu and released a stream of psions. Gram demolition shut off the magic of self-acceleration. The speed of Toshikazu slowed. But only for a moment. The body of Toshikazu was filled with psions and he attacked Tatsuya at the same speed as before receiving a gram-demolition blow. But thanks to that short delay, Tatsuya left the line of attack.

	Tatsuya decided that it was pointless to ask again "why are you helping terrorists?". He read Toshikazu Eidos.

	"Is he dead?"

	Toshikazu leaped rapidly toward Tatsuya.

	Tatsuya aimed a partial decomposition on his leg. At the moment of activation of Tatsuya's magic, Toshikazu landed on his feet and waved his sword down. There was a silent explosion. A flash of unphysical light invisible by ordinary eyes. Toshikazu released a dense psion stream from the whole body. Gram-demolition, canceling the magic sight.

	Tatsuya did not hide his surprise. But this did not apply to the fact that Toshikazu used gram-demolition. Tatsuya did not hear that the eldest son of the Chiba family could use gram-demolition. Not only did Tatsuya not hear. Until now, there was not even a rumor about it.

	However, this means that the Chiba family hid the ability of the eldest son. Tatsuya again activated the "decomposition" by taking in the goal a foot, shoulder and sword blade. Toshikazu released a large number of psions three times, after which his information body greatly diminished.

	"Transformation of information about existence into the psion stream?"

	Tatsuya was surprised that he actually sees what cannot exist in nature. By deleting information about existence in fact, he kills himself. A living being with a will to live will never do it on his own. Moreover, the number of psions in the information body should not be enough to perform gram-demolition.

	Another blow Toshikazu Tatsuya took on a knife around which the shrouded magic of "decomposition". Regardless of the material, any substance will be decomposed by magic at the point of contact with the knife.

	But the sword Toshikazu withstood the magic of Tatsuya.

	"Is the sword magically defined as a single object?"

	This became clear at the time when the magic of Tatsuya activated, that is, at the time of contact between the knife and the sword.

	The secret technique of the Chiba family, Zantetsu. It defines the sword not as a mass of metal, but as a single concept of the "sword," in which a sequence of magic is recorded that moves the blade with the Systematic magic of movement. Since the information concept of a single whole is fixed behind the sword, it cannot be decomposed into components. Magic could not activate due to the refusal of the information definition. However, Tatsuya continued to support the decomposition magic in a limited area.

	1 second. The grinding of steel.

	2 seconds. Katana and the blade of the knife dug into each other.

	3 seconds. Silence.

	Tatsuya's knife cut Toshikazu's katana. The blade in fact is a set of iron molecules. It is impossible to continuously support the magic that turns an object into a "single whole". By itself, the Zantetsu technique is a sword technique that cuts the target in an instant. Action "Zantetsu" Toshikazu ended earlier than the "decomposition" Tatsuya.

	The blade was cut without resistance, and Toshikazu's body moved forward with full force by inertia. But Tatsuya had no chance of a counterattack. Toshikazu went to the side, thus taking away the opportunity to attack him with a knife or fist. Tatsuya turned to Toshikazu. He still held a sword in his hand, but he now had half the original length. Tatsuya did not attack, but again retreated.

	"Looking" he explored information about his opponent. The information presence of Chiba Toshikazu became less and less.

	"So he transforms life energy into magical power?"

	Tatsuya did not hear about this technique. It is known that the existence of "life energy" has not yet been confirmed by modern science (including magic). However, in ancient magic, this term is clearly stated that it "certainly" exists. He often heard this from Yakumo, and also during the incident with parasites, Mikihiko mentioned the term "spiritual power". Monsters that did not eat flesh and blood, but spiritual strength.

	If Gu Jie has the technique of using life force as a force of magic, then various issues that have arisen recently will be resolved. Its dead are not dead, but people with a leaking information body.

	If the person is considered to be alive with the life energy, and the dead - with its absence, then the life energy is drawn out by killing. Putting the released vital energy back into the corpse, it is used as a magical power, while it seems to us that the "corpse is alive", due to the fact that it "consumes life."

	Then the use of Toshikazu gram demolition can also be explained by the transformation of life energy, and not the secret of the family. This also explains the reduction of the information body, as the process in which "information about the form of life" disappears.

	Disgusting magic, playing with life and abusing the dead.

	Tatsuya believed that magic is not good and not evil. This power is only the ability of people, and their actions will determine whether the result is correct or not. There is no good and evil, it is only an evaluation of the actions of people. Such was the image of his thinking.

	Nevertheless, contrary to his own worldview, now he felt evil in the magic of Gu Jie. You cannot so trample on the lives of people and magicians. Although the generators and the "sorcery boosters" were not objectionable, this magic caused only Tatsuya's negation and rejection.

	Tatsuya, indeed, was angry.

	"Chiba Toshikazu!" Tatsuya turned to the dead swordsman. "Are you conscious?" Do you understand what I'm saying !?

	Toshikazu did not answer. He silently tossed the broken sword and took out another, which was behind him.

	"Chiba Toshikazu!" Is this your name. It determines who you are. Tatsuya tried to call Toshikazu, looking at him. This behavior was unlike Tatsuya.

	Toshikazu sent his sword to Tatsuya. The intention of the murder was clear. Normal Tatsuya at this stage would have already counterattacked. Even if the enemy was familiar with the brainwashed, it is perfectly normal to defend him. This is Tatsuya's style. However, Tatsuya was trying to talk to the man who attacked him. Knowing that the enemy is dead, and the opportunity to get an answer tends to zero.

	Toshikazu did not answer Tatsuya. Or could not answer. Instead, he slashed Tatsuya with his sword.

	Instead of parrying with a knife, this time Tatsuya dodged, taking a step to the side. Compared with the previous battle, this time he had a reserve of room for maneuver. Toshikazu technique of the sword seemed awkward to Tatsuya. It seems that this curved sword did not fit Toshikazu.

	The second name of the Chiba family is "magic swordsmen". The elder son of the family should not use improper equipment. Obviously, a third party intervened, that is, Gu Jie. The sword did not look like Continental swords with a wide blade, which he saw from Yanagi, but resembled the ancient swords of the Japanese dynasty of the North. Does this mean that there were additional allies within the country?

	Tatsuya was not familiar with the old swords. He learned to manage swords, but did not teach them the story. But even his knowledge was enough to understand that the form of the sword of Toshikazu is strange. The blade had a strong bend and described the shape of the arc. The handle was made of metal, and at both ends there were through-going rectangular holes. The design also included engraving.

	Tatsuya studied the sword in that instant. Tozikazu tirelessly continued to inflict chopping blows. Although he could boast of the sharpest physical and physical sight, he was not an expert in swords. He did not see the point of studying them.

	He took the sword with a horizontal swing with a knife. Using the momentum of the sword's power, and slipping a knife through the curve of the blade, Tatsuya escaped the blow, taking him aside. Using an "instant call" for the magic of inertia, Tatsuya thought that this sword is a kind of magical device. Most likely this sword is not changed by the existing, but created from scratch by accomplices Gu Jie. Maybe he imposes a negative spell in the cut?

	If you use the eyes more intensively, you can see what magic is hidden there. But unfortunately, he could not afford it.

	Tatsuya applied the "Mist Dispersion" to the sword. The goal was not magic in the sword, but the very substance of the sword. This did not eliminate the risk of explosive release of that magic or other side effects.

	At the time of the activation of Tatsuya's magic, Toshikazu exposed his sword in front of his face. Reactions to magic ... did not happen. More precisely, the time was chosen differently. Could a battle with a magician wake his body?

	The sword shot a stream of high-density psions and blown away the sequence of the magic of "Mist Dispersion."

	System magic uses a sequence of magic to call. Even Tatsuya's magic does not escape this fate.

	Tatsuya, though his magic was neutralized, approached Toshikazu. Not only the left arm was armed, in the right was the second knife with the arm protection. Tatsuya waved his left hand horizontally. The blade of the knife passed through the base of the sword just at the moment when the sword finished releasing the psions. Thus, the blade was cut off from the handle.

	Immediately after blowing the "Mist Dispersion", Toshikazu did not have time to cancel the new decomposition magic on the knife. Installed in his body, the countermagic did not keep up with Tatsuya's speed.

	The blade fell on the road. Just before that, Tatsuya's right fist, clad in the defense of his hand, hit Toshikazu in the chest. From this blow he fell on his back. Tatsuya felt with his hand that he had inflicted heavy damage, an ordinary person, most likely would have already lost consciousness from the pain.

	Body Toshikazu rebuilt in the fall, and making a couple of turns restored his position, standing on one knee. However, if you look closer, you could say that the damage is quite serious, even for a dead body.

	"Chiba Toshikazu!" - Tatsuya again acted in an uncharacteristic way. Again spoke to Toshikazu. "Is this name not familiar to you?" Do you realize who you are?

	Death is a state from which one cannot return to life. Even the "restoration" of Tatsuya cannot resurrect the dead. But where does the boundary between life and death go?

	Brain stop? Heart failure? Termination of metabolism? Or loss of the soul?

	His eyes Tatsuya said that Toshikazu is already dead. However, Toshikazu used magic, which is the power of the soul. "Vzglyad" also said that magic belongs to him, and not transferred from outside. If he is not completely dead, he can be returned by "restoration". But this incomplete state of death can be made complete if it continues to attack. And to use the detailed eyes now there was no time. Gu Jie is still on the run.

	So Tatsuya spoke again.

	If Toshikazu realizes himself, then one should avoid fatal attacks. If Miyuki were here, there would be no need to worry about it. It could have been kept frozen for a while. Of course, Tatsuya did not regret it. The safety of Miyuki was a priority higher than the life of Chiba Toshikazu.

	Choosing rationality by priority, do not worry about such things. Immediately eliminate the enemy. That's the correct answer. Even if Chiba Toshikazu got into this state, he is not the enemy who will cheat.

	- Answer! If at all there is a desire to answer! "Nevertheless, Tatsuya did not want to kill Toshikazu. What is death, and what is life? Inside Tatsuya there was a desire to get an answer to this question. If Toshikazu survives, you can try to find a hint. But even the desire for knowledge does not justify the fact that the life of a magician becomes a price for it.

	Magicians were a tool of war. Tatsuya also thought of himself as an instrument. Tatsuya, himself took many lives, did not claim the right to protect the value of life. Whichever way we die, no matter how we kill, death is death.

	But, at least.

	Resist, and you will die.

	Fight and you will die.





Be afraid, and you will die.

	Surrender, and you will die.

	Obey and you will die.

	Curse the unjust fate, and you will die.

	Sleep, not noticing, and you will die.

	Death must belong to people who go to their deaths.

	Even dying for the sake of others, even killing for others.

	But there should not be such that already killed, thinking nothing, not feeling anything, was killed again, although his "life" is only used.

	Even slaves have the freedom to die. After death, even livestock - only flesh and bones, only material. A thing without life. Using the power of magic, if you can play with this life until death, it turns out that the magician is a tool under the status below the livestock.

	This is unacceptable. For the sake of Miyuki, Tatsuya was secretly preparing a plan to change attitudes toward magicians from the instrument to an acceptable level, like ordinary people. That Miyuki never suffered the fate of becoming a weapon, this was unacceptable.

	"Chiba Toshikazu!"

	In the end, Toshikazu did not respond to Tatsuya's call. He did not have this function. Toshikazu stood up, holding his sword, the blade of which was cut off. Tatsuya noticed that Toshikazu's body increased in size. This was an optical illusion as a result of a rapid approach, which Tatsuya's vision barely caught. After that, Tatsuya lost sight of Toshikazu. However, saying "lost sight of," meant a loss of attention, since the figure itself was in sight. He saw what the enemy was trying to do. Toshikazu flew to Tatsuya from top to bottom in swing with a sword, which lacked much of the blade. He could not have cut it with such a sword.

	However, intuitively sensing the threat, Tatsuya took a knife with a sword hilt. The piece of the blade left in the sword suddenly fell off, the handle covered with drawings moved apart. Toshikazu's left hand grasped the end of the hilt. Both hands of Toshikazu, holding a vertically elongated handle, Tatsuya with a knife slipped under his arm. Then he turned the handle in a chopping motion. A sword without a blade struck Tatsuya in the torso.

	Tatsuya tried to hit the sword hilt with his right hand, covered with the protection of his hands.

	- Ghe!

	Blood splashed out of Tatsuya's stomach. There was an involuntary scream of pain. The jacket, reinforced for bullets and cold weapons, tore and exposed bare skin. In the darkness of night, a black horizontal line flashed right above the skin. Systematic weight magic "Hasikiri", on contact destroying objects directed in different directions by forces of repulsion. Although originally it was the technique of creating a field of repulsive force on the cutting edge or steel wire, Toshikazu without any problems caused it in an empty space, where the cut blade used to be.

	Although the sharp repulsion of the force field stopped at the point of contact, he cut off the skin and reached the muscles.

	[Regrowth: Automatic activation]

	"Self-healing - forced stop"

	Tatsuya canceled self-treatment, which was about to work. Muting the pain from the wound in the subconscious, he activated another magic.

	[Gram Dispersion]

	... decomposed the sequence of magic that creates the black line of "Hasikiri". Without interrupting, Tatsuya summoned the following magic.

	[Gram Dispersion]

	Magic, forcibly extracting psions from the body of Toshikazu, using them for gram demolition. Tatsuya discovered his "look." It was the goal of the second decomposition. Tatsuya eyes found in the center of Toshikazu's chest high concentration of psions, enveloping the heart.

	Despite his injury, Tatsuya drove a left fist into the heart of Toshikazu.

	[Mist Dispersion]

	A hole appeared through Toshikazu's chest. A psion light burst from his body. It left the saved psions.



	The force left his body, he fell to his knees and fell to his side. It seems that the magic that controls Toshikazu used the heart as an intermediary. The corpse on the way to death finally died. It no longer felt the presence of vitality. Toshikazu did not release the hilt of the sword, even when he became a corpse. Tatsuya stood and looked at Toshikazu, dedicating a silent prayer to him.

	- Tatsuya-kun. Suddenly he was called from behind. Tatsuya, not noticing the presence of other people, was preparing to attack. He decided to throw the knife in the direction of the voice. But turning, he saw Yakumo with his hands up, and with a bitter smile.

	"I did not mean to sneak up on you." Maybe you'd better take care of your wound first?

	After these words, Tatsuya remembered the cut stomach. The incision immediately disappeared. In addition, the blood also disappeared, and the torn clothing returned to its original state.

	"What a comfortable ability ..." Yakumo spoke without sarcasm, and, I think, he was seriously jealous.

	"Master, why are you here?" - Ignoring Yakumo's inappropriate words, Tatsuya asked him directly.

	"Our conversation this morning." I'm trying to help resolve the matter.

	The smiling face of Yakumo disgusted him, but he spoke the truth. In addition, there was no excess time now.

	- Thank you. Please take care of this corpse.

	Deciding not to waste time, Tatsuya turned around from Yakumo.

	"Hey, Tatsuya-kun."

	Tatsuya silently ran away. Yakumo shook his head and said: "Well, well."

	- But the truth is, you cannot just leave it.

	Yakumo looked back. Out of the darkness one by one came out people dressed like monks.

	"Take care of him."

	Yakumo's disciples carried the corpse of Toshikazu on a stretcher to a van parked on the side of the road. The van turned around and drove east. After that, on the road again began to drive cars, recently interrupted traffic returned to normal mode.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	At a time when Tatsuya was still thinking about how to strike [the corpse] Toshikazu, the car with Gu Jie was already approaching the destination.

	- Farther to the left! - Dow pointed the way. The driver, "puppet" Inagaki, following the order, turned off, and breaking through the fence, left the forest on a sandy beach. Dow jumped out of the car and quickly opened the back door where Gu Jie sat.

	"Sir, we're changing!"

	Gu Jie understood why Dow is in such a hurry. Far away from the forest, the lights of the pursuing cars could be seen.

	"Stop the enemies here." - Gu Jie gave orders to Inagaki and ran for Dow. A car-amphibian the size of a van was parked nearby.

	Gu Jie heard behind the sound of gunfire. Inagaki opened fire on the pursuers who appeared on the beach.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	"Major, the Japanese persecutors caught up with Haigu. I request permission to intercept.

	Canopus, heading for the destroyer, anchored in the open sea and passing along the southern tip of the Boso peninsula, received a message requesting from his illegally operating squad. For him it was expected. In his view, I would like to avoid as much as possible a large-scale battle with the Japanese side. The battle in Zama was already in the balance from the political point of view. The record of this mission will never appear in official archives. The balance that entrusted him with this task will also deny his involvement in an emergency.

	Even the exposure of Dow's personality, which helps Gu Jie to flee, will already cause a big scandal. Although there is no evidence of the connection of this illegal detachment with the USNA, the military and politicians are not so stupid as not to understand.

	For Canopus everything will be over, if this assistance to Gu Jie's escape will be revealed. Even the title of Stars Major will not save him. The status will be lost. And as responsible for an illegal mission, he will be executed. There is a stronger magician for destructive work, so the army leadership will not mind.

	However, now it was not possible to give Gu Jie to the hands of the Ten Master Clans, representatives of Japanese magicians.

	"Permit me to open fire for defeat."

	- There is.

	The canopy has switched the information terminal from the communication mode to the search mode. Using the Allied identification signal, he looked at the distance to the destroyer. The mission will end with the killing of Jiado Haigu (Gu Jie) on the high seas. Canopus sighed, feeling that even if the mission ended, he would have a bad aftertaste.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Looking at the car turning off into the forest with Gu Jie, Masaki thought: "Gotcha!". The road going through the forest ended in a dead end in the form of a sandy beach. He did not want to use "Rupture" on the main road due to pollution, but on the beach in the winter it would not be such a problem anymore. Also, the vessel cannot be moored on the beach because of shallow water. The ship on an air cushion could, but the intelligence did not report anything like that. So he is waiting for a small boat, on which he will get to the ocean vessel. It takes time to get out of the car and get on the boat. Masaki hoped to detain Gu Jie during the transplant without damaging the boat.

	They drove through the forest and went to the beach. Masaki got off the motorcycle. The motorcycle designed for the road was not riding well on the sand. Masaki ran after the sedans that had overtaken him, using the magic of movement.

	The car Gu Jie stood in the middle of the beach. Sedans decided to go round it from the side.

	There was a roar, gunshots were heard. The tires of the first sedan were shot through. These tires were armored, it seems the shot was reinforced with magic to increase penetrating ability. The sedan slid on the sand and stopped, almost overturned. The second sedan braked in front of him.

	Ten magicians came out of two sedans. None of them hid behind the cars. From the car of the thrown Gu Jie opened a heavy fire. The bullets that penetrated the armored tires were stopped by antiobject barriers.

	"As expected from the magicians, subordinate to the family Juumonji," - in the minds of Masaki slipped admiration. However, he, too, was not inactive. He pulled a red CAD from his shoulder holster and applied "Rupture" to the car of Gu Jie.

	The car caught fire. The enemy was not lucky that this car was on ethanol fuel. The explosion of the fuel container from the evaporation of ethanol gave a spark, and the steam broke out. A young man jumped out of the burning car. It was he who fired, it was understandable by the pistol with the integrated CAD in his right hand.

	Masaki decided to follow Gu Jie, leaving this man to Juumonji people. The detachment of the family Juumonji surrounded this young man - Inagaki.

	Inagaki, completely ignoring the environment, shot at Masaki. The magician, who was between Masaki and Inagaki, stopped this bullet. The next moment, Inagaki rushed to this magician who had defended Masaki. He lunged forward with a pistol that had a knife attached. This was accompanied by several shots, each of which was produced with intense psion light.

	The antiobject barrier was broken. The magician of the Juumonji family fell. There was a big hole in his throat, a piece was cut off his neck. Needless to say, death came instantly.

	Technique of kenjutsu with the use of a pistol. Masaki did not know this technique, but immediately realized its danger. He pointed the red CAD at Inagaki and pulled the trigger. A strong psion light came out of Inagaki's body. "Rupture" was abolished by gram demolition.

	Masaki did not become stunned by surprise. He was different from himself, which was before, and coolly began to build a new sequence of magic. After the defeat of Tatsuya in Monolith Code in 2095, he was always preparing for revenge. He passed simulations countless times, and learned to cope with any possible scenarios. Among them was the scenario of counteracting gram-demolition.

	If magic is destroyed by gram demolition, immediately call a new one. If you do not give the enemy time, one of the attacks will sooner or later break through. This tactic was developed by Kichijouji, having analyzed the nature of gram demolition, based on the release of a large number of psions. Masaki trained his body and mind until it became a conditioned reflex. When magic is canceled by gram demolition, Masaki will not stop.

	Masaki again activated "Rupture".

	But the technique of Gu Jie, built in Inagaki, could not collect psions quickly enough. Half of the psions were not enough to stop Masaki's magic, and Inagaki's body exploded with a bloody flash. Drops of blood almost flew to the place where Masaki stood and were absorbed into the sand next to him.

	Masaki turned around.

	"We lost one person, the enemy also lost one, only Gu Jie and one more remained, who are now heading for the truck on the other side of the beach, no, it looks like a truck, but maybe it's an amphibious car? Well, it's actually it does not matter. " - Masaki pointed the red CAD at this car.

	When he was about to pull the trigger, he was seized from behind. He was piled on the sand. The enemy who pushed him was an ally of the Juumonji family. Masaki wanted to ask why he did it. But at that moment a line of shots rang out. Lying face in the sand, Masaki saw bullets falling from the antiobject barrier. The barrier trembled. This roaring sound, much louder than the pistol shot, he also heard during the Yokohama incident.

	Rifles of increased power, used against magicians.

	Bullets of increased power, created to break through barriers, rained down from the nearby forest. According to Masaki's calculations, the enemies forces were at least twice as large as theirs.

	Invited personally by the head of the family Juumonji, known as the Iron Wall, elite fighters, as expected, coped well with high-power rifles designed specifically for killing magicians. However, the enemy probably possessed a weapon of the highest class. Moreover, grenades also came from above, so they could not concentrate the barriers on the forest itself. They defended at the limit of their capabilities.

	"Such a level of equipment ... cannot be, the USNA covers Gu Jie !?"

	Masaki's inference was not inappropriate, although it was short-sighted. Although Gu Jie did not cooperate with the USNA in his terrorism, it is undoubtedly the USNA that now attacked Masaki and his associates.

	The "Truck" with Gu Jie went to the water.

	"So it's amphibian."

	Still lying, Masaki pointed the red CAD at the floating car. However, the enemy, increasing the intensity of the shooting, attacked directly to his side. Masaki switched magic from "Rupture" to the antiobject barrier. His barrier did not cover all directions, like the magic of Juumonji, but only protected him from one side of the rifle fire. In the direction of the magician of the family Juumonji, a grenade flew over the parabola. Instead, Masaki took on powerful rifles. There was no time to try to stop the sailing car. Masaki was forced to defend himself for a while.

	According to the signal received from the subordinates, Katsuto's sedan drove towards the sandy beach. Shots were heard from the destination. Also, sometimes the sound of explosions. Although there are few private houses in the district, the place cannot be called an wasteland. Nearby there was also a busy highway. It is not known who it was, but their military actions can be called too bold.

	Machine guns also intensively fired at Katsuto. However, all high-power bullets were stopped by Katsuto's barrier magic, which was ready for battle at any second. The flying grenades were also all reflected by the magic of Katsuto.

	Katsuto stopped the car in the forest and went out alone. Traced the trajectory of the bullet that had flown into it, he flew.

	Katsuto's massive body flew with the barrier surrounding him. Without worrying about breaking branches and trunks of trees, he flew straight to the point of launching the bullet. The rifleman was very surprised. In a panic, he shot Katsuto again. The bullet ricocheted and touched the cheek arrow, although he believed that it should freeze in the barrier. After a moment, the shooter was thrown back by the impact of the barrier.

	Katsuto was not satisfied with this alone. The departed shooter, crashing into the tree trunk, received another blow. The shooter pressed blood to the trunk of the tree with a barrier.

	Katsuto made sure that the man completely died down (he did not care whether he was dead or unconscious), and began to look for a new goal.

	A man lying near a tree was dressed in a dark cardigan, he had nothing to show his belonging, but the weapons that he had showed he was not from a simple criminal organization. If this enemy is a force of foreign troops, then the present battle is a challenge against the sovereignty of Japan. From a security perspective, this cannot be ignored. Katsuto decided to give priority to the suppression of these militants, rather than the capture of Gu Jie.



	The intensity of the shooting gradually weakened. Realizing this, Masaki finally noticed the battle in the forest. From there, there were echoes of the use of strong magic. He remembered where he had already seen it.

	Summer of 2095. The majestic male figure seen on the last day of the Nine Schools Tournament.

	"Juumonji-dono is fighting!"

	Katsuto fought against the enemies, entrenched in the forest. It was a one-sided battle.

	When Masaki felt this, he ran to the forest, and not to the sea. He thought it would be better to eliminate the threat in a short time than to run after Gu Jie and have the risk of getting a bullet in the back. Focusing the barrier from the front, he walked toward the gunners.

	The density of fire has already become half the original. Bullets of high power pressed against the barrier. Masaki's shield suited his magical power and possessed high strength, but in some ways was inferior to the magicians of the family Juumonji, specializing in barrier magic.

	Before the blow overtook him, he rolled back along the sand in the side. Lying, he captured the target of the enemy soldier and activated "Rupture".

	From the forest, an aura of fear was felt, from people who saw the terrible death of their companion.

	"Rupture" of the Ichijo family not only shows a crushing combat power, but also lowers the morale and fighting spirit of the enemy. Even battlefields that are used to the field cannot stand against the scene when an allied soldier explodes, splashing blood and insides with small scraps around the area. No one will want this death.

	Masaki felt that the enemy's goal was uncertain. He thought, why start a fight if you are concerned about problems of this level. On the other hand, he found the enemy's confusion an excellent opportunity.

	- Counterattack! Masaki stood up and shouted without fear.

	- Oh, oh! - Called the battle cry.

	Magicians, who were forced to defend themselves unilaterally, began to act and immediately ran. Shots rang out. Explosions of grenades illuminated the night beach. The subordinates of Juumonji did not stop. Masaki also advanced, tearing the enemies into bloody clouds.

	Finally, they entered the forest. In the back of the forest, Katsuto undoubtedly crushes every enemy. The remaining enemy soldiers tossed their rifles and fought with knives. It was the right choice for them. At close range, the bullets ricocheted from the barriers back to the enemy.

	Despite recent resistance attempts, Masaki and Katsuto, as well as magicians subordinate to the Juumonji family, quickly destroyed the illegal detachment of the USNA.

	After climbing on board the destroyer, Canopus received a report on the destruction of his squad.

	They have won enough time for the success of the mission. Gu Jie was already halfway to the waiting ship. Even using the magic of flight, the Japanese side should not have time to intercept Gu Jie on the high seas.

	Even if it was said about the destruction, most of the people from the detachment remained alive. They were undesirable witnesses, which can confirm the participation of the USNA. Their weapons are also undesirable evidence.

	Canopus took a small transmitter, closed his eyes and muttered the words of prayer.

	"Let their souls rest." There's no point in praying for forgiveness. "

	Canopus opened his eyes and pressed the button, thereby destroying the illegal squad in the truest sense of the word.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Confirming that the enemy's resistance had completely ceased, Masaki was looking for Katsuto.

	- Juumonji-dono!

	"I'm here, Ichijo-dono." Katsuto appeared from behind a tree. They were pretty close to each other. Katsuto was wearing a jacket over the sweater. There was not a trace of dirt on the jacket at all. Masaki remembered how he lay in the sand and thought about the hell difference in the purity of clothes. Masaki felt a little depressed, taking the difference in the purity of clothes for the symbol of the difference in power.

	"Ichijo-dono?" What? - It looked like the situation seemed calm for Katsuto. To the question of Katsuto, Masaki shook his head, saying "there is nothing."

	- No. By the way, what are we going to do with these people? I do not think that you can just leave them.

	"Indeed ..." After a moment's reflection, Katsuto nodded. "It's not clear if they were assistants to terrorists, but they cannot escape punishment for what they did."



	Katsuto reasoned for the reason that the time spent here could lead to the loss of the trace of Gu Jie.

	"Then, how about leaving these people to Juumonji's subordinates?" I will follow Gu Jie.

	Masaki agreed with this. So he offered to split up.

	"You will say afterwards, but how?" Gu Jie, apparently already on the high seas.

	"I can run on the water."

	- Will it work? ...

	At sea, even Katsuto could not withstand a direct attack, such as was here. And Masaki will not be able to prevent it anyway. However, Masaki has more long-range attackers than Katsuto. As soon as the ship Gu Jie falls into the field of his view, he will stop it, destroying the engine. Even accidental damage to a non-relevant ship will not be a problem, because of the importance of seizing Gu Jie. Those responsible for terrorism should not avoid punishment.

	- I got it. I leave it to you. - Therefore, Katsuto made a decision. He hesitated a little, but he could not say that he was on time.

	Because no one could have guessed that Gu Jie would help to such an extent. And the next moment Katsuto gave Masaki good.

	Suddenly, defeated enemies lying in the woods flared with fire. In the literal sense of the word. Both the corpses and the wounded bodies caught fire. The magic of self-destruction by burning the body. Although "self" destruction is hardly an exact term. Soldiers of the illegal detachment USNA received an external signal to activate the magic of ignition. The soldiers, whether they were magicians or not, were psychologically trained, and were ready for this.

	Katsuto immediately reacted and closed himself and Masaki with a barrier. Subordinates Juumonji also managed to raise barriers. Their actions were not an exaggeration. Not only enemy soldiers burned. The weapons used by the enemies also suffered a fire. Some simply melted from the heat, some exploded.

	A piece of weapon after the explosion hit the magic barrier. The fire from the bodies began to spread to the forest. Not in one or two places.

	- Faster fire! Katsuto said loudly. Instead of pursuing Gu Jie, preventing the spread of fire has become a priority at the moment.

	Tatsuya ran at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour along the main road running along the coast. He did not use the magic of flying. There was a reason for that. In this operation, Tatsuya did not receive support from the Separate Magic Battalion. He did not refuse to cooperate. Before the battle in Zama, he received permission to use classified secrets, and he understood that it was better to ask than to wait for forgiveness.

	But this time Tatsuya did not ask for help from the Independent Magic Battalion. The battalion also did not make any moves towards his support. As a result, Tatsuya did not wear a mobile suit.

	Of course, you can fly without a mobile suit. But without the protection of the costume, he cannot cope with the attacks of opponents. Tatsuya was not able to use both antiobjective barrier magic, and the magic of the thermal barrier. He could intercept attacks with the decomposition magic, but only if he discovers them. However, during the flight, one hundred percent interception is impossible, since you cannot determine from what angle and distance you will be attacked. The weak defense was a defect of Tatsuya, who specialized in his unique magic and could not normally use another. Although his magic of self-healing could return the body to the state before the injury, it could be bypassed by special attacks that cause serious damage.

	Gu Jie is already far from the shore. Moves to the south-south-east at high speed. At such a rate, he will soon be on the high seas. The forces that help Gu Jie escape have a high level of organization. It can only be the American army. It is not known why Gu Jie needs USNA, but their intervention is clearly leading to his escape. Instead of helping them escape, they could just grab or kill him.

	Gu Jie, playing with the lives of magicians, just does not have to live in this world. The best option is to kill him in prison after being arrested by the police. To wash Gu Jie Tatsuya still did not feel like it.



	Tatsuya approached the sandy beach from which Gu Jie went to sea. He knew that the goal was no longer there. To begin with, he thought to unite with Masaki and the rest. At the time of his arrival, the struggle with fire was coming to an end.

	- What's going on here?

	Masaki looked at Tatsuya with a bitter smile instead of answering. Katsuto answered the question.

	- Enemies self-destructed by fire.

	"Did they fire a suicide bomb with explosives?"

	- It seems that the magic of self-ignition of the body was used.

	Hearing the type of magic used, Tatsuya realized that the enemy wanted to get rid of all the evidence. There seems to be a certain reason why USNA does not want them to grab Gu Jie. It cannot be, is Gu Jie's attack really what they planned?

	- Shiba. Katsuto's question was interrupted by Tatsuya's reflections. - Ichijo-dono wants to pursue Gu Jie with the help of water walking magic. What do you think you should do?

	Tatsuya could quickly erase Gu Jie from here. But it was a secret magic that he could not reveal.

	- Can we ask the cooperation of the Coast Guard?

	Tatsuya's opinion seemed strange to Masaki.

	"Even if we call the ship right now, we will lose a lot of time."

	"Not for us." At present, Gu Jie's ship is in front of the line connecting the Oshima peninsula and Boso. If there is a patrol boat in that area, it can be sent to intercept from here.

	"How do you know the position of Gu Jie?" - Masaki wanted to ask, but did not say it out loud. Katsuto apparently thought about the same, but to ask about the magic of others was a bad form.

	- Let's get in touch with Tomokazu-dono. - Katsuto terminal got out, in response to Tatsuya's offer. Coincidentally, it was at this point that a call sound came from the terminal. The display shows the name of the caller - Saegusa Mayumi. Katsuto turned on the speaker and pressed the receive button to be heard by Tatsuya and Masaki.

	"Saegusa?" What's the matter?

	"Time does not wait, so I'll go straight to the point."

	It was assumed that Mayumi did not participate in the current operation. But she seemed to be aware of the situation.

	"We're on the patrol boat, he'll be here soon." Can you see it already?

	Tatsuya, Katsuto and Masaki looked toward the sea. There really was a patrol boat light approaching the beach.

	"Did you find help to chase Gu Jie?"

	- Yes it is. Tatsuya-kun, are you there? - Answering Katsuto, Mayumi suddenly called Tatsuya.

	- Yes I'm here. "Although Tatsuya did not expect to be called, he did not panic and answered quickly.

	"Tatsuya-kun can tell us where Gu Jie is?" Could you come here? "Mayumi's request was what Tatsuya really wanted."

	"I understand you." Tatsuya nodded in response.

	- Saegusa-san, this is Ichijo. Is not it a problem if I go too? - Masaki hastily wedged his words into the conversation.

	"Yes, it's all right." Juumonji-kun, what about you?

	Naturally, Masaki was also a welcome ally on the ship.

	- It's a little troublesome situation. I cannot leave here.

	Katsuto also wanted to join the pursuit, but he could not leave these burnt corpses, broken weapons and the consequences of the fire. There was a need for a responsible person who would explain the situation to the police and firefighters.

	- Understood you. Tatsuya-kun, Ichijo-kun. We cannot take you, so could you come here yourself?

	- Good. - Tatsuya and Masaki answered in chorus at the Katsuto terminal.

	As if competing, who is faster than another, they ran across the water to the patrol boat at great speed.

	Gu Jie, running on a floating car by sea, together with a car climbed aboard a high-speed cargo ship. Now he was resting in the captain's cabin. There was a knock at the door, to which Gu Jie briefly replied "come in."

	"I beg your pardon, sir." - From the opening door appeared, as expected, Dow. Seeing him, Gu Jie thought: "What kind of man is he?". Looks about 30 years old. Height about 170 cm. Black hair, black eyes, tanned skin. Ordinary face without any prominent details. Nothing remarkable and memorable appearance. Although they had seen each other face-to-face over the last week, an illusion arose that he saw this man for the first time. Gu Jie grinned at his thoughts.

	"Sir, would you like something to drink?" - Dow in hand had a bottle of Shaoxing wine. If the content corresponded to the label, it was a rather high category, though not the highest one.

	- Come on.

	He nodded at Gu Jie's answer, Dow put the bottle on the table and took out a glass from the built-in wall cabinet. Pouring in a glass of wine, he put it in front of Gu Jie. He took a glass and handed it to Dow.

	"You did a good job." You should drink first.

	"Oh, thank you, I'm touched." - Dow took a glass and without hesitation, gulped down the contents. Even knowing that he was being used as a poison test, he did not show a bad face, and took a new glass to pour the wine for Gu Jie. He drank the wine Dow poured, with noisy sips.

	"Hmm ... Good wine."

	- Glad to hear.

	Gu Jie looked at the glass on the table and turned to Dow standing next to him.

	- So, what is the situation?

	"We will leave Japanese territorial waters in less than an hour." At present, there is no pursuit.

	- Here's how. - Without giving himself a facial expression, Gu Jie only now felt that you can relax. It is difficult to say that security is already assured. Just because you are on the high seas does not mean that you cannot escape the pursuit. However, he could not deny the feeling of relief from the fact that he finally left the enemy.

	- What will we do next? About this ship, probably already known to the Japanese.

	- Yes, I think so. Therefore, sir, I apologize for the difficulties, but soon you will be asked to again change the vehicle.

	"You're well prepared."

	"It's an honor for me, sir." After changing the ship, we will go to Sydney.

	"We will not go to the ports."

	"Well ... Then do you have some desired destination?"

	"No, I trust your choice."

	- Thank you for your trust. Then, I'll be back soon, I leave it to you as a gift. - Dow came out of the cabin.

	Gu Jie took a bottle of Shaoxing wine left on the table.

	Zaprygnuyuschego from the sea on the boat Tatsuya welcomed Mayumi and Yakumo.

	"Hello, Tatsuya-kun." You are late.

	"... Master, why are you here?" Tatsuya frowning as usual, Yakumo, showed his slight grin.

	"Why, you say?" Have not I spoken recently? I'm trying to help resolve the matter. Have you already forgotten about this?

	- I ask another, why the master can be on this ship?

	Next to those who spoke Yakumo and Tatsuya, Masaki, who had traveled the same way on the sea, spoke to Mayumi.

	"Uh, Saegusa-san." Who is this monk?

	Mayumi answered with an enigmatic smile to Masaki's question.

	- User ninjutsu, Kokonoe Yakumo-sensei. Teacher Tatsuya-kun, who will cooperate with us.

	"Not exactly a teacher." Tatsuya-kun is not a shinobi or a monk. I'm just training his body.

	Instead of Tatsuya's answer, Yakumo intervened in talking Mayumi and Masaki. A sharp look made him feel guilty, and Mayumi hurriedly added her answer.

	"They told me not to do anything today, but I just could not sit around ..."

	"So, what is next?" - Tatsuya gaze asked to continue.

	- I came to the port of Hiratsukai to ask the patrol boat for help, and met Yakumo-sensei ... who said that he knows where to find Tatsuya-kun, so we took him on board. I knew that he was Tatsuya-kun's sensei ... I did the wrong thing?

	On Mayumi's frightened question, Tatsuya could only breathe.

	- Nothing wrong.

	- That's good. - Yakumo's words caused irritation in Tatsuya. However, instead of this useless conversation, Tatsuya's mind was directed the other way.

	- Saegusa-sempai. Can I start searching quickly?

	- Exactly. Tatsuya-kun, can you specify the direction?

	- Good.

	Tatsuya and Mayumi, followed by Masaki with Yakumo, headed for the bridge of the patrol boat.

	Canopus was in the combat command center of the destroyer, and watched the results of the simulations of the final stage of the operation. Everything went to the fact that the most unfavorable scenario becomes a reality.

	"In short, will the Japanese Coast Guard cutter catch up with the ship carrying Haigu?"

	Canopus looked at the graphic information about the trajectories and speeds of the ships, and mentally made the calculation.

	- Maybe so, but maybe not.

	One of the staff members of the headquarters, responsible for the strategy, again explained the details to Canopus.

	- It is expected that the coastguard of Japan will not overtake the ship Haigu for the reason that at the last moment it will go into deep sea. However, it is impossible to accurately check the boat of the Japanese side.

	The right to conduct and seize ships within the limits of their territorial waters without restrictions is prescribed in the legislative and regulatory acts of the country without any restrictions. It extends to the open sea and is called rights for tracking and rights to continue prosecution, which is recognized in international treaties. Needless to say, Canopus knew this.

	- We need to change the plan for the final stage. - Summarized the employee. Canopus took a deep breath.

	- Changing the plan? ...

	In the end, it looks like it will not end so easily. Canopus comforted himself that it was better to avoid the worst situation of flooding the ship with Gu Jie in the territorial waters of Japan.

	"Let me know when we get to Haigu's ship." I'll be in the cabin until then.

	"There is, Major."

	After the answer of the employee, Canopus left the command center.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	- Direction - here. Soon should be visible.

	Soon after Tatsuya's words, in the light of the lights of the patrol boat a ship was seen. The fast boat, organized by Mayumi, using its speed, caught up with the ship with Haigu immediately before going to the open sea.

	"Captain, please!"

	The captain of the patrol boat gave the subordinates the order to send a stop signal. This signal was sent to the cargo ship with Gu Jie in sound and light form. This meant that the right of prosecution was established. On the bridge of the patrol boat sighed with relief.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	The stop order, transmitted in different languages through the loudspeaker, reached the ears of Gu Jie, who was lying in the cabin. There was a hasty knock at the door.

	- Come in! - Gu Gu Jie's voice oozed with impatience.

	"Sir, I'm sorry!" Dow did not hide his fear when he opened the door.

	- We were caught by the Japanese coast guard. How many ships?

	- Only one. - Dow answered reflexively, not understanding what the question was.

	"So, what are we going to do?"

	"As we planned, we'll go to the open sea."

	"But do not they have a faster ship?"

	On a reasonable question, Gu Jie, Dou answered with confidence.

	- Outside the Japanese territorial waters awaits an allied vessel. Now there will be quite a rough maneuvering, so be careful.

	Gu Jie now did not have puppets with him. There was nothing to attack the patrol ship. Not that there would be absolutely nothing. If there are no soldiers, you can make them. Although under current conditions and tools, and in the absence of sufficient time, the quality will not be very good, but fortunately the enemy has only one ship. In this situation, anything will do.

	Gu Jie looked at Joe Dow, standing in front of him. Since the first meeting, he liked his abilities. Gu Jie, it was obvious that he had a hidden power. He was also sure that he was hiding something else.

	- Clear. I count on you, Dow.

	"As you wish, sir." - Dow bowed low, hiding his hands from the line of sight of Gu Jie.

	Gu Jie activated the spell, pre-installed in Dow. Dow's body trembled in a fit. Soon, the tremor stopped and the body of Dow fell forward. A small pistol fell from his hand to the floor.

	"You wanted to kill me?" Even the whole game you made did not deceive me. Do not think that I will just trust strangers so simply.

	Having said the words of mockery to the corpse, Gu Jie gave the corpse Dow an order.

	- Get up, Dow.

	The body of Dow, which was lying dead, suddenly revived and quickly rose.

	"Do you understand what I'm saying?"

	Dow nodded silently. Looking at him, Gu Jie clucked his tongue.

	"Stop talking?"

	Despite the fact that he prepared the magic in advance, apparently preparation was not enough, even with the condition that there was no proper ceremony. The process of transforming the life force into magical fuel was successful without any problems, but physical functions were partially lost. Gu Jie refused further questions and ordered to attack the ship.

	- Dow. Flood the Japanese coast guard boat.

	Silently nodding, Dow left the cabin. Gu Jie also left, following him. But he went to the bridge to seize the ship.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	"Come in." Kanopus replied to the knock at the door. The officer in charge of the strategy entered the cabin. Upon entering, the employee closed the door and stood opposite Canopus.

	"Major, the vital signal from the civilian Joseph Dow has gone."

	Raising his eyebrows, Canopus asked the officer.

	"Has the murder of the goal failed?"

	- Unfortunately, the probability of this is high.

	Canopus stood silently. Seeing that Canopus wants to leave, the employee turned to him.

	"Major." From the ship carrying Gu Jie moved out a floating car on which they landed on this ship.

	"Leave him alone." A Japanese coast guard ship will flood it.

	Canopus took the device in the form of a Japanese sword, which was leaning against the wall at the door, and went to the deck to carry out the last blow with his own hands.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Seeing that the pursued vessel did not react to the warning, the captain gave the go-ahead for a warning shot.

	- Aim - the surface of the water next to a suspicious ship ... Stop, wait! A small boat started from the enemy ship!

	Mayumi was the first to react to the dispatcher's report on shooting.

	"Tatsuya-kun!"

	- No, Gu Jie is not on it.

	Mayumi not only thought that Gu Jie was trying to escape on this boat. But Tatsuya answered immediately because he doubted it.

	Then what is the purpose of this small boat? The answer came soon.

	"A little boat will come right here!"

	- Armament !? What type of boat !? - On the dispatcher's report the captain asked in an unbelieving voice.

	- The type of boat is an amphibious car! Fast! What is this speed !? - The dispatcher was in shock, as the speed was unattainable for such a vehicle.

	"He's accelerated with magic!" - Having exclaimed this, Masaki pointed the red CAD to the floating car. The body of Masaki lit up with emitted side psions. It was a challenge to "Rupture".

	The explosion of fuel did not happen, it seems the engine was hydrogen. Gaseous fuel manages to dissipate completely before ignition. This meant that the magician on board the car did not receive any serious damage. However, the car began to sink. Suddenly a shadow popped out of him and slid along the sea toward the Coast Guard cutter.

	"Continue pursuing that ship." I'll take care of this.

	Mayumi offered the captain. At this point, she was already completing the construction of a sequence of magic.

	- Aim!

	"The target is a suspicious vessel."

	"The guns are ready!"

	- Fire!

	A gunboat from the coastguard shot a whistle over the sea and pierced the side of the ship Gu Jie. Simultaneously, Mayumi caused magic.

	- "The Magic Shooter".

	There was no rule that the Mayumi bullets should necessarily be dry ice. Similarly, bullets can be manipulated from ordinary ice. Thus, Mayumi can show its maximum strength, because the material for bullets on the surface of the sea is abundant.

	Granules, created from sea water, in huge numbers and from all sides fell upon the enemy magician ... that is, a shadow running on the water. Under close fire, the shadow went under the water.

	- Suspicious ship went beyond territorial waters.

	- Never mind. We continue the pursuit.

	Following the order of the captain, the boat went to approch the ship with Gu Jie. Mayumi looked worried about the magician who had sunk into the sea, but did not ask for his rescue. The capture of Gu Jie was her priority.

	When they almost caught up with the ship Gu Jie, a sudden cry of the dispatcher came.

	"Captain!" USNA Destroyer is in our direction!

	- What!? - A cry of surprise from the captain. From the very beginning of the pursuit, they spotted the USNA destroyer on the radar, right at the border of territorial waters. This meant his connection with the current case. The position of the destroyer was on the edge, but he did not take any hostile action, so interceptors were not sent.

	And now, he suddenly began to move. His course clearly showed that he was helping an escaping ship.

	On the bridge began fuss. The radio operator tried to contact the destroyer.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	- The goal reached the open sea.

	- Small forward. - At the command of the captain, the destroyer set in motion. Course to the south-west. Directly at the rate - the ship Gu Jie, followed by a boat of the Japanese Coast Guard.

	The USNA destroyer was approaching the ship carrying Gu Jie at high speed. Canopus, standing on the very nose of the destroyer, exposed his Japanese sword and looked toward this cargo ship.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Gu Jie, hitting the bridge, drew all the crew members below the captain in the puppets. The captain did not become a puppet not because he could resist this magic. He was left as the "eye" of the ship, so that he did not swim in an unknown direction.

	Gu Jie noticed the approach of the destroyer not long before the collision.

	"Stop the ship!"

	"Fall back."

	The crew on the bridge did not have their own will. But they carried out orders with all the skills and knowledge that they had. At the command of the captain, a backing was given, braking the ship. The speed of the ship gradually decreased and approached zero. The destroyer was approaching. Previously thought that escaped the conflict Gu Jie, at this moment thought that he felt the presence of powerful magic.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Canopus activated the weapon device with the "Molecular divider". Gu Jie's position was projected onto his display in glasses. This was made possible by the victim of a civilian employee Joseph Dow.

	The Commander of the First Corps of Stars, the second number after Major Angie Sirius, Major Benjamin Canopus included the maximum power of the "Molecular Divider" and attacked the cargo ship with Gu Jie.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	"Fall back!" - The patrol boat also started braking to avoid a collision with the destroyer.

	The destroyer approached the cargo ship with Gu Jie. At that moment, Tatsuya felt the call of powerful magic. This magic covered a long, thin and flat space, about 700 meters long. Exceptionally large magical area. Type of magic - the method of inversion of intermolecular coupling "Molecular divider".

	"They want to attack this ship with Gu Jie !?"

	After a molecular divider of this power, there will not even be a corpse left. The ship will be sunk. In comparison with this, everything that they have experienced so far - can be considered a trifle. Tatsuya thought that it would be better if he erased the target this morning, since the outcome is the same.

	Tatsuya tried to use the spell dispersion to cancel the molecular divider. As usual, he extended his right hand forward. This hand was grabbed by Yakumo. Tatsuya turned to him. Yakumo quickly shook his head. In Tatsuya, for a moment, there was a swing. At that moment, the molecular divider was activated, and the huge blade was omitted. The ship Gu Jie was easily divided in half. At the same time, the psion tag that Tatsuya placed in Gu Jie disappeared.



	The existence of Gu Jie, as a man, ceased.

	- What now?...

	"Molecular divider ... it seems?" - Mayumi and Masaki stunned in astonishment.

	Tatsuya looked at Yakumo with an acute look. However, when he saw the same serious look in response, he began to think about the reason why he stopped it.

	The captain shouted into the microphone of the communication device. The reply from the captain of the destroyer came in a calm voice. He said that it was a pirate ship, they tracked them for a long time. It was also alleged that this was an unavoidable act, because he tried to escape, ignoring the stop signal.

	"This ship was slowing down and almost stopped!"

	- It was not visible from our ship

	- It was clearly visible!

	- Send complaints through diplomatic channels if you do not agree

	After these words, the destroyer headed east. Gritting his teeth, the crew of the boat could only see him off.

	Tatsuya, Masaki and Mayumi, with sadness and emptiness in their eyes, watched the retreating destroyer, and already an empty water surface, where in the depths of the sea the ship sank with Gu Jie.



	Chapter 14





	Having lost his motorcycle, Tatsuya had to go home by car with Yakumo. Although public transport is available 24 hours a day, he had a lot of "bad" things, like weapons.

	For some time Tatsuya was silent, sitting in the back left seat. Yakumo, sitting next to him, also did not try to speak. In the middle of the road, Tatsuya spoke.

	"Master, are you awake?"

	- Not sleeping. - Yakumo, who used to sit with his eyes closed, opened his eyes and turned to face Tatsuya. Tatsuya continued to look forward, not at Yakumo.

	"Why did you interfere?"

	"When you tried to dispel American magic?"

	- Right. Tatsuya's voice was not rude. His voice was as heavy as an abyss.

	"In turn, I want to ask, why did you try to do such an unthinking thing?" - Yakumo answered Tatsuya's question in the form of a question. Has stopped thoughtless act, means.

	"Even if you kill Gu Jie, this should not happen until he was presented as responsible for terrorism." It would be better if representatives of the judiciary were present at the same time. If the molecular divider were stopped, we would complete the case for a better scenario.

	Tatsuya took a deep breath with regret.

	"However, I could not even take the body of Gu Jie, and the truth about the terrorist case was buried in the sea depths."

	"Is the resolution of this matter so important to you?" - Yakumo's words startled Tatsuya. He did not have time to come up with an answer, Yakumo continued earlier.

	"Suppose you cancelled the molecular divider, launched by the number two Stars, by Benjamin Canopus.

	Tatsuya narrowed his eyes, glancing at Yakumo. Double surprise.

	First, why in such a local incident did the number two of Stars, Benjamin Canopus operate. For the Ten Master Clans, this is undoubtedly a big incident, but this problem does not affect the national interests of the USNA. Or does this mean that against the backdrop of this incident, something absolutely secret happened to the USNA?

	And secondly, how did Yakumo learn about Canopus's participation? Of course, after seeing such a large-scale magic, we can assume that behind it is someone at the level of the second issue of the Stars. But then it was worth saying that it was "possible Canopus". Just looking at this magic, you cannot specify that the magician that called it - Benjamin Canopus. His participation should be known from the very beginning.

	Yakumo should have noticed Tatsuya's surprise, but did not react.

	"Last year, you dealt with the commander-in-chief of the Stars, Angie Sirius." The US military will understand that it was you who cancelled their magic. Now you are no longer a nameless magician with an unknown pedigree. You were introduced as the future husband of the next head of Yotsuba, as a magician of Yotsuba. - Yakumo's eyes narrowed. Gradual awareness of the situation on Tatsuya began to increase pressure.

	"Yotsuba's name is probably much harder than you think." If at that moment you had "decomposed" the molecular divider of Canopus, the USNA army would have recognized you as an enemy. As a threat to the hegemony of the USNA, you would be planning to kill. - With a firm gaze in Tatsuya's eyes, Yakumo told him his reasoning.

	"Besides, Miyuki-kun would also be in danger." Then you thought about it? I do not think so.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Tatsuya returned home at two o'clock in the morning the next day. Everybody should be asleep already. Thinking so, Tatsuya disconnected the security system from his terminal and silently walked into the front door.

	"Onii-sama, welcome home." - Miyuki waited, sitting on her lap.

	- Ah, yes. I'm at home. Tatsuya involuntarily hesitated, not expecting a greeting. Miyuki stood up with a smile and bowed with elegant elegance, from which many would lose their reason.

	"You must be tired?" First of all, how about a bath? Or, maybe you want to eat? Or...

	- Thank you. First let me take a bath. And prepare a light snack.

	Tatsuya did not know if Miyuki wanted to say that trivial joke about "Or do you want me?", But he interrupted her halfway, feeling disturbing signs.

	- As you wish. - Answered Minami, who came up in the middle of the dialogue with Miyuki. There was a pitying expression on her face, apparently because she prevented Miyuki from completing her greeting.

	Not only two people were not sleeping.

	- Tatsuya-onisan, good work.

	"Tatsuya-san, you came back very late."

	From the living room went Fumiya and Ayako, who stayed tonight in the house.

	- Guys, why do not you all sleep so late ...?

	To Tatsuya's question in a surprised voice, Miyuki proudly puffed out her chest. Well, really did not stick out, but Tatsuya felt such an atmosphere of pride.

	"How can I sleep when Onii-sama does his duty for my protection ..."

	- Miyuki-onesama is talking like a young wife ...

	But those who blushed with Ayako's were Fumiya. Miyuki was smiling happily. It was useless to tell the girls "go to sleep." Thinking so, Tatsuya went to the bathroom.



	Putting military clothes and weapons apart from ordinary clothes, washing off dirt and blood, and dressing in a training suit, Tatsuya came to the dining room. Miyuki, Fumiya, and Ayako were sitting in the chairs at the dinner table, Minami was standing next to Miyuki. When Tatsuya sat down, Minami quickly brought sandwiches. Given the later time, Minami brought Tatsuya herbal tea, and looking with her "is this okay?", Received from him a nod: "completely."

	Tatsuya looked at the three, seated and looking at him.

	- Mission is failed. - Having taken a sip of tea and took a sandwich in his hand, Tatsuya told these three people in front of him, more precisely the four, if we count Minami. Everyone except Tatsuya held their breath. While they were silent, Tatsuya ate one sandwich and began the second.

	"Um, Oni-sama." Mission failed, then Gu Jie ...?

	Gu Jie managed to escape, Miyuki wanted to say, but could not finish speaking. Tatsuya finished his sandwich and turned to Miyuki.

	- No. I confirmed the death of Gu Jie.

	Hearing Tatsuya's answer, Miyuki relaxed. Fumiya and Ayako also changed their tense faces to calm ones.

	- Does this mean that the resistance was intense, and you had to kill him? Would not that be a mistake? It was better to arrest and put in jail, although the request was both-samy and was "unimportantly alive or dead" ...

	- No not like this. Tatsuya shook his head and Miyuki looked at him inquiringly. Fumiya and Ayako looked at each other puzzled.

	- Gu Jie was killed by a magician of the USNA. The corpse did not remain. So you cannot show it to the world and say "it was the terrorist leader". Civilians will not now know who it was, and will not know whether he is alive or dead.

	"However, the terrorist leader was a magician from the former Dahan named Gu Jie, and we know that Gu Jie is dead." Well, is not the incident resolved?

	At the words of Ayako, Tatsuya also shook his head.

	- There is no objective evidence that Gu Jie was the leader of the terrorists. We know this, but the rest of the world does not. Even if we can prove that Gu Jie is the main criminal, if there are no body remains, we cannot get rid of the worry that "maybe he is alive."

	Ayako pointed to the expression "that's it", Fumiya stared at Tatsuya with a misunderstanding. Tatsuya looked from the contrasting twins to Miyuki. She initially did not take his eyes off him.

	- The purpose of this mission was to show the world that the terrorist incident was solved by the hands of magicians. I believe that this is a failure, because I left the public in a state of anxiety.

	Silence reigned in the dining room. Tatsuya finished his tea and put the cup on the table. As if invited by a sound, Miyuki opened her mouth.

	"Even if people in the world are concerned, I know that the case was resolved." I also know that the problem is solved by the power of Onii-sama. Besides ... "Miyuki looked at Tatsuya with a determined look. "Onii-sama returned safely home." For me, this is the greatest happiness.

	Miyuki smiled at Tatsuya. With a smile that cannot be expressed with a metaphor like a flower or a jewel, with a smile that can only be called "beautiful," Miyuki reassured Tatsuya:

	"Onii-sama, good work."



	◊ ◊ ◊



	After that, Tatsuya and Miyuki went to their rooms. Minami also, leaving the dishes on the HAR, left the dining room. Because Tatsuya said that everything is behind, and digesting the thoughts about what was said, Fumiya and Ayako went to the room prepared for them, and were now lying on the bed.

	"... Fumiya, are you still awake?" "Fumiya was almost asleep, when Ayako spoke.

	- ...Not sleeping. What, nee-san? Despite the tension, Fumiya's voice was calm.

	"Um ... What, I do not mean something ..."

	"Cannot you sleep?" - Asked Fumiya with a bitter smile. - By the way, we have not slept together for a long time.

	These two have been on good terms with each other since the earliest years. Do not pretend, they really got along well. Even now, exchanging stinging nudges, there was no evil in their minds.

	They slept in the same room for the last time while they were still in primary school. But now they were at that age, it would be a lie to say that they are not ashamed to sleep together. Nevertheless, these two felt exactly the same as in their childhood years, when the floor did not matter.

	- And the truth. When they told me that I would sleep in the same room as Fumiya, I was sincerely dissatisfied, but it seems to me that now I can thank Tatsuya-san for that.

	Fumiya smiled.

	- By the way, about Tatsuya-onisan, it's very rare to see him so disappointed ... But it seems that thanks to Miyuki-san, he's better. I really think so. And it's true, they are not like a brother and sister, but as a bride and groom.

	"And really, I'm not her rival ..." At the sound of Fumiya's words, Ayako muttered, not with her usual voice, but with the voice of a simple girl.

	"Has Fumiya noticed?" Miyuki-onesama's smile. I cannot do the same.

	If these words were out of jealousy, Fumiya probably already had a joke on his sister. But Fumiya considered the sister's words sincere, and did not think that any jokes were appropriate.

	"Having a beautiful face is not enough ... for such a smile." When Miyuki-onesama praised Tatsuya-san, I felt so much eloquence in her words that enough for a million compliments.

	Ayako sighed slightly. So quiet that Fumiya did not hear. But he did not miss this sigh.

	- So I think, Tatsuya-san also felt this energy and he is already better.

	Ayako fell silent. But the silence did not last long, Fumiya spoke.

	"There is no doubt that Miyuki-san is beautiful, but I will never leave Neesan either."

	- ... Though I feel praise, but I somehow do not feel better.

	- It's not a compliment. From an objective point of view, Nanesan is beautiful.

	- ... It seems to me that your opinion is overstated, is it you so calm me?

	- No no. In Fourth High there are also many guys who want to get acquainted with Neesan.

	"... Again about this?" Then I'll tell them how beautiful Yami-chan is.

	Ayako reached his ears, as Fumiya held his breath. Ayako grinned and cheerfully uttered the words.

	- Objectively, Yami-chan is also a beautiful girl? I mean, if people look at Yami-chan in women's clothes, and they will know that she is a girl only from other people's words.

	- No more disguises!

	- I'm not so interested, but there are girls who like stories about intimate relationships between guys, and I've heard stories about them from Yami-chan many times. About those who are suitable for Fumiya.

	"I'm not interested in that, either!"

	Fumiya screamed and turned his back on Ayako, he seemed to have lost the ability to reason with reason, for he had forgotten that he was making noise in the middle of the night.

	- Good night! - Fumiya curled up in bed. Laughing, Ayako also said "Good night."



	◊ ◊ ◊



	The night had come to an end, in which the mission to capture Gu Jie failed, the dawn came.

	February 20, 2097. Tatsuya, Yakumo and his disciples visited the house of the Chiba family to deliver the body of Chiba Toshikazu. Masaki, who destroyed Inagaki's corpse with a "rupture" said that he would also go, but Yakumo stopped him, saying that "we are going to tell the circumstances, and not to apologize." Miyuki, they said only that it was necessary to go to finish some things after the incident. She, as well as Fumiya, Ayako and Minami was told not to leave the house. At the moment, they probably play into something. Or enjoy sweets. One guy - Fumiya, and three girls, have fun.

	As for Tatsuya, he had already contacted the Chiba family this morning. Then he told them a brief account of what had happened. The family of Chiba, meeting the van with the body of Toshikazu, was depressed.

	"Please accept my condolences on this matter." - Yakumo, who got out of the car, expressed his condolences not as a monk, but as a simple person.

	- I apologize for the inconvenience. - Deep bowing, they were welcomed by Chiba Jouichirou, head of the Chiba family and father of Toshikazu. In his 50 years, he looked like a mountain of muscles and age was not felt. But naturally, he was depressed by the loss of his son. His body looked smaller than it actually was.

	The disciples of Yakumo carried out the body of Toshikazu. The face was hidden, but the woman in the black kimono burst into tears when she saw the body. If Tatsuya did not forget, it was Sanae the older sister of Toshikazu.

	Among the acquaintances there were other acquaintances of Tatsuya. The disciples of the Chiba family also had tears in their eyes. The younger brother of Toshikazu, the "genius of the sword of Chiba", Chiba Naotsugu, was absent. Although there were rumors that their relationship was not so good, but apparently they just did not show it in public. It's because of learning outside the home or something like that.

	At the very end of the crowd meeting Tatsuya also noticed Erika. Honestly, she now wanted to see her in the last place, but could not take her eyes off. After all, today he came here to talk about it with her, by and large.

	"Please, come in." - Jouichirou led the disciples of Yakumo, carrying a stretcher with the body of Toshikazu. Yakumo and Tatsuya followed them into the main building.



	The body was brought to the room of Toshikazu. Now it lay on a futon. His room was unexpectedly neat for a man. No, this expression is somewhat inappropriate. A table, a wardrobe, a rack with one katana. There was nothing else in the room for six tatami.

	Yakumo and his disciples did not do anything religious, such as reading the sutras. The memorial service will be held by members of the Chiba family. First of all, the students of Yakumo were not allowed into the main building. They are now waiting in the van.

	Yakumo and Tatsuya met with Jouichirou in the living room. They sat on zabuttonah - cushions for sitting on the floor. Yakumo and Tatsuya did not experience this problem, but for ordinary modern people the orders of this family would be painful.

	"This time I'm really sorry for your troubles." I would like to apologize again and thank you again.

	Jouichirou laid his hands on the floor and bowed to the floor. The same thing was done by Erika sitting next to him. She was the only one who was present at this place on the side of the Chiba family. Tatsuya and Yakumo knew that Jouichirou was a widower. The absence of Naotsugu has already been confirmed. Sanae remained in the room of Toshikazu. Must be, bemoaning. This contrasted with Erika, who never uttered a single teardrop.

	Erika was dressed in the uniform of First High. The contrast with Sanae was in appearance. Although the school uniform was formal attire, the green color of the jacket and the white color of the dress did not fit the atmosphere of mourning. Tatsuya, incidentally, was also in a black suit.

	"Since it happened that we were witnessing the last moment of your son's life under quite special circumstances, I believe that Chiba-sama should hear an explanation." That's why we disturbed you.

	After the words of Yakumo, Jouichirou bowed again, this time slightly.

	- Good or bad, please tell us everything. Honestly, I'm terribly puzzled.

	"It's not as simple as you might have guessed.

	Yakumo said this as a preface, and began to explain what happened to Chiba Toshikazu.

	He was captured by a magician of ancient magic from the former Dahan, who was considered the main criminal in the terrorist incident in Hakone, and was turned into a puppet. Last night, Toshikazu attacked the pursuit team during the pursuit of the suspect. He fought Tatsuya, who was a member of the pursuit team and was killed. He was already dead, fighting with Tatsuya.

	"... At night I performed a rite for the dissolution of the spirits, so I think there is no influence of evil forces.

	When Yakumo finished explaining, Jouichirou closed his eyes. It was noticeable that his fist, lying on his knee, was trembling.

	"... We are indebted to you in return for this." - Jouichirou finally opened his eyes, Tatsuya and the others no longer saw signs of shaking in him.

	 After the conversation ended, Yakumo and his disciples served tea. Jouichirou tried to talk to Tatsuya, but Erika first took Tatsuya to the dojo. Jouichirou did not scold her daughter for disrespectful behavior. Tatsuya himself was convinced that this was because he wanted someone to talk with Erika.

	The dojo was empty. This happened to Toshikazu. Naturally, the practice will be canceled. Erika went to the center of the dojo and sat down on the floor. Tatsuya also sat opposite her.

	- Thank you very much for returning my elder brother. Erika suddenly lowered her head. And before Tatsuya said something, she lifted her face and looked into his eyes.

	"I want you to tell me."

	Formulation as usual. However, a decent voice was different from the usual one.

	- Have you caught the magician who made a stupid brother a doll?

	Anger was drowned in attempts to say words like "stupid brother". It was, rather, that emphasizes her sadness.

	- He is dead. The corpse also cannot be obtained.

	- Here's how ...

	Erika clenched her teeth. Tatsuya would not be surprised if he heard a gnashing of teeth.

	"Then ..." Erika suppressed her pain, squeezing words out of herself. "Tatsuya-kun will be the enemy for revenge.

	- Clear. - Erika Tatsuya's senseless false accusation was accepted with understanding. In the end, it was Tatsuya who brought the last blow to Chiba Toshikazu, so he agreed to some extent. From the nod of Tatsuya, Erika was only more upset.

	"... That Magic Tatsuya-kun would not help?"

	Erika knew about the compensation that Tatsuya is experiencing under the "Restoration". She knew that it was not easy to ask Tatsuya to cope with this burden. I understood that Toshikazu paid the price for his mistakes in his life. But still she asked for it.

	"I cannot return the dead." Tatsuya's voice sounded indifferent. There was absolutely no guilt in him. Tatsuya could not have an emotional urge to feel guilty. That was the reason. Nevertheless, Erika could not stop the anger from Tatsuya's heartless attitude.

	"... Shiba Tatsuya!" Fight with me!

	Erika rose to one knee. The next moment, Tatsuya kicked with a reversal. Erika was thrown to the opposite wall.

	Erika stood, leaning her hand against the wall, took a wooden sword and sent it to the center of the dojo. Tatsuya looked at Erika in a natural pose, hands down. Erika held the sword straight in the eye. As if waiting for this, Tatsuya started to walk. Erika did not have any concern about pace and speed.

	- Yyaaaa! Erika swung the wooden sword upward. Tatsuya did not stop. Erika kicked the blow down. The blow was strong, there was no usual sharpness. Tatsuya grabbed the lowered sword with one hand. Pulling his hand along the axis of his body, Tatsuya was able to cope with the force that Erika put into the sword. Erika let go of her sword. Rolling on the floor and standing on one knee, she saw the tip of a wooden sword opposite her eyes. Tatsuya sent to Erika the sword he had taken from her.

	- I lost. Tears filled Erika's eyes, which recognized defeat. Laying her hands on the floor, she sobbed, lowering her face down.

	Tatsuya stood beside her until she stopped crying. Meanwhile, for some reason, no one interrupted them.

	"... The girl is crying before him, he would have bothered to give a handkerchief.

	Tatsuya with a bitter smile handed Erika a handkerchief.

	"You do not have to return it."

	- Oh, thanks! - Erika wiped her tears from Tatsuya's handkerchief, sniffed, and rubbed her eyes again, but with the sleeve of her jacket.

	- ... What are you doing? If it was a real sword, you would cut off your hand.

	Erika suddenly began to complain. But Tatsuya answered calmly.

	"It's a wooden sword."

	Tatsuya smiled bitterly, looking at the wooden sword, which was thrown to the floor after the end of the battle.

	- * sob * ... And what is this sudden kick !?

	"The battle has already begun."

	- * Sobs, sounds of sobbing * ...

	Erika roared in despair. The usual behavior for a girl in a similar situation.



	Wiping her tears, looking at Tatsuya with tear-stained eyes, she asked.

	"... Tatsuya-kun." Was the stupid brother strong?

	- Yes. Even becoming a puppet, he was strong.

	- Here's how ... To receive praise from Tatsuya-kun, a foolish brother is honored to have such farewell words.

	Erika turned away after saying this. Tatsuya did not apologize for resisting her in a duel. After all, he did not feel guilty for what had happened.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Saying goodbye to Jouichirou and the students, and leaving the house of the Chiba family, Yakumo, with a bitter smile on his face, spoke to Tatsuya, sitting next to him in the van.

	"What's that on your cheek, red like an autumn leaf?"

	"Eric had to let off steam."

	- Clear. The girl's military business is in the blood.

	Sinisterly laughing, Yakumo asked Tatsuya what he would do today.

	"When I get home, I'm going to go with a detailed report to the main house of the family."

	"So troublesome?" Why not call?

	- Yes. In fact, I think that they will scold me.

	"I do not think they'll scold you ..."

	Yakumo received from Todo Aoba, the sponsor of Yotsuba, the task "to look after Shiba Tatsuya, so that he does not overdo it." As part of this assignment, he stopped Tatsuya yesterday, that USNA did not target him and Miyuki. This result was consistent with the intentions of the sponsor, there was no need to feel guilty.

	However, Tatsuya does not know about this. As well as not aware of the existence of a sponsor named Todo Aoba. He does not even know the face. Yakumo could not talk about this and spoke with a slight detachment.

	- In fact, I also think that my aunt is not very worried. But in such matters, formalities are very important.

	"So you need to apologize to yourself?" You have tough times now.

	Tatsuya showed a bitter smile, without saying anything. Hearing from Yakumo about difficult times, he thought that the irony was that he himself created them.

	"Do not you have to report to Kazama-kun?"

	"Today it will be best to go to the main house, and I can go to him tomorrow."

	- I see. Good luck then.

	For the rest of the road there were no specific conversations, and in the end Tatsuya was dropped off in front of his house.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Tatsuya told Yakumo that he would go to the main house, but the real point of his appointment was now the branch of the Kanto Magical Association in Yokohama. He called the main house to schedule a meeting with Maya, but he was told to go to the branch office, since she was there.

	Tatsuya left Minami at home in case of receiving calls and messages, and went to the Tower of the Gulf Hills with Miyuki, Fumiya and Ayako. At first he did not want to take three people with him, but he was forced to surrender to the persistent entreaties of the girls (mostly Miyuki).

	Four arrivals to the Kanto branch of the Magic Association entered the luxurious living room. Apparently after this there will be a regular meeting of the main clan conference, since Koichi, Katsuto and Shippo Takumi were also present at the branch, but it looks like Maya got this room according to the rule of "ladies forward".

	- Ara, you're all here. Welcome. - Maya greeted the four with Tatsuya at the head. She was sitting on the couch, and behind her, as usual stood Hayama.

	Before sitting down, Tatsuya bowed deeply before Maya.

	- Haha-uh. - Tatsuya spoke in a fictitious legend for him, as he understood that they are in a magical association - a public place. "I apologize that this case did not succeed."

	Maya accepted Tatsuya's apology with a smile.

	"I heard about what happened last night." I think there was no choice, so Tatsuya-san should not worry about it.

	- Thank you.

	Tatsuya bowed, thinking that this was the end ... but really, for him the hard times had come.

	"I could not get Gu Jie's body, what a shame ... Is he at least exactly dead?"

	- Yes.

	First, saying that you do not need to worry and forgive that Maya now wants to say this? Tatsuya nodded warily.

	- How did you confirm the death of Gu Jie? Because there may be problems with some people later, I would like to know about this for sure.

	Not that he wanted to keep it a secret.

	"I learned a lesson from what Kimon Tongko Zhou Gunjin could not track, and developed the tracking magic."

	"Then why did not you look for him until yesterday?"

	Perhaps Maya thinks he is out of control. Tatsuya jumped such a thought.

	- Terms of use were limited, and finally, yesterday I was able to apply it for the mission.

	He understood that until yesterday he worked through his sleeves. But this is because there are more important missions. Tatsuya sincerely believed so, so there was no guilt in his voice.

	- Conditions? What kind?

	But he could not answer this question. Saying "I could not use until I hugged Miyuki" even Tatsuya seemed to go beyond common sense.

	- ... It is connected with feelings, so it is difficult to explain.

	Tatsuya realized that he was suspected, so he answered with superficial words.

	- Ara, how unusual. Good good. Since you say so.

	Maya laughed happily. Her eyes were not for Tatsuya, but for Miyuki standing behind her with a reddened face. This face of Miyuki seems to have given Maya what Tatsuya is hiding.

	"I want to ask one more thing."

	- What exactly?

	Until now, Maya clearly liked to play with Tatsuya. But now her smile seemed to be an ice-cold blade.

	- Was Chiba Toshikazu so strong?

	- ... So much, in the sense? He really was a formidable contender.

	- I do not understand. The enemy had nothing but a melee weapon, besides, his device was not suitable for him, and he could not demonstrate real abilities, so why did Tatsuya-san spend so much time on him?

	Tatsuya felt a cold sweat on his back. Of course at that moment he did not feel unnecessary sympathy for Toshikazu and could shoot him earlier. But he did not use the time for nothing, except for unnecessary curiosity. It is difficult to completely deny that he was wasting time with the existing mission - to catch up with Gu Jie.

	- In the body of Chiba Toshikazu was installed magic by Gu Jie, allowing him to temporarily increase the magical power, although he did not have time to show it all. This is my guess, but I think I'm not mistaken.

	Trying to mislead, Tatsuya slightly changed the facts in his words.

	- Temporarily increases magical power? Maya's eyes became sharp. - "Sorcery Booster" No-Head Dragon was developed on the basis of the technique of manipulating the corpses of Gu Jie ... Perhaps a technique of the same kind was used here.

	Tatsuya felt his failure, but now it was too late to pretend to be a fool.

	- I think that everything is different. It does not seem that there was an external device needed.

	- Then, what do you think it was?

	"... Assuming that life energy exists, I believe that this magic extracts it by killing an object and putting it back into the corpse, turns it into a driving force that controls the psions.

	- Life energy ... It's interesting. So, the magic was implanted in the heart of the corpse? Therefore, Tatsuya-san erased the heart of Chiba Toshikazu?

	- ... You are absolutely right, I apologize for the inconvenience.

	"So, in Kamakura, this magic was not seen because Tatsuya-san from the very beginning erased the hearts of the generators?"

	- Maybe so.

	Tatsuya did not pay attention to this, but now when he was told, he thought that maybe it was.

	- "Amplifier of magic" is obtained by processing the brain. Tatsuya-san encountered the technique of increasing the magical power that uses the heart as an environment. While we were looking at the soul, studying the magic, it seems that the key to a deeper understanding of it was hidden in the body ...

	Maya's eyes gleamed with a mysterious light. These were the eyes of a mad scientist. Thinking about forgiving future experiments on people, Tatsuya prayed in his thoughts.

	It is not known whether prayers were heard, or Tatsuya outwardly somehow betrayed his feelings, but soon Maya returned to sanity.

	"Oh, I'm sorry." I did not notice. Tatsuya-san, Miyuki-san, Fumiya-san, Ayako-san, please settle down.

	Maya ordered the four guests to sit down, and without looking back, spoke to Hayama.

	"Hayama-san, please, tea for Tatsuya-san and the others."

	- As you wish. - Hayama, who still stood like a statue, kindly answered and bowed a little.



	During the interrogation of Tatsuya by Maya, the other three guests stood as if stumped and tried not to breathe. When the tension between the two disappeared, Miyuki and the others felt more comfortable over the cup of tea that Hayama gave. But it was still too early to leave.

	- You probably already noticed, but after that we will have an online meeting at the conference of the main clans.

	This in itself was not surprising. I noticed not only Tatsuya, but also the other three. The main clan conference, held online, meant that members of the Ten Master Clans that were not present in the branch established direct lines of communication with the branch from their main houses.

	The main houses of the Ichijo and Futatsugi families are not far from the Kanto branch, but this cannot be said about Tohoku, Shikoku and Kyushu, but there are also branches that can be used for online conferences. The presence of Koichi and Katsuto can be explained by yesterday's operation, but since Shippo Takumi came, this cannot be anything but a meeting within the framework of the Conference of Chief Clans.

	"Only Mitsui-dono is left, as soon as he arrives, we'll start right away."

	- In addition to Gu Jie, will be discussed any other issues?

	To Tatsuya's question, Maya sighed efficiently.

	"The anti-magical movement has gone too far." Until now, we have not touched them, because they did not go so far as to attack the magicians ...

	Maya glanced at Tatsuya.

	- Extremists from an organization subordinate to Blanche, people who must hate magic, attacked magicians using magic ... ignorant people will think that these are internal conflicts between magicians. From such a wide public resonance, the position of us, magicians in society, is getting worse and worse.

	Tatsuya wanted to moan. Undoubtedly, Maya spoke about the remnants of Egalit, which Tatsuya beat the day before yesterday. That man was not a magician, he was only used as a point of summoning magic. But it was impossible to prove it. Even to explain it is almost impossible.

	With the death of Gu Jie, the terrorist incident of Hakone ended.

	But the seed of malice that he scattered undoubtedly blossomed and was to give a new fruit.



	Chapter 15





	- This is all for the terrorist incident in Hakone. As for the cases in which we allowed the troops of the USNA to easily intervene in internal affairs, I believe that serious consideration should be given to military service.

	"... Is this the idea of the Ten Master Clans?"

	- No. This is my reasoning, Lieutenant-Colonel.

	- I got it. I agree with the opinion of a special officer. I'll talk to the brigadier general.

	- There it is. Sorry then.

	Sending his subordinate, a special officer Ooguro Ryuuya, a secret magician of the Strategic Class, Lieutenant-Colonel Kazama Harunobu, commander of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion Brigade 1-0-1 sat with his eyes closed and his fingers crossed in front of his face.

	Tatsuya today instead of school visited the headquarters of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion to report the details of the death of the terrorist leader ... about this failure ... He also considered it necessary to report on his use of classified military magic in the incident when attacking the hospital in Zama. Kazama was grateful for this report, although the seizure of terrorists is not the responsibility of the army.

	This incident was not a military task for Tatsuya. But it cannot be said that a separate, Magic-Equipped Battalion is in no way connected with this incident. To search for and eliminate foreign elements hiding in the country, the people of Kazama secretly participated in police investigations. They also suspected the intervention of the USNA army. Therefore, Tatsuya's battle with USNA soldiers in Zama was observed and controlled by them. Although the regular forces of the USNA were involved only at that time, they guessed that irregular squads were further used.

	If the Independent Battalion had helped in the investigation of Tatsuya, the Hakone terrorist incident could have been resolved earlier. Do not let Gu Jie escape into the sea, and at least there would be a higher probability of getting a corpse.

	Moreover, this would have been done without sacrificing two talented policemen.

	This was not the arrogance of Kazama. All this has already happened, no "if only". In reality, Kazama and his people did not take an active part in resolving the incident, the head of terrorists was buried in the sea abyss by a magician from the USNA, and the policemen Chiba Toshikazu and his assistant were killed. They became victims of vile magic, which degrades the dead.

	Kazama understood that he could not help blaming himself for the tragedy of the inspector of Chiba and Lieutenant Inagaki. After all, it was the people of Kazama who sent these two into a magician-puppeteer (manipulator of corpses).

	But this is also an assumption.

	The fact is that the investigation has already almost found the place of using bad magic. But Kazama was not against a little help. Lieutenant Fujibayashi contacted only Inspector Chiba, because they did not want to actively intervene in the investigation.



	◊ ◊ ◊



	Senior Lieutenant Fujibayashi was in shock. The shock for her was a surprise. From Kazama, she received an assignment to document the oral report of the special officer Ooguro on the terrorist incident in Hakone. The dictation of the special Ooguro officer, simply Tatsuya, was logical and well organized, and it is likely that the report will be ready by simply skipping the recording through the speech recognition program. This was the only difficulty in her work and she has almost finished.

	But she was still unable to type the text. At the moment she had already listened to the entire report, and wished she had done so. If I uploaded the report in the recognition program by pieces, the program would do everything without her participation.

	She did not dare to re-listen to the recording. There was no courage to listen to this again. Even without that, Tatsuya's voice did not come out of her ears.

	"After Inspector Chiba was killed by Gu Jie, he was turned into a puppet, and he fought me"

	"It is assumed that Inspector Chiba was captured and killed in the house of the user of ancient magic, Oumi Kazuki, who was an accomplice of Gu Jie"

	Fujibayashi remembered the name of Oumi Kazuki. Now she will never forget. It was she who sent inspector Chiba Toshikazu to Oumi's house. The idea of General Saeki was, using the investigation of the terrorist attack in Hakone, to direct the police in search of possible accomplices, by testing possible links with the Kunlunfang Magic Development Institute from the former Dahan.

	After receiving instructions from Saeki through Kazama, Fujibayashi distributed lists of suspects through information merchants. Of course, it was a coincidence that Chiba Toshikazu came to one of such informant. Fujibayashi did not lure him. She simply told him that "according to rumors, Oumi Kazuki is connected with the magicians of Dahan." It is Toshikazu's responsibility that he was not careful. She knew that, too.

	The unconcern of Fujibayashi was based on the presence of personal communication between her and Toshikazu.

	In the autumn of 2095, during the Yokohama incident. Fujibayashi, together with Toshikazu, fought against the invaders from the Great Asian Alliance who penetrated into southern Kanto. In the end, they stopped the invasion and captured many of the opponents. Fujibayashi and Toshikazu celebrated this by drinking together. Also before that, there were cases when they accidentally met during night investigations.

	The memory of this now sits in the corner of her consciousness. Forgotten until recently, these memories suddenly became vivid. Fujibayashi and Toshikazu were not lovers. There was no connection like a man with a woman. Speaking objectively, it was only 2-3 meetings on work, such relations could be called only slightly closer than none at all.

	"So it is," - thought Fujibayashi. Toshikazu did not know that she had been promoted to the senior lieutenant. In the end, he was not even interested in relationships, or pretended to be so.

	Thinking in this way, she did not realize that she still did not accept it.

	Fujibayashi was smart, but she had very little experience in love.

	For the sake of the prestige of ancient magic, for her, the daughter of the Fujibayashi family, her parents appointed a groom. He was her childhood friend and had an engagement during high school. She took it seriously and did not pay attention to other guys, because she had a fiance. But the friend of childhood was for her like a family, she did not feel love even next to him. Nevertheless, she knew that with this person she would soon have her own family.

	Although the groom was a gentle man, he entered the Academy of Defense and joined the JSDF. Fujibayashi did not stop him. As prestigious magicians, they had such vital values, in which the help of the nation is the highest good. At that time, everything was on the level of a joke "well, if you do not like it - I'll leave."

	The groom chose training as a technical officer, so he never went to the front. His specialty was the system of magical search. He received his first appointment in Okinawa. He died there.

	2092, the Great Asian Alliance launched a sudden invasion of Okinawa. 3 months after the wedding. Fujibayashi was sorry that she did not dissuade him from being a military man. It is difficult to explain psychologically why she abandoned the researcher's career and joined the army. Did she want to take revenge on the enemy who took the bridegroom from her? Or did she consider herself obligated to continue his work? I wanted to reassure myself, putting it on the place where the groom was. Or did she want to get revenge on the inside of the army itself, who took the bridegroom?

	In any case, Fujibayashi could not forget the deceased groom. Since then, she tried several times to meet with men, but for a long time this did not continue. In the past few years, parents have tried to arrange for her new matchmaking, but she refused, citing employment in military missions.

	Although there were mostly men in the army, no one approached her with the desire to get acquainted, because they believed that she was too good and talented for them.

	But Chiba Toshikazu did not show fear of her prestigious clan, and was not afraid of her abilities, she had not felt such a feeling for a long time. Perhaps this was the first time since the groom's death.

	"... Oh, how come?" - Thought Fujibayashi. She finally understood. Therefore it is not surprising that she is so upset.

	The first death report of Toshikazu was received yesterday. At that moment, she was calm, not realizing that he really died. Similarly, it was when she was first informed of the death of the groom. She felt the death of her fiance at a joint funeral in Okinawa, when she saw his photo in the lists of the deceased. Likewise, listening to Tatsuya's report on the death of Toshikazu, she thought that, finally, she realized his death.

	This is a strong shock. This leads the mind into confusion.

	"I'm always late ," thought Fujibayashi. She was late to stop the groom from becoming a soldier. She was late to stop Chiba Toshikazu going to Oumi Kazuki.

	"I notice my feelings, only during mourning for a partner."

	"I also loved my fiancé."

	"In relation to Chiba Toshikazu, too, there were only warm feelings."

	Fujibayashi took a deep breath. Tears were not there. There was no sorrow, but only regret.

	Fujibayashi went to the terminal and began to make a report.



	(The end of the arch "Conference of the Main Clans")



	School Change Diary of Ichijo Masaki

	February 10, 2097 (Sunday)

	Now I'm writing this diary in Tokyo. I'm not in a hotel, but in a separate house of the Ichijo family. This house in Tokyo was built by my father for an unknown reason to me more than ten years ago, perhaps to match the level of the Ten Master Clans. At that time, I thought with a child's mind that "this is a useless undertaking," and now I realized this for sure. It is used extremely rarely. First of all, in Tokyo, I can afford a one-day trip. In Tokyo, there are rarely tasks longer than one day, so that an overnight stay is required.

	Especially after the incident with the invasion of Sado five years ago, my father really stopped doing business in this direction. Father and mother recently absolutely do not leave the house together. If father goes to Tokyo alone, then the hotel will be much more convenient. I think that security measures with the support of a magical association are enough.

	So I seriously suggested to my father that it would be better to sell a house in Tokyo. To which he replied: "The sale will take a lot of time and effort, because there are the necessary things to be taken out or disposed of." Indeed, the issue will most likely not be resolved quickly.

	However, I also do not know what will happen in the future. In this house in Tokyo I will live for a while. But I do not complain that I will live in Tokyo. This can be unprincipled, given the reason for coming here, but I'm a little excited. Fulfilling the task of the Ichijo family from the Ten Master Clans, I will live one for a while. The task is to capture those responsible for the despicable act of terrorism.

	On the 5th of this month there was an incident with bomb terrorism in a hotel in Hakone, where the Main Clans Conference was held. Victims of this incident were 22 dead and 34 wounded. The goal was clearly the main clans, but only ordinary people were affected. In any case, the offender should not leave. Even if I was not ordered anything, I could not sit idly by. I am grateful that I was given the task of finding the main criminal, and it is a great honor for me to be elected by the decision of the Conference of the Main Clans. I'm not going to delay my duties. The mission was entrusted to me exactly that day, but now I can finally begin. Until now, they have considered such an important thing in bad faith. So here, I'll be honest. I never show fussiness over other people.

	I must attend First High from tomorrow. This was due to the request of the director Maeda to the director of First High. I will go to the same school as her , I will spend time with her. Even if it's only for a month, I cannot restrain my impatience.



	February 11, 2097 (Monday)

	Is not this a dream? I came with her in one class!

	It is necessary to calm down. Calm yourself, I am.

	So. Today was the first day in First High. I was not transferred, it was somewhat difficult circumstances, and for me they made a special exception. My father originally planned to ask Director Maeda to give me the opportunity to be absent from school during the mission period, so this was not considered as absenteeism. Since the hypothetical search area is located from the southern part of Kanto to the Izu region, I cannot go to Third High. It cannot be said whether it takes 1-2 days or 1-2 weeks. In fact, my father went to ask the director. However, I did not like it. Really. Firstly, the Ten Master Clans are not a state institution. Therefore, of course, the work given by the conference decision is not an official matter. In this case, all you can count on is to consider these days a vacation. But the director, did not seem to want to recognize such a thing. Maeda, the director, is not just a tough person. It will seem impudent, but even for us, the pupils of Third High, the director is strict, but we know that she is a gentle and kind person. This is really troublesome when it treats students as recruits in the army. Even for ordinary students who cannot get enough practical experience because of the shortage of teachers, it makes up guides for proper self-preparation. But this time she broke the system. I do not think that this has anything to do with the Ten Master Clans, or her friendship with my father. It seems that the director Maeda understood the importance of the work entrusted to me, but I wonder why the director of First High Momoyama agreed. She makes up guides for proper self-training.

	 As a special exception, I was allowed from First High to access the teaching material of Third High. Instead of teachers who are slowly learning everything, the technology of learning through terminals allows you to stay anywhere and receive training at any speed. But of course, even at my own pace there is a limit. For each subject of training, there are annual points to be reached, otherwise - you are mediocrity. Even in a magical school, magic items and subjects of general humanitarian law are held at individual terminals. Excluding practice, students cannot study without going to school at all. Basically the problem here is that the knowledge that is taught in special subjects of magical relationships includes secret knowledge. Materials that students bring home for their tasks, are also strictly limited in output and cannot be exported to the network. George once tried to bypass this defense, but was immediately caught and we received a serious reprimand, so this protection is higher than the level of schoolchildren. This is all because the director Maeda organized a closed network between the school and the university of magic. Each of the schools exchanges data with the university on a common network that is not accessible from the outside. With the help of this mechanism, you can also see the literature of a magical university from a magical school.

	Director Maeda contacted the director Momoyama and agreed on access to Third High lecture server through the magical university to access it from the terminal of First High. Thus it became possible to receive lessons from Third High from First.

	Practice in schools is different, so my practical training was postponed to the spring break. Vacations are gone, well, there's nothing to be done. A special situation requires special sacrifices.

	By the way, Momoyama-sensei was very kind, and gave me the right to attend the practical lessons of First High. This is not considered a study, but there is a rare opportunity to study the lessons of other schools. Momoyama-sensei, as well as the director of Maeda, I do not know how to thank you.

	So, I was not transferred to First High, eh, well, let's call this temporary admission? Or a school change, oh, how all this is troublesome. What can I laugh at in my own diary?



	In the morning, when I came to introduce myself to the teachers' room, the deputy director personally took me to the director's office. Then he took me to class. As I heard later, in First High, teachers do not have a morning meeting. Although the usual course of Third High teachers also do not have morning meetings, but on a special course every morning is a very active time. Even if these are similar schools of magic, at this level one can see the differences.

	I was taken to class 2A. I was surprised, there she was .

	Shiba Miyuki-san.

	Irresistible, intelligent and talented, recently announced as the next head of the Yotsuba family,

	My Goddess.

	My friends from Third High will laugh if I say so, but I do know her , and I think that this is the Goddess who descended to the earth by mistake. Beauty? Although I said it myself, but is it possible to describe her with such ordinary words? If I had a more poetic talent, I would give my whole life and devote myself to writing the perfect words for her . What a dummy. So those who would know about these my feelings would say.

	But if you say that she is a Goddess, and not just a beauty, then will not you be even more afraid of dating? Something like this. That's for sure. At first I thought so. But I'm also a healthy high school student. I want a relationship, but after I met her , other women are no longer able to satisfy me. In addition, the desire to make a goddess his mistress provokes an unbearable sense of immorality. After all, I can understand the feelings of the angel of the heavenly maiden hiding in the garment.



	Oh, it looks like I'm a little excited at the end. In any case, when I entered the classroom and saw her , I was surprised. The blood rushed to my head, and I knew that my face was about to turn red. Nevertheless, I managed to do something to prevent redness from appearing during the acquaintance with the class and introducing myself. Admitting such an error before her , I should not at all show it. So I had to go to such a dirty game.

	The magic of the Ichijo family, developed in the First Laboratory, interferes directly with the body of a living person to neutralize the enemy.

	The family of Issiki interferes with the nervous system. Nevertheless, there is an example of the Ichikhan family, who were made Extra, because to interfere in the bodies of people is taboo.

	[note. Itikh Ihanikh, through N. Probably so called before "deprivation of number" the surname of Ichihara (according to the description of abilities it is suitable)]

	The family of Iotinokura interferes with body temperature.

	And my family, Ichijo, interferes with body fluids. An unexpected side effect is that the "rupture" destroys the machines, but the magic was originally created to evaporate the body fluids of the enemy. This interference in body fluids is nothing less than the magic of evaporation. There is also a magic that controls the blood flow. This magic prevented unnecessary blood, which could color the face red. The complexion should not have changed.

	However, this did not mean that the tension also left. It was difficult to continue the dialogue in such a way that the language does not stumble. Because of my thoughts about this, now I do not remember what I said. I hope I did not stir up anything funny?

	After that, I did not have anything strange in my class, so I think that everything is in order. Rather, I think that I was met with friendliness. The First and Third Highs are rivals. I expected a tense atmosphere, but now I understand that I was wrong.

	With regret, I can say that it was difficult to talk to her . More precisely, you can say that I never dared to talk.

	Hey, do not give up! Running for the girls from the very coming here - so you can deserve a bad impression of yourself. I do not think that someone would want to get acquainted with such an asshole. For this reason, today I mixed with the male half of class A.

	The most prominent among them is Morisaki Shun. The eldest son of the Shun family, known for their technique is the "quick draw". In the Tournament of the Nine Schools this does not really help, but in real combat there will be undoubted benefit. I heard that last summer he was able to fight off the secret intelligence agents at the information management bureau. It seems that this was the result of the protection of a student of an American college, whose situation was wanted to be hushed up as internal circumstances. When I heard this, I thought "he has great skills." Not get bogged down in the proceedings with state structures, I also think a good achievement.

	Morisaki was in the disciplinary committee from the first year of training, his friends proudly told me about it. Morisaki frowned strongly at these words and showed discontent, I wonder what that meant?

	The system of the disciplinary committee here is the same as in Third High, and in fact, I was also enrolled in the disciplinary committee immediately after admission. Even if it is not far from the president of the student council, it is a great honor for me to be elected as a member of the committee.

	Speaking of this, I heard that in First High representatives of first-year students are invited to the student council. In Third High they are invited to a disciplinary committee. Apparently, the status of the disciplinary committee of First High is not as high as in the Third. In Third High there are a lot of rude people. If the committee is not strong, the school will quickly deteriorate. If so, then perhaps Third High Committee is an exception to the rest.

	I had dinner with Morisaki and others and they told me different things about First High. It seems that the female part in First High has a higher position. Especially in the second year of training, I was even jokingly advised "not to stare at the girls." In this case, the teacher of the second year said something like that.

	Shiba-san, who is the president of the school board, really has a special relationship. Another, nicknamed "the shadow of the head of the disciplinary committee," from the same class A, Chiyoda-san. An obsessive eliminator of problems, Akechi-san from class B. Satomi-san from class D, Chiba-san from class F are also often mentioned names that I heard.

	We praised only girls. Indeed, there were many familiar names from the Nine Schools Tournament. An exception is Chiba-san, it is worthwhile to be more careful with her. In Kyoto, we acted together for two days, but even then I realized that it was dangerous. There is a fear, but I do not know what will happen if I'm not careful.

	However, what is "the shadow of the head of the disciplinary committee"? The head of the committee is called, Yoshida it seems. There is no doubt that Yoshida is talented, he showed himself in the Tournament of the Nine Schools, and then in Kyoto. What does "shadow" Yoshida mean? Can Chiyoda-san - the one I should worry about most of all? She looks too grown up, it's a little puzzling.

	I was surprised when I was told that the guy Shiba was on the second stream, when he was a first-grader. The course two, is this what we call the usual course in Third High? In other words, not having proper training and observing teachers, being a complete newcomer, he went on to replace the Nine Schools in the Tournament and gave us that bitter experience.

	The presence or absence of a supervising teacher from the moment of admission to high school is a big difference. Even after three months, this is of great importance. But if we talk about this guy, he left us all far behind. Even knowledge of magical engineering proved to be better than George's. What training did he take in Yotsuba? It hurts to admit it, but I felt a chill run down my spine.



	Today was the first meeting on the assignment. Even if I say the first meeting, everyone knew each other in person. I mean that the meeting was the first during the mission. The leader of the operation is Juumonji Katsuto-san, the new head of the Juumonji family, and Saegusa Tomokazu-san, the eldest son of the Saegusa family, is appointed sub-leader, according to such a system that they act separately. The investigation will follow two parallel lines. I was assigned to Jiomondji-san.

	That's right, the family Juumonji and the Saegusa family risk thus duplicating each other or missing something. Honestly, I was worried about it. However, it looks like everyone thought about this a lot. Therefore, a way of exchanging information was invented through personal meetings between Juumonji-san and the elder daughter of the Saegusa family, Mayumi-san. It seems that Shiba will also participate in the meetings on behalf of the Yotsuba family. And Shiba asked me if I joined in today.

	It was a strange feeling when this guy cares about me, but I had no reason to refuse. I replied that I would participate. Then how do you think he said? "Get your terminal, I'll forward the card to you!" It seems to me that this is stupid, that I thought that I would be invited to "go together," but that would not be normal at all. To a man who has just arrived in Tokyo, he gives a map indicating where to go. With the map, even alone, everything will be in order. Somehow it looks too good-natured.

	Anyway, this guy still does not like me. It was impossible to think about it, but it became easier for me when I heard that he said: "I will leave after dinner." But this guy is her brother, that is, her cousin and fiance, so you cannot afford such thoughts.



	12 February 2097 (Tuesday)

	Today, the first class 2A practice was magical practice. The theme of the lesson is the definition of the condition for the completion of magic. The goal is to determine the time of the action of magic as a variable, the content is to make ten sets of magic that change the color of the white plastic ball in the order of red, green and blue in thirty seconds. If the setting of the action time per turn is weak, in the end you cannot meet the deadline or finish earlier. Listening to this, I thought: "This is not easy?". Here, I think the behavior is being practiced in a situation where weak magic already acting on the opponent cannot be overwritten until the previous effect is canceled. I understand the importance of defining the termination condition.

	But if we talk about the principle "you need to firmly determine the final conditions" in the basics of using multiple magic, then these are the foundations that are held in Third High in the first year of schooling. Of course, there was no practical training that required detailed control, but, on the contrary, it was too good, and I thought that this was not a real war.

	The practice that I took in Third High just before the move was to use magic on the target behind the wall. Needless to say, this practical exercise is designed to teach a magical attack against enemies hiding behind obstacles. At the same time in First High I could only see the development of ordinary skills.

	How I was wrong.



	In practice, everyone needed to be in pairs. Instead of being paired with the teacher, I wanted to join her . But I'm an outsider. Including me, in class 2A an even number of people. I will have to be with the one who will remain the last without a couple. While I was thinking, everyone broke up into pairs, but no one came to her . It's good? Is it good?

	As I thought, while everyone was afraid to approach with the question "can I unite with you?", I approached and asked.

	She nodded with a smile.

	Up to this point, everything was fine.

	She finished ten sets the first time in just 30 seconds. Did not deviate even once for a tenth of a second. That's why I cannot deny that I saw this object more and more easy. But I was surprised when, after completing the task, she told me that I had an extra 0.7 seconds left. The admissibility criteria for this practice lie within the error of a plus or minus second. 0.7 second can be an acceptable result, but provided that there is no help, such as a countdown. Shiba-san showed exactly 30 seconds without any help.

	From the neighboring trainees I heard the voice "Exactly thirty seconds." Not bad, Honoka. " I felt very impatient when I heard this. I somehow achieved "less than 1 second of error without help" by the end of the first time limit, but it took me half a day to recover from the shock. Such a shock will be difficult to forget. Even now I understand that in Third High we gave out wishful thinking when we considered ourselves better than others.



	Today also something good has happened. So good that the morning depression was defeated. This is what she invited me to dinner. With them I was called Mitsui-san, and she said "I do not mind"! Although the words sound forced, but who cares? She smiled at me and said "yes, I do not mind"! I regret that my eyes do not have the function of recording video.

	When they brought me to the dining room, familiar faces looked at me with questionable eyes. Last year, we acted together in Kyoto. Yoshida, Saijou, and also Chiba-san. We were together for a very short time, but, to my surprise, I remember them well. Especially strong was the impression of Chiba-san.

	Her voice saying "this ..." I heard first. Did it strike them as strange that I was with Shiba-san? But the most burning look from all sitting, suddenly softened. No wonder I almost refused to attend. When she explained that she had invited me, no one dared to protest. And Yoshida, and Saijou, and the looking adult girl in glasses, and even Chiba-san, and that guy, all showed consent.

	I thought this guy belongs to the type that shuns classmates. My place was opposite her . I was very excited and spent a lot of energy to keep a normal face. Apparently this group always dines together. Feeling superfluous, I wanted to speak more actively, so that it would not be uncomfortable from silence. Nevertheless, although I thought that I would not be ashamed to look into her face, I could not afford to speak first.

	When I pondered this, Chiba-san suddenly asked me about the progress of the investigation. I almost sprinkled miso soup. I cannot deny such a rude appearance in front of her . I desperately swallowed what was in my mouth. In any case, to say this in a place where they can eavesdrop, what an unrestrained woman. Do not you know how serious this is? I have not yet seen people with such a weak type of thinking.

	But I also thought that it was a chance. Although neither she nor that guy stopped Chiba-san, even if the task is known, if not to go into details, everything will be all right. This is a good opportunity to start a conversation for me, who just got into the company and does not have a common theme.

	However, that guy. He put his word, interrupting me. Also what for "so outstanding magician"? Whatever you think, such a blatant compliment. But then it became somewhat strange. She tells me Envy, and I cannot think of much. I was praised? Or just politeness? Did you seriously envy? Now, when the time has passed, I'm not sure.

	Talking about this guy, they talked with Mitsui-san briskly, and I could not say anything. Mitsui-san loves it? Although even if it's not love, I do not have to stop it. Nevertheless, thanks to these events, I was able to talk with her a little , without fear of this guy. Unfortunately I did not remember what I was talking about, but I feel that the distance between us was to be reduced. I wonder if I should thank this guy? Or should I be proud of this as my own achievement?

	It seems that neither.



	13 February 2097 (Wednesday)

	I'm in the same class with her , I'm in bliss.

	I was not going to neglect the task, just thinking about whether this is sufficient. At the evening meeting, this guy reported on the progress of the investigation. Last night, it seems he pursued our goal directly one step ahead of all of us. Although the goal is not caught, but this is an impressive result. I did not even think there was a third party involved in the investigation. While we could not find any clues, they reached the shelter of the main criminal. This is no excuse, even though I've only been here three days since I came to Tokyo. I'm not looking for excuses. But I still do not even know where to start.

	Today at school it was fun. I was glad to see her smile. Realizing myself pleased with this situation, I felt myself bathed in cold water. I want to jump out of this house right now and I want to find a goal. But I can only run blindly, it will just make me tired and has no meaning. Thinking that it will be so, makes me stay. For now, let's think about what I can do.

	My father told me that I can use the resources of the Ichijo family. Despite the fact that local monitoring also requires personnel, we have allocated fewer people to this place. We'll go see the scene of the incident tomorrow. The families of Saegusa, Juumonji and Yotsuba will be investigated further, and moreover, the police should also study the place for the presence of hooks. If you carefully study the place of events, you can stumble upon something directing to the goal. I think this is not the case when going to school is more important. But this is the betrayal of the director of Maeda, who sought this exception. Tomorrow you need to be calm, until you finish your studies at school. And as soon as they are over, we immediately begin the investigation.

	Because I was given a mission in Tokyo.



	February 14, 2097 (Thursday)

	I planned to finish lunch alone, leaving my last decision in my mind. It was obvious that I did not dare to talk to her , so after the third lesson I quickly got up to go to the dining room. I was ready to leave the class, as Shiba-san's voice caught me. Such a hindrance could not stop me.

	When I went to the front row of the classroom, I suddenly had two girls who called me "Ichijo-kun" in front of me. As soon as I realized that it was addressed to me, I found that I have in both hands small boxes, tied with ribbons. "Accept it, please!" they said and fled the classroom.

	At that moment, I must have had a stupid face. Then I seriously did not understand what happened. Small boxes in a gift box with a ribbon, could not be anything but a gift, and it seemed to me a misunderstanding. But I did not understand why I received the gift, I was a fool.

	While I stood in a stupor, the number of gifts I had in my hands increased to seven. All were from girls. They talked with each other, saying "she ran away," "now it's my turn," and I stood there and could not understand what was happening.

	Her voice took me out of the stupor. "You are very popular" - a voice said with a smile, one way or another, sounded from behind, seemed cruel to me. I turned around in horror. Today her smile shone even brighter. My heart was filled with impatience. But I still did not understand what was going on. What am I so fascinated by them? I could only say what it is and why.

	Apparently noticing my face, Kitayama-san realized that I did not understand the reason. She told me. Today is Valentine's Day. These words were for me as a verdict to the devil. By the way, today is the 14th of February. My head was filled with thoughts of the task and I forgot about Valentine's Day. After that, I began to understand that in those boxes there is that same Valentine's Day chocolate. And I have both hands full of it, what do I do now? What would she think ? I had a cold sweat on my back.

	"Such a pace will be even more" - her voice was like the music of angels, announcing that the end had come.



	After that, I went to the dining room with Shiba-san and others, having decided that the experience of yesterday would seem to repeat itself. More precisely, I was dragged by Mitsui-san. But this is not consolation. Chocolate, of course, was left in the classroom.

	I'm also a guy. It's sad not to have chocolate on Valentine's Day. Even chocolate of politeness gives a sense of relief. But this year everything is different. It was like a pit with thorns, getting chocolate in front of a beloved girl, though unrequited. I would like to forget this as quickly as possible.

	However, when we came to the dining room, Chiba-san sprinkled salt on the wound.

	"How much chocolate did you get? Well?" Disservice.

	"Speaking of chocolate today, we mean chocolate Valentine, what else?". Ah well, really, thanks for the help.

	"I bet that it's more than ten." So how much? ". At that moment I was barely able to restrain the murderous intention.

	I know. She did not want anything wrong. For the guys, Valentine's chocolate is a kind of reward. If they are told that they should receive a lot, they do not feel bad, it's normal. But my current case is an exception. I sincerely replied: "Quantity does not matter." I prayed that they would move on to another topic. But it seemed that the whole world was at this moment against me. Chiba-san and Mitsui-san told everyone how much chocolate I received.

	Yes I know. This is my paranoia. This is my excessive self-awareness. But I was afraid to see her face at that moment.



	In the evening after the meeting, I ran around searching for terrorists, trying to forget the awkward experience of Valentine's Day. In the end, it was useless. The search party also did not have any achievements.

	Hmm. Tomorrow I seem to suffer from lack of sleep.



	February 15, 2097 (Friday)

	What we feared after the terrorist attack, the magicians, still happened. No, I must say it began. The clash of demonstrators with the police. Stoning and fights. It is easy to predict that soon the targets of violence will change from the police to magicians in general. Even students of magical schools can be attacked, and this is not speculation. I'm worried about friends from Third High.

	To divert consciousness from bad expectations, I will tell you about the number of arrests reported in the news. It was announced the arrest of 24 people, but the real number should be higher. After the invasion of Sado there were hostile demonstrations in Hokuriku, but they were completely hidden from the public, and information about the arrests was not published. This guy said "more than recently." As I thought, the situation is getting worse.

	According to Shiba, the protesters shown on television are about 200 people. This is definitely not small. If so, the total number is twice as high, or even more. Perhaps it was a demonstration for 500 people.

	For lunch in First High, everyone was in a gloomy mood. Yesterday's bright memories seemed deceitful to people. If it was Third High, my classmates and I would also actively discuss this problem. Even if not me, there will be many people who would say: "Let them try to attack us, we have something to answer!". However, it seems that there are not so many such people in First High.



	After I returned from the meeting, I called George. I was worried about the condition of Third High. As expected, there were also all upset after lunch. George laughed, telling that the number of wounded in club activities was more than usual. Bloodthirsty guys. But this was the norm for Third High, which calmed me down.

	They also worried about me. George asked how the mission was progressing. The videophone turned out to be uncomfortable at such a time. I could not keep it a secret.

	However, this is also convenient. It's been some time since I went to Tokyo, but of course I feel a dead end. I do not know what to do. I thought and consulted George about the current situation. George gave an unexpected advice, thinking a little.

	Can it be better to stop competing with the investigation? Indeed, the local families of Saegusa and Juumonji should not be at enmity in the search activities in their Kanto area. It's not because of the desire to admit defeat, but their resources are just too different.

	I was impatient to achieve Shiba, who approached the goal in Zama after just one step in the investigation. And we did not even have any clues. I do not want to make excuses, but then I thought that we lagged behind an unfamiliar situation.

	George told me that my turn will come when the target is found. The intelligence of Saegusa and Juumonji families is looking for a goal, and I need it as a force to pursue and catch the target. George's idea was that we should split up at this stage.

	But if I have nothing to do until the goal is found, then I do not need to live in Tokyo. Although George's advice cannot be accepted completely, it has become a little easier. I'm sure George said: "Do not compete" with this goal. He is a reliable friend.



	February 16, 2097 (Saturday)

	At the evening meeting I learned about the incident at Second High. Valentine's Day shock was overwritten by yesterday's bad news, then I talked with George in the evening and was able to relieve impatience, and today I returned the stock of vivacity to the usual everyday life at school with her . Although talking with her and classmates was awkward.

	After enjoying the school life, I did not run to investigate on my own, but I studied the reports of our detachments, and after that I went to an evening meeting. There I heard the news that the pupils of Second High were attacked by "humanists". I was not going to underestimate the situation. But the situation is getting worse than I expected. I did not expect at all that they would go to direct violence. No, I thought it would happen, but not so soon.

	The pupils of Second High, subjected to the attack of anti-magical extremists, seem seriously injured. I hope this will not cause any consequences. Saegusa-san was also very worried. As a former president of the school board of First High, she was worried whether the pupils of First High would also become targets of "humanists". I also worry about it. Because the anti-magical movement is more likely to target First High than the Third. Located far from the city center, the Tokyo First High is very attractive to attack.

	Even a strong magician, physically this is an ordinary person. The worst result cannot be ruled out if a sudden attack occurs. Of course, I'm worried about her , but is my parents' house alright too? I think that bad things will not happen, because my father is looking after him.



	February 17, 2097 (Sunday)

	This morning I analyzed the information that I received by this time from my father's people who help in the search. They work in places inaccessible to me, and in order for me to understand the situation and there was no misunderstanding, I was explained the details. The center of attention at the moment was the identification of possible routes for the evacuation of terrorists.

	Some time ago it became known that a cargo ship engaged in smuggling and bringing terrorists to the country is in the port of the city of Numazu. But it's probably just a bait. If I were to flee from Japan, I would really do it. Everyone had the same opinion. Just because you do not need to continue to hide in Japan. They will want to escape from Japan in any way. Here all also agreed.

	Further, there are two ways of leaving, on water and by air. If by air, then it will be just a disguise for a flight plane? Or they will have their own small plane? If this is a sea route, where will they go? Sagami Bay? The peninsula of Boso? You can also go secretly to the north and escape to the continent from the coast of the Niigata area.

	Various routes were expected, but we will not be able to control them all. Too many options, and the families of Saegusa and Juumonjiwill have to wait until the goal makes any obvious steps. I think it's right, but my young inexperienced head cannot just wait, it's so painful.

	In the afternoon I rode a motorcycle from Irozaki to Inubozaki along the coastline. I know that it's impossible to find anything by simply passing by, but I was hoping for an intuition that would give the signal on the spot. In fact, it was a good change in pace. But, despite this switching of feelings, the fact remains that we again could not find a clue. Actually, I do not want to connect too much to work the house, but after lunch I called George. He is the best adviser when I do not know what to do.

	George's opinion was that forcing terrorists to make their move is the best way to overcome the current situation. In other words, the "bait" operation. As the terrorists have their bait on the ship in Numazu, we will prepare our bait and catch them.

	The problem was who to use as bait. George, saying that the bait "should look weak," offered Shiba-san, Saegusau-san and Saegusau-san's younger sister. I can understand why women are more suited to bait. But I could not even think of putting her in a dangerous position. I suggested making myself a bait, but George objected to this. To such a dangerous bait, George said, hardly anyone will bite. Instead, George told me to think about a concrete plan.

	I'm counting on you, donor staff.



	February 18, 2097 (Monday)

	Really she really attacked !?

	Without exaggerating, I thought that my heart would stop when I heard the news. Saegusa-san told me that Shiba-san was attacked. On this occasion Shiba-san was invited to today's meeting. Sister Saegusa-san was also the target of the attackers, but we heard that they were both unharmed. But while I did not see her safe in the French restaurant at the meeting place, I was ill.

	When Shiba-san appeared accompanied by this guy, I, with relief, felt my heart ache. Soon I realized something. It's jealousy.

	In order to calm the controversial emotions, I asked if Shiba-san was alright. Although I was aware of jealousy, feelings of anxiety about her were really stronger. When she smiled and said that nothing bad had happened, I felt tension coming from all over the body.

	When the incident occurred, I had already finished school. The subordinates of my father met with informers, posing as subordinates of Zhou Gonjin. We did not expect to get any clues. We waited to be revealed, but in the end the leader of the terrorists did not show himself. I myself also participated. But I was far from the place to help Shiba-san when the attack occurred. For this guy everything should be the same. As expected, Shiba went from school to search even before me. Nevertheless, Shiba appeared to help her , attacked by bandits. I did not ask him how he could do it. I was very curious. But I did not dare to find out the reason. Instead, I asked the identity of the attacking enemy.

	The other side was a member of an anti-magical international organization, not only had Antinite, but also weapons, and used magic. No, as for magic, the enemy who attacked Shiba-san and the rest was used as the point of transfer of magic from the user of ancient magic. If you believe this guy.

	When I asked if he had found a manipulator, this guy replied that he had written down the magic and was working on it's analysis. Is this even possible? Does Yotsuba have such technology? I was surprised, but at the same time I felt peace of mind.

	He is ahead of us on missions thanks to the secret techniques of the Yotsuba family. Given this, I do not think I'm losing to him. Do not rush ahead, and everything will be fine. I thought about this trick.

	I asked: "How the hell did you record the magic?" - but this guy did not answer. It is natural. The Ten Master Clans are both partners and competitors at the same time. Publishing an expensive technology so that it can be used by another magician also increases the appreciation of the house. Influence in the magical world will also grow. If he cannot so simply answer the question, then there is a reason for that. But I felt that the reason was not alone. I felt that there was some kind of cunning. Maybe I'm just thinking too much. However, I apologized in advance that he did not say anything.

	It's not like me. In order not to say anything more wrong, I decided to continue to be only a listener.

	However, this guy, on Saegusa-san's offer to give her bodyguards, asked me: "Do you plan to use it as a bait?"

	No! I would never do that! If you need bait, I'll be her! So I answered him, raising my voice.

	Juumonji-san spoke in my defense, because before Shiba came we discussed my plan using bait to lure the terrorists. This guy though showed that he does not doubt my seriousness, but still it irritated me. It's not a joke, to suspect me of that.

	This is because this mission also does not progress. Even using the Ichijo family, and inventing a plan with a bait. It was a great pity that I could not just enjoy meeting her because of all these thoughts.

	But now the fulfillment of the mission has the highest priority. Tomorrow after school I planned to contact George immediately and get down to business. In fact, I wanted to call immediately, but today it's too late.



	February 19, 2097 (Tuesday)

	In any case, I'm tired. The date has almost changed, so I'll write it down tomorrow.



	February 20, 2097 (Wednesday)

	From today until Saturday, there will be no studies. First High was closed yesterday, and the third one was closed today, so I was at home this morning. Yesterday my mission ended. Although it is considered finished only preliminary, but I certainly have no reason to stay in Tokyo.

	The week in First High flew by unnoticed. I spent this time in the same class with her . It's a pity, of course, that I had to live alone for the Ten Master Clans. But the mission is over, and it would be wise to return to Kanazawa. There must be an offer to return from my father today. Let's look at what happened yesterday, waiting for him.

	Yesterday morning I conducted classes with a terminal in class 2A of First High. Alone. First High was closed yesterday, but I'm a student of Third High. I just used the terminal of First High. Therefore, in theory, I must also attend classes.

	As expected, the school building was closed. I hoped it was closed. When I came there, I was met by a teacher of class 2A. Apparently when closed to students, for teachers everything is different. Because of this, I had to study in class alone. There is a general phrase "little kindness, great care," but I thought it was "great kindness, great care." While I was studying, I was glad to see that she came to pick up something that remained.



	In the afternoon, Third High was also closed. I received a notice at the terminal, and I immediately returned to my home, from where I tried to contact George, who was supposed to go home after school in the same way. Unfortunately, George was out. I left a message and waited for a call back.

	The call was about two o'clock. But it was not George. Shiba Tatsuya. That guy. I was not very surprised by his words, probably because I had a premonition. He called about the mission, and he wanted to start preparing the capture operation, claiming he had found the place where the target was hiding. He did not tell me "will you take part?" or "accept, please, participation." He simply passed the time and place of the meeting.

	For me this was enough. In any case, how does the Yotsuba family receive such information? I did not ask such questions, but I felt that I first realized the threat of the untouchable Yotsuba family, which has a special status in the Ten Master Clans.



	The operation began at 18:00. To begin with, the Ichijo family were sent to block the retreat to the north, and they wanted to send me with them. But I wanted to pursue the goal. Finally, I was glad to hear that I was included in a separate special detachment of the Juumonji family. This guy was also included in this squad. The spirit of rivalry has raised my morale.



	The car with the magician of ancient magic, as expected, went directly to us. However, at the last moment, they did not enter the harbor, but turned west. We immediately arranged a pursuit, but at the exit from the harbor we were waiting for an ambush. When the enemy aimed at me, Shiba distracted him and told me to move on, and what he was going to sort out.

	It was not indecisiveness. I left this place on him, but I was wondering if I could take on the capture of the goal. I knew I had to hurry. I trusted the enemy ambush to Shiba and followed the target. It was the magic of this guy who seized the terrorist's location, but fortunately the target vehicle was already found. Without further doubt, I and the others increased speed, and pursued the goal.

	As a result, the car with the goal turned to a sandy beach and stopped in the middle of it. This again was an ambush. We were fired from behind with rifles of high power, created against magicians. Simple terrorists could not have such resources. At that time, I doubted that the terrorist incident of Hakone was a diversion of the Great Asian Alliance.

	The battle was tense, but Juumonji-san, who arrived in time, helped to defeat the enemy. When we decided that we had won, the enemy soldiers suddenly committed mass suicide. We were forced to abandon the chase to eliminate the fire. No, I was going to continue, but the goal was already at sea. I thought I wondered if I could catch up with him.

	And at that moment Saegusa-san appeared on the patrol boat, but after all she should not participate in the operation under the pretext of "this is dangerous"?

	It was like in a movie. However, this will be arrogance, blaming others for making things convenient for themselves. We boarded a patrol boat and pursued the target to the point where we could catch the target at a later stage.

	But we could not catch the terrorists. The ship with the purpose was sunk in front of us. A huge magic blade cut it in half. Was it a molecular divider? Why did such a magician appear in such a place, capable of such powerful magic, which is considered a trump card of the United States? At that time, I could not understand the situation at all. No, now I do not understand this either.

	In any case, we did not fulfill our mission, having failed at the last minute. Although the death of the target seemed to be reliable, since we cannot show the corpse, it cannot be declared in the media through the police. In the end, the Hakone terrorist incident ended, but was not disclosed.

	The main criminal is dead. But the matter is not decided. When I think about it, even I, a participant in the pursuit, did not see the goal in person. All that is known about him is the name of Gu Jie, a user of ancient magic from the former Dahan who owns the magic of manipulating corpses. I only know the fragmentary information, I cannot draw the whole image of the enemy. I cannot say with certainty if the user of ancient magic with the name of Gu Jie really exists, whether he is responsible for the terrorist attacks. I have nothing to convince the media.

	I was struck by a feeling of fatigue. Although I try to fight with drowsiness until 9 o'clock, fatigue is still showing itself. It's good that the school is closed. Today I will devote myself to rest.



	In the evening, there was a phone call from my father. Contrary to expectations, it was not said that I should return. Since there may be a case that the case is not decided definitively, it will take time to confirm this.

	Do not say stupid things! Thus, father can come to Tokyo himself when necessary. Our house is not so far from here.

	This week I will not go to school. My participation in First High is planned until early March.

	What is he thinking about? What does my father want me to do?

	I don't know. I feel exhausted because of fatigue. I'll talk to my father again tomorrow.



	February 21, 2097 (Thursday)

	Yesterday I was tired, and postponed complaints to my father. It was a failure. Today I called again to finish the meeting yesterday.

	It's all. Instead of any plans, the closing of the case seems to drag on for a long time. I'm lucky to be in Tokyo, and I do not go back to Kanazawa.

	Of course, the usual processing of data after a lost battle does not add motivation. But I did too! Really, how selfish.

	In addition, father dropped the bomb at the end of the conversation. On Saturday, Akane will arrive: "Show her Tokyo on Sunday." I do not even know the tourist attractions!



	February 22, 2097 (Friday)

	I think it's too late to write this in my diary, but I have two younger sisters. The oldest of them is Akane, the youngest is Ruri. According to the old custom of the mother's parental home, girls in the family should have names associated with flowers.

	Relations with my sisters are not very good, I think. George says that this is a "very close relationship," but I do not think so. It used to be nice before. Even now, I think I should protect them if something happens.

	They are pretty, but they are not nice to me. Ruri does not speak to me at all. Although the trend was there originally, recently she often remains silent even if I try to talk to her. Even if she opens her mouth to say something, this venomous tongue will give out just something like "shut up." Conversation cannot occur in such conditions.

	Akane, on the contrary, is talkative. This is very annoying. Is it really normal to break into my room under the pretext of bringing tea, coffee or snacks, and run away at once, with shouts of "how disgusting," "what sloppiness" or "what shame".

	A friend in Third High said that it was "Zundere", but he is funny because he does not suffer from this in reality. Initially, there was no such thing that Akane was delighted with me, and I do not have a hobby to be delighted with my sister.

	This annoying sister will be in this house tomorrow. Thanks to this, I had the opportunity to explore the sights here. If you do not prepare properly, Akane will make a lot of noise here. My nervous system has become accustomed to Akane's caustic words, but still it's annoying.

	However, there is no doubt that we will begin to explore the sights. Even with the recommended course, their number cannot fit into the fingers of both hands. At such times I hope to get advice from local residents. I also thought about a plan calling on her to provide her knowledge. But I did not have the courage to do this. It's terrible, to bother her with such trifles. Laugh if you want to laugh. Courage and recklessness are two different things.

	About this guy is out of the question. I do not want to be indebted to him for such a thing.

	Yoshida and Saijou, I think they will not refuse to help, but will there be any sense from these guys in compiling the route that the high school student will like? In the end, after all my thinking, I thought about Saegusa-san. Not about the eldest son of the family, Tomokazuan-san. And about Mayumi-san. We have met many times recently, and I thought that she might know many places that will please Akane.

	Saegusa-san certainly gave me a lot of useful information. But now I'm a little sorry that I rely on her.

	I felt not familiar enough to call, so I just sent a message.

	"My sister is suddenly coming to Tokyo the day after tomorrow I will accompany her, I would like to receive advice on where to go."

	Approximately such a message I wrapped up the courtesies and sent it. After 30 minutes I received a response. A quick answer confused me, because unlike magical schools, the University of Magic had to go to school right now.

	My doubts were ridiculous. The message contained an explanation: "I did not go to university, because there were many cases in the morning to eliminate the consequences of the incident." In the second half, the schedule was free, so I'm happy to respond to your message. " I copied and inserted this word for word, it was not a mistake. Saegusa-san already considers me a close friend?

	I shook my head.

	If you read further, it says, "I want to help, so I want to hear the story in more detail, and if you do not mind, come to my house."

	I, in the house of the Saegusa family? It's pretty sudden, I thought, and reread the message. Incidentally, when I arrived in Tokyo, I never visited the family of Saegusa or the family of Juumonji. For the eldest son of the Ichijo family, this is not a very good behavior. Despite the fact that my father seems to be planning to give control of the family not to me, but to Akane's future husband, I'm still a representative of the Ichijo family in Tokyo.

	We are also from the Ten Master Clans, but in fact, we are in a foreign territory. But being on the same front side by side, we managed to establish some connections. I agreed to an invitation and decided to go and greet the Saegusa family.

	I also thought about putting on a suit, but in the end I put on the uniform of Third High and went to the house of the Saegusa family on public transport, not on a motorcycle. On the way, I also bought a souvenir at a price that would not be embarrassing. This is the usual courtesy format, I was not against it. "Sometimes the price is of great importance," my mother told me.

	Upon arrival in the mansion, I was met by Saegusa-san herself, probably because I had sent the arrival time in advance. Since the head of the family, Mr. Koichi, was at home, I should first of all greet him. Indeed, I almost made such a mistake by imprudence.

	[note. In the original Masaki, at the mention of Koichi, the nominal suffix -氏 (-shi) is used, which is usually translated as Mr. or Mr.]

	As my father said, he did not look like a man of the type who would cold-bloodedly betray an ally. You can call it impermanent, that is, a person appointing his own rules, and assigning his priority to them. I still do not know how to evaluate people in appearance.

	The eldest son of Tomokazu was absent. Saegusa-san, no, here for the sake of clarity, I will call her Mayumi-san. As she told me, her two older brothers live separately from the family.

	I finished my greeting to Mr. Koichi and was taken to another living room. My family home is big, but the house of the Saegusa family can be bigger. Perhaps the area of our house seems bigger, but it feels like it loses inside.

	In the reception area, where I was greeted by Mr. Koichi, couches were installed, but in the waiting room that Mayumi-san gave me after that, there were elegant tables and chairs that made it possible to eat and drink. Perhaps she wanted to arrange a tea ceremony. I wonder if my sisters will do such a thing?

	By the time I finished Mr. Koichi's greetings, the preparation of the table had also been completed. Mayumi-san treated me like a good friend, offered tea and sweets, and also eagerly inquired about the age of Akane, her preferences, tastes and hobbies. For the first time, I realized how kind she was. Of course, during the previous communication this was already noticeable. But was she really bored now? Did she call me to just kill time?

	In this reception there was also a large display. When I entered the room, he showed the famous landscape painting. I think it was Renoir. I do not know the names, but this is a picture of a boat floating in the river.

	I was given the opportunity to use this display to participate in a "virtual meeting". It seems this was a service that allows you to choose conversations and actions from options on the terminal, and showing the same landscapes that you would see while walking around the real city. If you use it for a real date, then it can be boring, since real romance disappears, but apparently this service was popular among women.

	Well, of course, this will show us the sights in the form of a realistic CG with almost no differences from the real places, so you can avoid that the situation will be different from what I thought. However, if you do a preliminary check, you do not need options. I'll just hold my sister in the planned places, it will not be a date.

	What I wanted was not dating advice. Despite this, I could not unceremoniously drop the assistance offered to me. Whatever I thought, it was not a game. Looking back, I remembered that Mayumi-san wrote: "I'm glad that I had free time." It must have been literally that I was killing her time.

	Here the younger sisters of Mayumi-san joined us, and this only added to me a headache. I thought my mind would break. No, it could be broken three or four times.

	But thanks to common efforts, the route for Akane was compiled. After that, I said goodbye and left the residence of the Saegusa family, but mentally, I was exhausted. Anyway, I felt that I would not want to talk for a long time.



	So they were the younger sisters of Mayumi-san, Kasumi-chan and Izumi-chan? I wonder what impression I left with these two?



	February 23, 2097 (Saturday)

	Today I had a pleasant surprise. Not only Akane came to Tokyo. George also came to stay. I have not seen him in two weeks, but I feel that quite a long time has passed.

	Akane laughed at our warm reunion, but friendship has priority over the relationship of brothers and sisters, understand this, stupid sister. Akane said anything, like "abomination" or "perverts", but in the end, she left me alone.

	Akane wanted to go to tea in a suitable restaurant, not paying attention to fatigue from the long road. I took her and George to the well-established Sukiyaki restaurant, founded in 1869. As expected, the taste was excellent. George was pleased. However, Akane complained: "I was expecting home-cooked meals." - But then, were not we supposed to stay at home and use our kitchen?

	Back home, we talked a lot. It's too late now, and there's no time to write everything down.



	February 24, 2097 (Sunday)

	Today, the trouble entrusted to my father fell on me - an excursion for Akane, the route for which Mayumi-san helped to compose. However, because of the behavior of Akane plans were canceled. This younger sister said a strange: "Today I will be engaged in home cooking", and in the morning stayed in the kitchen.

	And what should we do in the morning? In the kitchen, suddenly, there was almost no food, so breakfast was toast with butter.

	The cooking of Akane was finally completed at noon. The manager of this house took care of the products, so we did not have to run after them ourselves.

	The taste was normal. Although it was not unpleasant, I did not think it was delicious. But still. Akane made rice with curry. Using semi-processed seasonings. Hey, develop there is already a normal taste, so that people can feel like a professional chefs. Seasoning curry, you can eat almost anything, because curry has its own too strong taste.

	Apparently caring about the feelings of my younger sister, George called it "yummy," and Akane, although she looked satisfied, but said: "I do not think it worked out well."

	Since the whole morning was spent on Akane's cooking, I was forced to shorten the route of the excursion. The plan that I received, having passed the test of the Saegusa sisters, was spoiled.

	Thinking about this, I decided to complete the route at the station to send them home. When I asked Akane and George to collect bags with things, I got the question "why?" from a stupid sister. I was going to send the luggage by the delivery service when I would have returned, sending these two home. I also wanted to hear why this question was asked.

	It turned out that Akane is not very interested in the excursion. "My friends and I will still come here on spring or summer vacations," she said. It looks like this time she came to this house to ask me to invite my friends.

	Father ... Because of your misunderstanding, I was turned into a toy in the house of the Saegusa family. When I consoled the insults in my heart, this Akane said: "Moreover, there are certain people whom I would like to see." You need to warn about such things, you know, in advance. The convenience of the other side should also be taken into account. But when I heard the name with whom Akane "would like to see", my heart was filled with feelings.

	She wanted to meet Shiba-san. I repeatedly rejected this request. I said, give up, because it's impossible. But Akane was not convinced. "At least communication on a videophone," she asked. In the end, everything ended in rude statements in my direction, that I am a loser who even is afraid to call.

	Oh well. Now I'll call. She asked for it.

	Under the supervision of Akane and George, I could not just escape, and sent a call to Shiba-san's number. A young girl in a maid costume appeared on the screen. It was a familiar face. First year from the school board of First High. Was I wrong with the number? But the girl said: "Yes, Shiba's house, I'm listening to you." Feeling relieved that I was not mistaken, I introduced myself: "My name is Ichijo."

	Is this guy a cosplayer, dresses freshmen in different costumes? Is he doing this with Shiba-san, too? Now I argue calmly, and I know that at that moment I was wrong. From the point of view of a third party, I, as a suspect of such things, are more like those who have such hobbies.

	Shiba-san is the future head of the Yotsuba family. Having a servant in the house is perfectly normal. The thought that she is a maid is ten times more reasonable than the thought that she will cosplay a maid. At my request to talk to her , the maid girl did not ask the topic of the conversation and put the videophone on standby.

	Soon, from the speaker, I heard her voice: "It's Shiba. Ichijo-san, it's been 5 days since our meeting." I plunged into excitement, which was unusual for my character. She remembered when we last saw each other. It is a pity that the display did not transmit the image, but it was not uncommon when calling in a private house. Especially for women there is a strong tendency not to like to show themselves to the opposite sex in home clothes.

	But even her voice was more than enough. I struggled to keep myself in hand. I talked about a sister who came to Tokyo, who wants to see Shiba-san, and apologized for the suddenness and for taking up her time, which she kindly agreed to. Although the condition was the presence of this guy, I knew that there was nothing to be done. Even though we did not have such circumstances, I consider this to be normal, for a young girl to come to such a meeting not alone.

	As a meeting point, a café was chosen near First High, and not one of our houses. A cafe called "Eine Brise". Considering the speed of modern public transport, it will not take long to get there.

	I saw her for the first time in 5 days, she seemed to be shining. I felt around her a different atmosphere. Akane also watched her, speechless. Despite the fact that she was completely taken aback when she introduced herself to her acquaintance, no one laughed at her. Her charm was beyond the sexes.

	George was talking animatedly with Shiba. Maybe it seemed to me, but Shiba also seemed to enjoy talking with George. In their conversation, complicated phrases like "modularity of the activation sequence" or "a similar phenomenon in another system" slipped through, but it was good that George seemed to find himself an interlocutor of interests. Thanks to George, distracting this guy, I finally managed to talk to her .

	The meeting ended in about an hour, and we took a walk in the neighborhood of Shibuya Harajuku, returned to the family house in Tokyo. I suggested that they send the baggage, but it looks like they wanted to take it with them. After leading them to the door of the house, I left Akane for George, and we parted.

	Then I heard Akane's impressions of her , and they seemed strange to me. "It was scary," said the sister. I asked, "Who, Shiba-san?" - to which she shook her head. Apparently it's this guy. Even in my eyes, he behaved like a gentleman with Akane. His appearance, of course, gives a sharp impression, but much more terrible people visited our parental home. That is, Shiba's features did not have to scare her.
