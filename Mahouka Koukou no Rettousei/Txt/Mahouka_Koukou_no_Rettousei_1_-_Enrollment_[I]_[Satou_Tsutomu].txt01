It looked like he was trying to ignore everything in that direction, which was probably his greatest concession from an emotional standpoint. For this, Tatsuya was extremely thankful.

Mayumi hastily batted her hand. Exactly what that was for, or what meaning it was trying to convey…? Among the people that Tatsuya had already met, she was probably the hardest to understand.

That should probably be tabled for a later date.

After much difficulty (largely persuasion), Tatsuya was able to free his wrist, and obediently followed Mari.

In the room’s farthest corner, in a spot where there would normally be a fire escape, there was instead a staircase leading to the Public Moral Committee HQ.

Are we ignoring fire safety standards?

Tatsuya ruminated on this, but even if the students were learning on the job, or even brand new, as long as there were excellent Magicians on hand, the lack of firefighting equipment shouldn’t have been a problem. Simply using vibration or speed magics was enough to put out a fire, then the use a combination of Gather-Move Smoke Magic would be enough to expel it. In truth, large scale fires in tall skyscrapers were yet another area that Magicians could display their skills.

Given that the lack of an elevator was within the boundaries of fire safety, the rest can be forgiven, Tatsuya thought.

In regards to Tatsuya, who was right on her heels through the door into the headquarters, Mari pointed towards the chairs next to the table, and said,

“It’s a little bit of a mess. You can rest there for a second.”

So this only qualified as a little. That being said, it was not like there was no place to put one’s foot down, or that all the chairs were covered with luggage. It was probably because they just came from the neat and tidy Student Council Room, so this image was especially jarring, but that was as much as could be expected.

Books, portable terminals, and even CADs, all sorts of items covered the table. Tatsuya slightly cleared out a space on one of the half-pulled out chairs beside the table.

“The Public Moral Committee Room is like a bachelor’s home. Even though I’ve told them to pick up after themselves time and time again, there’s still no one who listens…”

“It can’t be helped when no one is around.”

Not knowing if Tatsuya’s comment was out of mockery or comfort, Mari wrinkled her brow upon hearing this.

“…Our primary objective is patrolling school grounds. The state of affairs within HQ couldn’t be avoided.”

Presently, there were only two people in the room. The Public Moral Committee consisted of nine people, but the space within the room could accommodate a group of people many times greater than the current roster. Within this space, the idle atmosphere and dispersed items only served to increase the sense of uncleanliness.

What drew Tatsuya’s attention, aside from the obvious messiness of the room, were the cluttered objects on the table.

“Even so, Chief, would it be okay if I tidied up a bit?”

“What…”

At Tatsuya’s sudden proposal, Mari raised an eyebrow in surprise. —Surprise was well within a senpai’s acting repertoire.

“As someone aiming to be a Magic Artificer, I can’t stand it when I see CADs scattered around like this. I have the same stance towards abandoned or disabled terminals.”

Because of this, Tatsuya’s priorities in task management had changed.

“Aiming to be a Magic Artificer? Even with that level of anti-personnel combat capability?”

At Tatsuya’s words, Mari earnestly tilted her head a bit. From the recent contest, despite the brief time that had elapsed, the level of anti-personnel combat was superb.

“No matter how hard I try, my abilities can get me to a C-Rank License at best.”

But, just as if he was discussing someone else’s affairs, Tatsuya mildly used a self-depreciating comment to counter Mari. Mari was too astonished to find any words to rebut that.

In most countries, Magicians operated under the licensing system. The system was based on international standards, from which this country was not an exception. It doesn’t matter if you work for the corporations, the government, or even open a private practice, the difficulty and need both reflect upon the level of licensure. Magicians with higher licensing levels received a higher level of compensation; this is the rule of society.

International licenses have 5 levels between A and E.

Selection and ranking are based on Magic Sequence design and usage speeds, scale, and interference strength, which were the exact same scales used in high school technical skills testing. In other words, the educational technical skills grading scale was designed to naturally lead into international licensing standards.

There is a separate, special set of standards for law enforcement and the military, but at the end of the day, those standards are for “law enforcement” or “military types”, and not designed to measure Magicians.

“…So, it’s okay if I clean up this area?”

“Ah? Hm, I’ll help too. We can talk while we work.”

Mari hurriedly stood up, probably because she was the type that naturally looked after other people.

Or maybe it was because just sitting there watching Tatsuya toil away at the piles of books was simply rude.

While both of them worked at similar speeds, when compared to the empty space in front of Tatsuya, the pile in front of Mari did not decrease in size, and the surface of the table still wasn’t visible.

Tatsuya gave it a brief glance.

And let out a small sigh.

Mari stopped her hands in a clear sign of surrender.

“Sorry, I’m really bad at this type of work.”

She might bear the biggest responsibility for the state of the room, Tatsuya thought.

That only remained in his thoughts and was not verbalized, given that he was a mature adult… maybe.

“Speaking of which, you’re quite familiar with those.”

“What are you referring to?”

“The book categories. I thought you were just going to put them somewhere else, but I didn’t expect you to sort them by subject.”

“…Excuse me, sitting on the table is a little…”

In a sudden change of attitude, Mari sat down on the table in the open area that Tatsuya cleared away, looking at the disorganized pile of books. Her dress was directly touching Tatsuya’s wrist. The cloth subtly covered the thigh area, leading to a charming pair of slim legs. Even though the flesh was completely covered, the outline left nothing to imagination, thus rendering that position a terrible distraction to mental state.

“Ah, sorry.”

Needless to say, Mari’s voice did not show a trace of apologetic tone. —Any intentional response would only bring about the reverse effect, thus proving the idiom, silence is golden.

He dug out the bookcase from the pile of books, and placed them properly on the shelves. In this day and age, both paper-based books and bookshelves are considered rarities.

Not to mention that they were magical texts.

“In terms of why we scouted you — on this matter, we went over this earlier. It is to properly adjudicate cases of improper magic usage, and to improve the perception of Course 2 students.”

“I remember, but I think that this tactic may cause considerable backlash… May I take a look at this book?”

After sorting the books, the terminals still needed work. After asking Mari for permission to examine the data, to which Mari had nodded in agreement, Tatsuya restored the terminal to working order, cut the power, shifted the terminal to storage mode, and gathered the parts in one area.

“Why do you think that way?”

“Even though we never mentioned this aloud, if an underclassman were apprehended by someone of equal standing, this would naturally lead to negative reactions.”

He left the seat, and began searching the cabinets by the wall.

After placing the terminal within an empty cabinet, he heard a completely irresponsible comment of “That’s true” coming from behind him.

“But at the same time, 1st Year students would welcome this change. Haven’t your fellow students talked about this?”

“Yes…”

After sorting the terminals, he looked towards other cabinets.

“I think that if a Course 1 student took over, the negative reaction would outnumber the welcoming reaction.”

After locating the target, Tatsuya straightened himself, rotating his shoulders before taking off his jacket and rolling up his sleeves.

“Resentment is likely inevitable. But in regard to newly enrolled Course 1 students, they might not have been exposed to the discriminating thinking long enough to become prejudiced, right?”

“Who knows?”

The object that Tatsuya carefully removed from the cabinet seemed to be a CAD case.

“Just yesterday I ran into the ‘I don’t acknowledge you’ declaration.”

After wrapping the grounded protector around his sleeveless wrist, he reached his hand towards the pile of CADs.

“Thank goodness you carry even this type of equipment… Was that person Morisaki?”

“This is quite convenient… You know him too?”

“The teachers recommended him to join the committee.”

“Eh?”

The hand that was examining the CAD status faltered slightly.

He hastily picked up the CAD that fell to the ground.

“So even you can be surprised.”

“Of course.”

In response to Mari’s laughter, Tatsuya’s response was colored by his sighing tone.

If only there was a way to undercut all this antagonism…

“Due to yesterday’s ruckus, there are grounds for withdrawing the recommendation, which was what I planned to do, but yesterday’s event had nothing to do with you.”

“I was involved as well.”

“Well then, if we were able to recruit you, it would be much harder to reject him.”

“Why not simply take neither of us, what do you think?”

“Do you dislike it?”

Upon receiving such a direct question, Tatsuya stopped the work of his hands.

Temporarily, he put the CAD back into the box, and raised his head.

Mari was sitting on the table looking downwards at Tatsuya’s face without a smile on her face.

Her slender and delicate gaze seemed to see right through Tatsuya.

“…To tell the truth, I find it very troublesome.”

“Hm… And?”

“Despite thinking that it’s troublesome, I don’t plan on backing out at this point.”

Mari’s face once more revealed her delighted smirk.

Her devilish expression seemed to have increased her beauty two-fold.

“Senpai is the type of person who hates trouble too…”

“You’re also the type who likes to cut corners.”

Alas, Tatsuya could only admit that she won that round.




“…This is the Public Moral Committee’s HQ, right?”

That was Mayumi’s first question after descending the stairs.

“That was quite the unexpected greeting.”

“What, this is all because of you, Mari. No matter how many times Rin-chan reminds you or how much A-chan begs you, you still haven’t cleaned up the place.”

“I object to your hurtful and inaccurate description of the situation, Mayumi! It’s not that I don’t want to clean up, but that I haven’t started yet!”

“As a woman, you should pay more attention to this.”

Mayumi narrowed her eyes as she squinted at Mari, who hurriedly turned around.

“It’s not like I don’t want to… Ah, that.”

Upon seeing Tatsuya busily examining a terminal’s internal condition after removing the protective cover, Mayumi displayed an understanding expression as she nodded.

“So it’s because he’s been put to good use already.”

“Meh, just so.”

Mari’s back was still facing Mayumi as she replied, just as Tatsuya closed the protective cover and turned around.

“Chief, the inspections are complete. The damaged parts have already been replaced. There should be no more problems.”

“Good work.”

Mari nodded quickly, but maybe he was reading too much into it, because Tatsuya thought he could see sweat beads on Mari’s temple.

Cold sweat.

“Eh… So you address Mari as Chief, which means we have successfully recruited you.”

“I thought I never had the right to refuse in the first place…”

Tatsuya didn’t even look at Mayumi’s teasing expression, and deadpanned his response.

Mayumi looked like she disapproved of Tatsuya’s attitude. She placed one hand on her hips, raised the other forefinger, directing her most displeased gaze towards him as she was about to unleash her most exaggerated attitude to voice her objection.

“Tatsuya-kun, isn’t your response to your older sister simply too rude?”

…In short, the way Tatsuya framed his response was because he didn’t have an older sister. If he admitted this aloud, Tatsuya felt that the situation would only grow worse, so he did not verbalize it.

No matter where it started or where it ended, it was so archetypal that no real response was possible.

If anything, Mayumi’s attitude towards him was overly casual, Tatsuya thought to himself.

He had entered this type of situation with similar impressions in the past, and managed to sidestep the issue every time. This time however, Tatsuya somehow felt that he was unable to do so.

“President, just in case, I want to clarify one thing with you.”

“Hm, what is it?”

“We met for the first time just before the enrollment ceremony, right?”

It goes without saying that meeting for the first time might constitute an overly familiar attitude, not to mention all the additional meanings behind those words, as Mayumi’s eyes widened upon hearing them. However, they quickly reverted to their normal size and narrowed even more, to the point that her expression could only be described as “wicked”.

Tatsuya finally realized what a terrible move he made.

Just before, Mari had a very similar facial expression, now that Tatsuya thought about it. So, this must be what people mean by birds of a feather flock together, Tatsuya thought as he wished he could escape reality.

“Is this how it is… Ho ho ho ho ho.”

Tiny devil would be a perfectly appropriate description for that smiling face.

“Tatsuya-kun thinks that we’ve met before, right? And the day of the enrollment ceremony must be our fateful reunion!”

“No, wait, President?”

Exactly why were the tensions rising so quickly?.

“A long time ago we might have met once, then thrust apart by cruel fate, only to be united by destiny once more!”

If she was really reveling in those words, she would be a dangerous person. But if she was acting this entire sequence out while purposefully allowing everyone else to know she was acting, there was something terribly wrong with that kind of personality.

“…Unfortunately, that was undoubtedly our first meeting.”

“…I thought so too.”

“I say, I say, unless you really got those fateful meeting vibes?”

Mayumi clasped her hands in front of her chest and pressed her face closer towards Tatsuya. —She looked very excited, but in reality she was fooling around. This suited her quite well… Truly, a terrible personality.

“…Sorry, why are you so happy about this?”

Even if he used a question to answer a question, he wouldn’t receive an answer.

The only thing he received was that gaze filled with expectations.

She is an “S”, Tatsuya jotted down in his mental notebook.

Seizing the opportunity, Tatsuya replied.

“…If this is destiny, then it definitely isn’t fate, and looks more like doom.”

Tatsuya’s reply caused Mayumi’s face to darken as she turned around. “Is that so…?” A lonely muttering meandered to Tatsuya’s ear.

Dark clouds of depression gathered behind her back.

Tatsuya also felt that he might have gone too far. Even though his response was based on his estimation that Mayumi was completely teasing him, if there was a shade of sincerity in them, then he needed to apologize.

However…

There was no way to tell if it was good luck or bad, but the sense of guilt didn’t linger for too long.

That was probably due to confusion, given the circumstances.

“…Tch.”

As her shoulders slumped slightly, Mayumi’s lips dropped a sound that could only mean a sense of defeat.

It was Tatsuya’s turn to widen his eyes.

It was only a small sound to be sure, and not graceful in any way, but could still be identified.

“Um, President?”

“Hm, what is it?”

Mayumi turned around to face Tatsuya; her elegant smile would have charmed any newly enrolled male student.

“…Why do I feel like I understand you a little better now, President?”

Feeling utterly exhausted, Tatsuya thought that he glimpsed Mayumi’s real face behind the mask.

And that is, a smiling face that loved to tease others.

“It’s about time to stop the jokes. Tatsuya-kun, too much leisure time can be a bad thing.”

Towards Mayumi, who was completely guiltless and treated the entire thing as a joke, Mari said,

“You can’t use the same tricks you used on Hattori, Mayumi. Your appearance doesn’t work on him.”

Mari took the opportunity to throw in her two cents.

“Don’t describe others in such an evil manner. It’s as if I like messing with underclassmen.”

Unable to ignore the previous comment, Mayumi’s answer became a little heated.

“Regarding what I just heard…”

Tatsuya deeply regretted opening his mouth with prior consideration, and began to clean up again. If he stayed too long in the miasma spread by the others, he would definitely suffer additional damage.

“The difference in Mayumi’s attitude is because she’s already acknowledged you, Tatsuya-kun.

She probably considers the two of you to be quite alike in some areas.

In other words, she’s playing coy. She only takes off her mask in front of the people she acknowledges.”

At Mari’s oddly solemn expression, Tatsuya felt a sense of unease.

“Don’t believe what Mari says, Tatsuya-kun.

But, I guess I do acknowledge you.

It feels like I can’t deal with you the same way I treat the others.

Maybe the one touched by fate is me.”

Hearing this, and seeing Mayumi’s smiling face that no sane man could hate, Tatsuya’s internal pace had been completely disrupted.

Looks like challenging these two directly from the front would be an exercise in futility, Tatsuya thought.




The reason Mayumi came to visit was actually to inform them that the Student Council Room was closing early. She was only supposed to check on Tatsuya in passing, but that had quickly become her primary objective before long. It probably wasn’t a good idea to dwell too long on that subject.

Since the end of the enrollment ceremony, many different action items had also come to a head. “Then, I’m going ahead.” Mayumi waved and walked towards the Student Council Room.

Tomorrow marked the first day of the competition for new club members, so the activity level of the Public Moral Committee was going to increase as well. Mayumi’s conversation with Mari and Tatsuya ended at this point.

Current information systems, much like their predecessors, required very little time to operate.

Several of them needed to be shut down, but even if this step was overlooked, they would still automatically enter sleep mode.

The only thing that needed to be done at this point was set safety protocols, but at this opportune moment — or maybe unfortunate moment - two male students entered the Public Morale Committee headquarters.

“Hi.”

“Good morning!”

A vibrant greeting spread throughout the room.

“Oi, Nee-san, can we come in?”

Where the heck is this, and what year are we in? Tatsuya thought.

The subject in question was not overly tall, but possessed a sturdy build, with shortly cropped hair that was very suited for a headband. And to so casually use “Nee-san”, he had to be referring to—

(Must be Watanabe-senpai…)

Tatsuya glanced briefly at Mari, who was a little embarrassed.

The fact that she still retained (at the very least) some sense of normalcy brought a ridiculous amount of relief to Tatsuya. “Chief, today’s patrol is done! No arrests!”

When compared to the other guy, this one had a bland appearance and his speech pattern was quite normal, but filled with an imposing manner. The unmoving stance he took while giving his report reminded people of a soldier, or maybe a police officer, or someone part of a system that had largely remained unchanged over the years.

“…You’re telling me that Nee-san cleaned this room?”

At the abrupt changes in the activity room, the sturdy one could not conceal his surprise as he walked towards Tatsuya.

There shouldn’t have been a major difference in weight, but amazingly, his footsteps were incredibly slow in comparison.

Just as the boy passed in front of Mari, she casually stood up, looked towards him—

“A-ya!”

SPA! There was a sound that was pleasing to the ear, just as the boy crouched down and covered his head.

Mari held a notebook rolled into a rod.

When did she pull that out?

“Don’t call me Nee-san! How many times do I have to tell you for you to remember?! Koutarou, is your brain a decoration?!”

Tatsuya had not yet sorted through his confusion, but Mari had already roared her displeasure at the boy covering his head.

“Please don’t hit me on the head, Nee… No, Chief. Speaking of which, who’s this? The rookie?”

It probably didn’t hurt that much, despite the yammering of the boy named Koutarou. However, noticing the moving rolled-up notebook, he quickly changed Nee-san to Mari’s official title.

In front of Koutarou, who had gone rigid in nervousness, Mari lowered her shoulders and sighed.

“…It’s just as you said, he’s the rookie. 1st Year Class E Shiba Tatsuya. Recommended by the Student Council.”

“Eh… There’s no insignia.”

Koutarou was very excited as he examined Tatsuya’s coat, while at the same time checking out Tatsuya’s build.

“Tatsumi-senpai, that’s violating the ban on certain words! At this time, I think Course 2 student would be the proper description.”

The other boy, despite saying this on the outside, could not disguise his coldly analytical body language. “The two of you should be careful. That kind of thinking may lead to a world of hurt in battle? I’ll only say it once. He just thrashed Hattori.”

However, just as Mari said this with a teasing smile on her face, the two boys’ expressions became grave.

“…This guy, took out Hattori?”

“Yes, in a formal duel.”

“What! The undefeated Hattori, losing to a newcomer.”

“No need to shout, Sawaki. Didn’t I just say that?”

Tatsuya was not pleased at being stared at for so long, but these were not just upperclassmen, but his seniors in the Public Moral Committee. He just had to bear with it for a little longer.

“This guy is quite determined.”

“He’s got potential, Chief.”

Like musicians recovering from a disrupted rhythm, their gazes changed. Almost as if they could change appearances on cue.

“Surprised?”

“Hm?”

The question was too vague, so it was hard to tell what was being asked, but it didn’t seem like Mari expected Tatsuya to answer anyways.

“This school is filled with people immersed in the idea that labeling Blooms and Weeds determines their superiority. To be honest, I hate that. So I am very pleased with the outcome of today’s match.

Thankfully, Mayumi and Juumonji both understand my personality. Thus, the members recommended by the Student Council and the Club Management Group aren’t people brainwashed into that sort of thinking. While I can’t say that there’s no sense of superiority here, we’re all people that can objectively evaluate another person’s skills.

Unfortunately, the three students recommended by the teachers are rather from the former category, so there’s nothing we can do about it, but I think this place wouldn’t be a bad fit for you.”

“3rd Year Class C Tatsumi Koutarou. Welcome aboard Shiba. If you got the skills, you’re fine in my book.”

“2nd Year Class D Sawaki Midori. Welcome to our group, Tatsuya-kun.”

Koutarou and Sawaki both reached out a hand. Just as Mari said, there wasn’t a hint of insult in their expression. Their earlier evaluation was simply to see if Tatsuya had any ability, and whether he was a Course 1 or Course 2 student made no difference to them, Tatsuya finally understood this.

He had to admit he was somewhat surprised. Indeed, this wasn’t a bad atmosphere.

He returned their greeting and shook Koutarou’s hand. For some reason, the hand wasn’t released.

“Juumonji is from the Club Management Group. You can refer to him as Group Leader Juumonji.”

Was it just to tell me that? You could’ve told me that after you released my hand.

“I’m up next. Please refer to me by my family name Sawaki.”

Upon feeling pressure on his hand, Tatsuya’s consciousness was pulled back to reality.

His grip strength had increased to the point where you could hear the movement, Tatsuya was surprised to find.

This school had excellent students, and not just solely in the magic department.

“Don’t call me by my name.”

That appeared to be the warning.

There was no need for such a roundabout warning, as Tatsuya was not in the habit of referring to upperclassmen by name, but since Sawaki took time to specifically mention this, he should respond as well.

“I’ll remember that.”

At the same time these words were spoken, his right hand was released.

Upon seeing Tatsuya’s physical skills, Koutarou’s surprise surpassed Sawaki’s own.

“Ho, that’s quite impressive. Sawaki’s grip strength is at least in the triple digits.”

“…I think that hardly qualifies as normal physical abilities, even for Magicians.”

Tatsuya pretended not to know, giving only a light response.

He was probably going to get along quite well with these two -- Tatsuya thought.





Chapter 4




When compared to traditional auxiliary equipment such as magic staves, tomes, or talismans, CADs possessed superior invocation speed, refinement, complexity, and were capable of executing large scale magics. They were the definitive auxiliary equipment in the modern age.

That being said, they weren’t universally superior in all categories when compared to traditional auxiliary equipment.

Due to the precise nature of CADs, when compared to traditional auxiliary equipment, maintenance required additional effort.

This was especially the case when dealing with the compatibility between the user’s Psion wave motions and the Receive-Release System.

CAD utilized the Psions released by Magicians as raw materials (it may be more appropriate to describe it as the ink for paintings), directed towards the Activation Sequence in the Psion Information Aide, where Magicians then use their own physical bodies as a conductor for reading the Activation Sequence before plugging the result into the magic design. Depending on the quality of CAD maintenance, this could influence the speed of magic invocation anywhere between 50-100%.

In other words, Psions are particles of thought or consciousness made concrete. Their manifestation can be extremely diverse. For every hundred people there would be a hundred different types, and a thousand users would create a thousand types. Every individual has a unique Psion wave motion, so if the CAD wasn’t finely tuned to their specific use, the user would encounter difficulty managing the exchange of Psions.

Besides that, there are many essential points that lead to a custom fit CAD.

These would fall under the purview of the Magic Artificers charged with CAD maintenance, and the reason why exceptionally skilled Magic Artificers were seen as coveted treasures.

In addition, the fluctuations of Psion wave motions reflect the growth of the physical body, such as changes as a result of age, and are subsequently affected. In fact, these fluctuations could change daily.

Thus, the ideal situation would call for daily maintenance based on the user’s physical status, but CAD maintenance requires equipment that is extremely expensive.

Generally, only the military, police, central government, first class research institutes, famous schools, and well-financed major corporations possess the power and funding for CAD maintenance equipment and related trained personnel, an impossible scenario for small to mid-sized companies or personal use. Magicians in the latter categories resort to using Magic Machine Customization Stores once a month, or Mechanical Service Stores once or twice for scheduled check-ups.

First High was also considered to be one of the country’s premiere schools, and thus naturally possessed special facilities for student use. It was a common sight to see students or faculty undergoing CAD maintenance on campus.

However, due to special circumstances, Tatsuya’s house also contained state of the art CAD maintenance equipment.




After dinner, in the basement that had been converted into a CAD maintenance room, Tatsuya turned around upon hearing the only other occupant in the house speak.

“It’s okay, go ahead and come in. It’s about time I took a break.”

That statement wasn’t a lie, probably because Miyuki had waited for a period of time to elapse before attempting to speak with him.

“Excuse me. Onii-sama, I was hoping you could adjust my CAD…”

She was holding a cellphone-shaped CAD.

On her approach, the soft, pleasant smell of soap buffeted the senses.

She was wearing a simple, large velvet robe, something commonly seen during medical examinations.

“Are the settings incompatible?”

That apparel was for someone intent on maintenance.

“That’s impossible! Onii-sama’s adjustments are always perfect.”

Because her response was always superlative accolades, there was little point in telling her to change. From previous experience, Tatsuya knew that trying to do so was pointless.

However, the last time they did a full maintenance was 3 days ago. Usually, they only did a full maintenance once a week unless there was an urgent reason, thought Tatsuya.

“It’s just, that…”

“Don’t worry about it. Go ahead and say it like you used to.”

“Sorry, I actually wanted Onii-sama to help me change a few Activation Sequences…”

“What, just that. It’s nothing to worry about. I was getting worried for a bit.”

He softly brushed his sister’s hair and took the CAD from her hands.

Miyuki dipped her head in embarrassment.

“So, what systems do you want to add?”

General CADs were limited to 99 registered Activation Sequences. Even for Miyuki’s highly customized CAD, this was an insurmountable limit.

The variability of Activation Sequences were dependent on where the Activation Sequence combination ended and where the individual’s Magic Calculation Area began in terms of execution. In reality, there were unlimited combinations.

Generally speaking, targets, strength, and ending requirements were set as variables to be executed by the Magic Calculation Area; all other essentials would be incorporated into the Activation Sequence. However, it was not rare to see strength as the Activation Sequence quantity to reduce hydrochloric acid execution to increase Invocation Speed. Many Defensive-Type Magics relied on using the self as a physical marker in relation to the target, whereas Contact-Type Magic quantifies all the numbers. All these were introduced in the practical skills class.

Miyuki belonged to the minority who registered a wide variety of low fixed quantity, highly flexible Activation Sequences.

For fifteen year old Miyuki, who could grasp magical skills far beyond what her age could suggest and had an incredibly varied repertoire of magic, 99 types was far below her actual ability.

“Binding-Type Activation Sequence… I want to increase the types of Anti-Personnel Combat Magics.”

“Hm? You already have Speed Magics, so do you need to add Binding-Types?”

Of all the different types of magic, Miyuki specialized in Speed-Type Magics. One division of Speed-Type Magic was Freezing Magic, capable of reducing a target’s temperature to near absolute zero.

“Onii-sama should know that Speed Magic is rarely directed towards individual use and very difficult to work with. Partial speed reduction or partial freezing are practically impossible, and the Invocation time is very long. I thought of this after watching today’s match. I’m lacking in magics that use speed as the primary focus, with the intent on using the minimal force to subdue the opponent.”

“Hm… But I don’t think Miyuki fits that type. Attacking before the opponent is ready and using speed to disrupt the opponent is a legitimate strategy. However, striking with force born of absolute superiority, using Zone Interference to nullify the incoming magic, then using magic that is both stronger and greater in scale than the opponent’s defensive capability, don’t you think that orthodox style fits you better?”

Zone Interference involved using the user’s own Magic Power to nullify opposing magics within the user’s immediate surroundings. This occurs when a zone has been saturated with a user’s magic, rendering the zone “Unable to be Changed”, thus overriding the opponent’s magic attempt to rewrite the surroundings.

Just as Tatsuya said, Miyuki’s Zone Interference was incredibly powerful. Even in magical combat, it was unlikely she would be harmed in any way. Usually, whoever seizes the initiative has the advantage. This is a fundamental strategy in magical combat, but when up against an opponent like Miyuki, the advantage of seizing the initiative would be greatly decreased.

“…I can’t do it?”

Then again, in the face of his sister’s submissive question, Tatsuya didn’t say “no”.

“No, that’s not the case. That’s true… In the Student Council, if it’s up against a fellow student, then this strategy would be necessary. I understand. Under the premise of not reducing the current magic, I’ll readjust the systems of the Activation Sequence.”

Now that his sister expressed her request, Tatsuya did not refuse. However, he did not forget his earlier suggestion.

“You’re not going to consider getting another CAD?”

“Only Onii-sama can dual wield two CADs.”

“If you put your mind to it, you can do it too.”

Tatsuya forced a smile as he ran his hand over Miyuki’s head as she stared at him. Gently rubbing her hair or head was one of Tatsuya’s basic methods for improving his sister’s mood.

The effect was immediate.

Miyuki closed her eyes in pleasure as her small head was completely immersed in her brother’s tender care.

“Let’s start with a quick examination.”

Seeing that Miyuki’s pleasant mood had returned, Tatsuya adopted a specialist’s expression.





Reluctantly leaving her brother’s touch, Miyuki stepped back and removed her robe.

What was revealed before Tatsuya’s eyes was an indecently dressed body.

As she lay on the examination bed, Miyuki was only covered by her white underclothes.

Tidy and pure white, it seemed to turn the situation even more sensual.

Even though they are kin — no, against Miyuki’s breathtaking beauty, no one should’ve been able to keep their composure. Miyuki’s stance exuded enough charm to drive men mad.

His sister’s eyes could not hide her sense of shame, but even under such a gaze Tatsuya remained stolid, not revealing a single emotional expression.

Right now, he was a machine. An observing, analyzing, recording machine wrapped in flesh.

Completely unaffected by emotion, objectively analyzing the situation; an ideal state Magicians strove to reach thus manifested upon Tatsuya’s body.




“Good work, it’s done.”

Hearing Tatsuya’s words, Miyuki left the bed and stood up.

This type of examination could not be obtained anywhere.

In fact, it is extremely rare to see this sort of intensely detailed maintenance.

The maintenance facilities on campus simply involved putting on a pair of headphones and placing your hands on the touch pad for examination.

Tatsuya kept his eyes averted to the side while handing the velvet robe back to Miyuki, who wore a glum expression while gazing at Tatsuya’s back.

Her elder brother sat in a chair with a backrest that only reached the upper waist and, as if nothing had happened, gazed at the terminal.

No, it was not “as if”.

Actually, it was expected that nothing would happen, since this was a weekly occurring process.

This would go on without end if they were consciously aware of each individual occurrence.

Even though her embarrassment had not disappeared, and she was acutely aware that this sense of shame was something that shouldn’t be lost, she didn’t have any thoughts towards taking the next step.

She forced herself not to think of the next step.

If her elder brother could keep his composure, this was also something that Miyuki could be happy about.

—If only it was as usual.

“Onii-sama is quite crafty…”

“Miyuki?”

Hearing Miyuki’s tender and beautiful voice, Tatsuya quickly responded.

—It was very rare to hear Onii-sama use that kind of wavering, harried voice.

—Upon hearing that, the one whose heartbeat became erratic, whose temperature rose, and whose heart fairly sang in pleasure was none other than herself.

With the velvet robe draped over her shoulders and not closed in the front, Miyuki pressed her soft chest onto Tatsuya’s back, gently rubbing her face against Tatsuya’s cheek, and continued to whisper softly into her elder brother’s ear.

“Miyuki was so embarrassed, but Onii-sama was just like always, completely expressionless…”

“Uh, Miyuki, I say?”

“Or, do you not see me as someone of the opposite sex?”

“If I did see you that way, then we’d be in serious trouble!”

That was true. At that moment, just as these words were about to become the topic of conversation, her subconscious formed a chain that forcibly dragged back this line of thought.

“Is Onii-sama not interested in Miyuki? Is Onii-sama more interested in Saegusa-senpai’s type? Or, maybe someone like Watanabe-senpai? Earlier today, your conversation seemed very affectionate…”

“You heard that?”

Seemed extremely unlikely.

Miyuki should’ve been in the Student Council Room being tutored by Azusa in regards to using the computer system.

On top of that, even if someone was eavesdropping, there was no way Tatsuya could not have detected them.

However, Tatsuya did not have the time right now to marshal these thoughts into arguments.

“Aha, just as expected! Both of them are beauties!”

“I say, Miyuki? Aren’t you misunderstanding something?”

“Onii-sama is being pulled between two beautiful senpais on either side.”

All of a sudden, Miyuki’s CAD was held in her left hand.

“This is your punishment!”

“Ah!”

Unexpectedly, it was not magic, but a Psion Surge released by Miyuki that caused Tatsuya’s body to spasm and fall out of the chair.

[Self Restoration, Auto Start.]

[Core Eidos Data, Read from Backup.]

[Load Magic Sequence — Complete. Self Restoration — Complete.]

The instance of losing consciousness did not last a single second.

He had never lost consciousness longer than that instance.

His physical body did not allow him to collapse for any duration longer than that time.

This was his personal magic, his curse.

As he opened his eyes naturally, what he saw was a beautiful visage staring down at him.

“Onii-sama, good morning.”

“…Did I, do something to incur your displeasure?”

“My apologies, I went overboard with my joke.”

Though her voice was apologetic, Miyuki’s face was smiling once more.

That smile was capable of disarming even the sternest adult’s attitude, a cute smile matching her age that Miyuki rarely wore.

Watching that smiling face, not even he could do anything, Tatsuya thought.

In reality, wasn’t this exactly like a pair of innocent siblings playing around?

At the end of the day, his sister was incapable of actually doing something that could cause him harm.

“Please, take it easy on me…”

Grasping his sister’s hand, Tatsuya mumbled this as he too smiled.




She awoke at the normal time.

But in comparison to usually getting out of bed, her mood was worse.

Maybe her brain was still muddled by sleep.

The house didn’t have her elder brother’s presence.

He had probably left for morning training.

This happened every day.

Her elder brother, who always went to sleep later than she did, but always woke before she did.

Like yesterday, it was very rare for her to get up first.

In the past, she had been worried that her elder brother was going to ruin his body.

Now she understood that such worries were meaningless.

Her elder brother…that person was special.

The people of the world call her a genius.

That was the praise that they gave to special individuals, people that were different from themselves.

—In fact, they understood nothing at all.

The truly impressive, special, bona fide genius, should be her elder brother.

That person existed in a different dimension.

They could not even comprehend that.

Those that hide their personal jealousy to flatter others…they probably couldn’t understand.

True talent that towers over lesser mortals, that draws a terror that transcends jealousy.

Not awe, but terror.

The man who by all rights would be the father of these two siblings crumpled before that terror. And in the face of that terror, he belittled and abused his own son. All this she was aware of.

Her elder brother believed that she remained ignorant.

Thus, she pretended not to know.

Father — that man to this day still sought to belittle her elder brother’s talent, to give him a false sense of defeatism, seeking to pinion the wings of his spirit and ambition. All this she knew.

How comical.

He originally sought to imprison her elder brother, only to find himself crushed by the fact that his son’s talent far exceeded his own.

That son obtained the “resources” he needed to barter for his freedom.

Their father could only watch that one last binding, and was forced to let go.

The only thing that man could do was adopt that phony title, and collect the hollow praises of the masses.

That person was not interested in this, she probably knew this as well.

…She was unable to control her own thoughts.

It was as if she wasn’t herself and were someone else instead while thinking this.

Probably not fully conscious, Miyuki thought.

Must be a lack of sleep.

The cause was extremely obvious.

It was the reason behind why she had acted the way she had yesterday.

That moment had been perfectly peaceful.

It was rare to see her elder brother so harried; the sight was both comical and cute.

Her mood had been very pleasant.

However, once separated from her elder brother and lying alone in bed, that sense of peace had disappeared.

Her chest throbbed and she couldn’t sleep.

Uneasiness pervaded; sleep remained elusive.

This must be love.

But,

That can’t be the passion of romantic love.

And it couldn’t be the affection of romantic love.

Because that person was her elder brother. Her elder brother by blood. From that moment 3 years ago, when she first heard of their relation.

Since being saved by that person and knowing the truth that day 3 years ago, I have worked hard towards being a worthy little sister to that person.

I’ve always had this dream, that one day I would be able to help that person, just as he helped me. I want to become the one that that person can depend upon. This was how I rationalized it.

From that person, I demand nothing.

Because this life that should have faded away into oblivion, was saved by that person.

Even though right now I am only the shackles that bind that person in place.

But one day, I want to be the key that liberates him.

I want to be the person who can be of help to him.

—The first thing is to prepare breakfast.

While he could probably eat over there,

Onii-sama would probably obediently return home on an empty stomach.

To let Onii-sama eat a delicious breakfast: that is what I can do right now.

Miyuki smoothly rose, and stretched herself out.





Chapter 5




There are many special things in the High School Magic Division, but the basic system is no different from normal schools.

Here in the First High School, there are club activities.

Like normal schools, to become an official club, you need to have a minimum amount of people and have some kind of track record.

But, since this school has a close relationship with magic, there are some clubs that can only exist in a Magic High School.

Within major magical games, schools One through Nine within the Magical Academy often get together and have competitions. The outcomes of these competitions often rank these various schools. Depending on the schools, they may put more emphasis towards these games than most prestigious sports schools. If a club were able to perform highly within the “Nine Schools Competition”, then the club’s budget and its members receive special treatment.

Finding and getting talented new students has become the most important task every year since it affects the influence the clubs have on campus, and this task has full support from the school. That’s why during this season, the clubs battle ferociously in order to gain as many new students as possible.

“…And this is why all kinds of trouble appears every year.”

In the Student Council Room.

Thoroughly tasting Miyuki’s hand-made bento, Tatsuya listened to Mari’s explanation.

“The solicitations from the clubs are so fierce, it often affects the classes. And it doesn’t help that there’s only a 1 week time limit for them to get as many new students as they can,”

Mayumi, who was sitting next to Mari, explained.

Nestled close to Tatsuya was Miyuki herself, as if she belonged there.

Suzune and Azusa were not there. They only came to the room yesterday because Mayumi invited them; usually they had lunch with their classmates.

Mari, like yesterday, had her own home-made lunch. Mayumi was slightly angry because she was the only one eating the dining server’s machine-made lunch, but her mood seemed to finally recover. She even exclaimed that she would start making her lunch tomorrow.

“During this time, various clubs are bringing out the tents all at once. It’s like a small festival going on here. There are even secret lists that name all the students who scored high grades on the entrance exams, and I’m sure those people will be heavily targeted. Obviously, there are rules in place that penalize the clubs and its members if they break them, but it’s not uncommon to see fist fights or even magic shooting about.”

Tatsuya put on a surprised face after listening to Mari’s explanation.

“I thought carrying around CADs is prohibited?”

It is possible to still use magic without a CAD, but something like “shooting about” magic definitely requires a CAD for most people.

Mari’s answer amazed Tatsuya.

“The school gives them permission so that they can have ‘demonstrations’. There is a simple screening in place, but it’s more or less a free pass. Because of that, during this time, this place becomes a giant lawless zone full of chaos.”

Well obviously, thought Tatsuya. Why would the school allow such a thing…? Usually they would make a screening like this more strict.

Before Tatsuya could formulate the question, Mayumi gave the answer.

“I believe it’s mainly because the school wants the clubs to score highly in the Nine Schools Competition. I’m sure the school wouldn’t mind a few rules being broken as long as they raise the chances of recruiting more students.”

The government outlawed mandatory participation in extra-curricular activities over 10 years ago because it neglected students’ rights. Because of that, the school cannot do anything openly besides letting the various clubs recruit as they want.

“Well, that’s the situation we’re in. Starting today, the Disciplinary Committee is going all out. Whew, I’m glad we were able to cover all of our empty seats.”

As she said that, she sent a sarcastic look to her side.

“I’m glad you were able to find someone so talented, Mari.”

Seeing how she ignored the look with a smile, it looked like they do this sort of thing often.

After eating the last bite and putting the chopsticks down, his cup was being filled with hot tea from beside him.

After taking a few sips, Tatsuya attempted to put up a small resistance.

“Well, the clubs are targeting the students with the highest grades, meaning the First Course students correct? I don’t think I would be of any use in that case.”

Only Course 2 students should police Course 2 students. He was using Mari’s argument from yesterday against her.

“Who cares about that. I’m counting on you.”

She completely blew it off.

There was no way Tatsuya was able to respond to this.

“…*Sigh*, understood. I assume we are starting after school?”

“Right after you’re done with class, just come to HQ.”

“Understood.”

Tatsuya quietly accepted Mari’s words. It was hard to tell if his actions were manly or he just plainly gave up.

Sitting beside him, Miyuki asked, “President, are we going to join in the patrol as well?”

Miyuki referred to “we” as in the Student Council members. Tatsuya smiled, seeing how his beloved sister was able to fit in so quickly even though she could be difficult around people.

“I will be assigning A-chan as support. Hanzo-kun and I have to standby in HQ, so you and Rin-chan will have to stay here.”

“Understood.”

Miyuki nodded her head meekly, but Tatsuya could see that she was slightly upset. She may not have been combative but her skills were high. She probably just wanted to test out the new restraint-type magics that were added in her activation sequence.

But, when he told her that she yelled “No, that’s not it!” and quietly added “Stupid Onii-sama”, which may sound like a curse depending on how you listen to it. Then Tatsuya wondered,

“Nakajou-senpai is on support?”

It was a subtle claim that suggested that Azusa may be unreliable for the job.

Only a “subtle” one though.

“I know you’re uneasy about her based on her appearance, but you should know Tatsuya, appearances can be deceiving.”

“I understand that, but…”

Tatsuya was mainly pointing out to her timid attitude.

Mayumi understood what Tatsuya was trying to say and laughed.

“Well, the timidity CAN be a little bad at times, but don’t worry. A-chan’s magic will come in handy in these situations.”

She let out a smirk similar to Mari’s.

“You see. At times like these when you may have large crowds going wild, her magic — Azusayumi[8] — can really be effective.”

Modern magic is a technology where most of the magic is formulated and shared. Of course, there are some private magics that are not known to the public, but most are registered in a database. Most of the magics are only categorized by “type” and “effect”, but some magics that have high originality are often given inherent names.

“Azusayumi? I don’t believe there is an official inherent name such as that. Is it an External Systematic Magic?”

Tatsuya thought about it, but then concluded that there is no registered magic that goes by the name of “Azusayumi”. He only asked about External Systematic Magic because most unregistered magic was usually External Systematic Magic.

“…Don’t tell me you memorized every single inherent name.”

Rather than answering his question, Mari let out an amazed voice.

“…Tatsuya-kun, you must have like a satellite connection that constantly links you to a massive database or something,”

Mayumi answered while widening her eyes.

Miyuki was about to burst out with laughter, but this wasn’t the first time that people asked this kind of question, so she was able to maintain her humble composure.

Modern Magic was based on studies on super natural powers. Rather than categorizing magic by its visual aspects, like “the flame is burning” or “the wind is blowing”, they categorize them by its effects.

“Speed, Weight”, “Movement, Vibration”, “Converge, Dissipate”, and “Absorb, Disperse” are known as the 4 System/8 Type magic. Granted, there are some exemptions to this category. Magic that is not a part of the 4 System/8 Type magic is broken down into 3 categories. One is perception-type magic known as “ESP” (Extra Sensory Perception, not Extra Special Power). Another is a magic that does not aim to alter phenomena by temporarily rewriting the body of information associated with phenomena, “Eidos”, but aims to control the Psion itself. This is known as Non-Systematic Magic.

Mayumi’s specialized Particle Release Magic is a typical Non-Systematic Magic. The magic Tatsuya used to KO Hattori is also more along the lines of Non-Systematic Magic (rather than Vibration Magic), but since Psion manipulation is technically a part of the 4 System/8 Type, the difference between the two is trivial.

And the third type isn’t something that manipulates physical objects, but the spirits themselves. These types of magic are just referred to as the External Systematic Magic since they don’t belong to any type of system. Some examples of magic in these characters include magic that manipulate spiritual beings, mind reading, spirit separations, and even mind control.

“As Tatsuya may have figured out, A-chan’s ‘Azusayumi’ is an Informational Manipulative External Systematic Magic. In any given area, she can put multiple people under a trance-like state and guide them however she wants.”

After being surprised multiple times, Mayumi finally gave the answer to what “Azusayumi” is.

The “Informational Manipulative External Systematic Magic” is a type of mental interference magic that controls not only your thoughts, but your feelings as well.

“Azusayumi isn’t something that robs or overtakes your consciousness, so it doesn’t make the opponent completely helpless. Instead, rather than only affecting an individual, it affects a group of people. So it’s the perfect type of magic to calm down a wild crowd should they go out of hand.”

After hearing Mari’s additional explanation, Tatsuya put on a serious expression.

“…Aren’t there first-class restrictions tied to that kind of magic though?”

The External Systematic Magics have many specialized effects, so there are strict limits imposed on them, more so than the typical 4 System/8 Type magic. Out of them, the restrictions are harshest on the Mental Interference Magics. As explained, this type of magic can become a fearsome brain-washing tool. People in a hypnotic state are extremely vulnerable to commands. If this type of magic’s existence were known, tyrannical governments, terrorists, cults, and the like would surely do anything to get their hands on it. But when Tatsuya pointed that out, Mayumi answered “There’s nothing to worry about” as she chuckled.

“Do you think A-chan is the type to cooperate with some dictator?”

“Well, there are cases where she could be forced to cooperate.”

“No way. She gets teary-eyed just by finding a small amount of money on the ground. I don’t think she’ll be able to concentrate on the magic with all that sense of guilt crushing her.”

It’s common knowledge that your mental state affects your magic. If she was that kind-hearted, then the mere thought of an awful crime like mass brain-washing could make her unable to use any magic. Well, another way to look at it is, if she was that weak-hearted, then someone could just make her dependent on them and manipulate her that way, but there was no reason to go down that route at the moment. Right now, there was an even more basic problem.

“I’m sure that the laws concerning the restriction of Mental Interference Magic are valid no matter what kind of person Nakajou-senpai is…”

After Miyuki pointed that out, Mayumi seemed to be at a loss of words.

“…Um, don’t worry Miyuki-san. It’s not like she uses it outside of school.”

The uneasy answer that she gave out was absurd. She didn’t seem like the type who showed their weakness when they were cornered, but if it weren’t for Mari’s help she would’ve just dug herself into a deeper hole.

“Mayumi… saying it like that would make people misunderstand. Nakajou was granted permission to use her External Systematic Magic only within the school grounds. Well, we did use a backdoor method that’s often used by the Research Institutions by giving the reason for the exception as, ‘scientifically researching the easement of usage restrictions’.”

“I see.”

“I didn’t know you could do it like that.”

“Yes, you can…”

The Shiba siblings nodded with understanding at Mari’s explanations while Mayumi let out a nervous laugh.




As Tatsuya was heading towards the Disciplinary Committee HQ after class, a high pitched voice called to him.

When he turned around, a skinny girl with short cut hair greeted him.

“I’m surprised Erika… are you by yourself?”

“Is that something to be surprised about? I don’t see myself keeping appointments with other people and going around with them.”

Now that she mentioned it, there were several instances Tatsuya could think of.

“Anyways Tatsuya-kun, what are you gonna do about clubs? Mizuki said she was going to join the Art Club. She invited me to join with her, but I’m not exactly the artistic type, so I am just walking around to see if there’s anything more fun to do.”

“Didn’t Leo also say that he chose something?”

“The Mountain Club right? That really suits him.”

“Well… it does seem to suit him.”

“The Mountain club at our school focuses more on survival than just climbing. Seriously, it’s almost like the club’s just made for him.”

The way she was subtly cursing about almost made her seem like she was bored.

“Hey Tatsuya, if you haven’t joined a club yet, do you wanna look around with me?”

Tatsuya wasn’t able to blatantly reject her because she seemed to have a lonely face, but if he pointed that out to her then she was sure to get angry at him.

“To tell you the truth, it seems like the Disciplinary Committee’s already using me as they please. It’s possible for me to walk around with you, but I have to do it as a patrol. If that’s okay with you then I can do it.”

“Hmmmmm… ah, well. Let’s just meet up in front of the classroom then.”

Erika seemed to think hard before letting out a shrug like she was reluctant to go along with it, but the smile on her face gave away her fake gestures.




“Why are you here?!”

That was how the reunion started.

“Aren’t you acting a bit rude?”

Tatsuya sighed and said that with a tired voice, but this caused only more agitation.

“What!!”

He seemed like he was about to lunge forward, but,

“Shut up you newcomer.”

A quick roar from Mari made Morisaki Shun stand upright and close his mouth.

“This is an official meeting for the Disciplinary Members, so every person here is a member of the Disciplinary Committee. At least get that through your head before you shout out like that.”

“I apologize!”

How pitiful; Morisaki’s face showed tension and fear. He was brought in only two days ago by Mari. Not only that, he was still feeling heat from being reprimanded from the Student President, a heavy burden for a serious new student such as him.

“Oh well, take a seat.”

Mari let out a nervous expression as she ordered the blood-drained faced first year to sit down. Judging from her demeanor, she did not seem like the type of person who would feel pleasure from oppressing those that were weaker than her.

Morisaki sat in the chair facing Tatsuya. It was an unwanted seating arrangement for the two, but they couldn’t help it because they were the newest members. Being an underling meant they had to sit at the edge of the table, glaring at each other.

“Everyone here?”

After 9 people entered the room, Mari stood up.

“Okay, listen up. The beginning of that crazy week is here again. For the Disciplinary Committee, this will be the first big hurdle we have to overcome in the beginning of the year. Last year, there were certain people in here who had joined and caused an uproar during this period, and there were others who tried to stop it but ended up making it worse. Please be sure to brace yourselves this year. I don’t want to give any reprimands to anyone. I repeat, Disciplinary members will not be the ones causing trouble this year.”

Multiple members just sat there and shrugged. Tatsuya, on the other hand, seemed to always get into some kind of trouble, so he swore to himself to be extra careful during this time.

“Thankfully, we were able to find replacements in time to cover the ones who graduated. I’ll introduce you. Stand up.”

Even though there weren’t any rehearsals or anything, the two were able to stand up quickly without being muddled. But, the two had completely opposite facial expressions.

Morisaki was unable to or didn’t even bother to hide his nervous facial expression, but the way he stood upright showed his enthusiasm. On the contrast, Tatsuya just stood up acting calm and composed.

“Morisaki Shun from 1A and Shiba Tatsuya from 1E. These two will be incorporated in the patrols from now on.”

There were murmurs in the room after hearing Tatsuya’s class number. But since it was the headquarters where they reprimanded any student using the offensive word, he didn’t hear anybody using the word “Weed”.

“Who is he being paired up with?”

Instead, there were some people who asked questions about him. One of the people who raised his hand was a 2nd Year named Okada. He was one of the people elected by the teachers.

“As I explained previously, during the club recruitment week, everybody will patrol the grounds on their own accord. The newcomers are not an exception to this.”

“Are they even useful?”

Formally, that question was pointed to both Tatsuya and Morisaki, but by the way his eyes looked at Tatsuya’s left chest showed that it was directed only towards him.

Something like this was expected to Tatsuya, so he just let Mari handle everything. But Mari, on the other hand, already had a fed up look on her face when she was looking at Okada.

“Don’t worry, they’re useful. I’ve seen Shiba’s skills with my own eyes and Morisaki is also pretty competent with his device manipulation. He just had bad luck with his opponent. If you’re still anxious, then why don’t you pair up with Morisaki?”

Mari let out a negligent answer like she had enough of it, but Okada hid his smirk and, while holding his composure, let out a sarcastic “It’s fine”.

“Anybody else want to say anything?”

Tatsuya was surprised at Mari’s belligerent composure because it made her seem like she was picking a fight with everyone. But besides Tatsuya and Morisaki, no one paid much attention to it. The other members treated this like it was a daily routine. There seemed to be some deep-rooted conflicts within the committee, but the leader here seemed to be the one stirring up these conflicts.

“We will be concluding this meeting. The patrols will be done according to plan. Does anyone have any objection with this?”

There were some who seemed like they wanted to say something, but they weren’t people who were actively opposed to the notion.

“Okay, very well then, carry on. Don’t forget your recorders. I will explain things to Shiba and Morisaki. Everyone else, mobilize!”

Everyone stood upright, put their heels together, and used their right fist to hit their left chest. Tatsuya wondered what was going on, but he learned later that this was the traditional salute that the Disciplinary Committee used. There were other rules like saying “Good morning”, no matter what the time was, and such.

The other six members started leaving the room one by one. Koutarou and Sawaki, the last ones to leave, said “Don’t try too hard” and “If you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask me” as they left (it was obvious which one said what). As Tatsuya was being courteous (at least formally) to the two, Morisaki glared at him with annoyance. Mari saw this and held in a sigh while feeling a headache coming around.

“First, I’ll give you guys these.”

Mari gave the two an armband and a small video recorder.

“Put the recorder in your chest pocket. It’s customized where the lens would pop right out of the pocket. All you have to do is push the recording button on the right.”

When they put the recorders in their pockets as told, the lens stuck out, ready to record.

“Be sure to keep that recorder on you at all times. When you see someone committing a violation, be sure to press the switch. You don’t really have to worry about getting a good picture because testimony from a Disciplinary Member is considered as adequate evidence. Just think of it as a precautionary measure.”

As she waited for the two to reply, Mari ordered them to bring out their mobile terminals.

“I’m going to send you the communication frequencies now… confirm that you received it.”

The two confirmed the receipt of the communication frequency.

“Always report your findings using this frequency. We will also be giving out instructions through this frequency as well. Lastly, CADs. Disciplinary Members are permitted to carry their CADs and you don’t have to wait for permission from someone to use them. But, if we find any unauthorized usage, you will be kicked out of the committee and receive a penalty more severe than the normal students. Last year, we had a student expelled because of that, so be careful.”

“Question.”

“Go ahead.”

“May I use the CADs that I found in the Committee room?”

Tatsuya’s question caught her off-guard so it took a moment for an answer to come.

“…I don’t mind, but why? Those are pretty old models.”

Mari figured, by watching Tatsuya during his match yesterday and such, that he was skilled with handling and maintaining CADs. Not to mention that Azusa was enthusiastically talking about the high spec CAD that he used.

And here he was asking to use an older model. Mari couldn’t hide her curiosity.

“They may be older models, but those CADs are high-class items mainly used by professionals.”

He gave an unexpected answer with a bitter smile.

“…Is that right?”

“Yes, that series has a low popularity because it’s such a hassle to maintain, but despite that, you are able to customize it however you want, and the switch while using the NCT is very sensitive. Thanks to that, although limited, it has passionate support from enthusiasts. The person who bought these was probably a fan of the series. The battery life is a little limited, but it’s been overclocked to boost processing power. If you sell these, you can probably get a hefty sum of money from those enthusiasts.”

“…And we’ve been treating those things as trash all this time. I see, now I know why you were so particular about cleaning up the place.”

“I’m sure if you brought Nakajou-senpai over she would have explained about the series…”

“Nakajou is too afraid to even step foot in this room.”

“Oh… I see.”

The two let out nervous laughs. But Mari soon noticed Morisaki was thrown out of the loop.

“*Cough* Well, in that case use it however you want. It’s just collecting dust in the room anyway.”

“Understood. In that case, I’ll borrow two of them.”

“Two? You really are an interesting person.”

Tatsuya took the two that he had secretly customized for himself and attached them to both of his arms. Seeing that, Mari let out a smile, and Morisaki twisted his lips sarcastically.




“Hey.”

While leaving the HQ, Tatsuya was called out by Morisaki.

He could tell by his voice that it wasn’t something friendly.

Tatsuya thought about ignoring him, but that would just make things more complicated, so he unwillingly turned around.

“What?”

A resenting voice and an arrogant answer. There was no way a friendly atmosphere would come out of this.

“You seem to be good at bluffing. Is that how you got to the president and the other members’ good side?”

“Are you jealous?”

“Wha…”

If you’re going to get angry over a small counter like this then stop making sarcastic remarks, thought Tatsuya.

But at the same time, he felt a little jealous of Morisaki’s straightforward attitude.

“…Either way, you really crossed the line this time. There’s no way you Course 2 guys can use multiple CADs at once.”

By not saying “Weeds”, he’s probably putting his awareness in the Disciplinary Member’s role, thought Tatsuya cynically. But Morisaki didn’t notice Tatsuya’s bored stares and continued with his lecturing like he was drunk with his own words.

“If you attach CADs on both your arms, then the Psion interference would make both of them unusable. You didn’t even know that did you? All you were thinking about was looking cool. Since you can’t use any decent spells, I guess you have to do these sneaky little things to get by just so you don’t look stupid.”

“Is that supposed to be advice? You seem pretty confident, Morisaki.”

“Ha! I’m different from you people. I was caught off guard the other day, but that won’t happen next time. I’ll show you the difference in our levels.”

How naïve of him to assume that there will always be a “next time”…




Even though he had a meeting with Erika, she wasn’t in front of the classroom when Tatsuya came.

Oh well…

Tatsuya let out a sigh, a habit he acquired since the beginning of school, and brought up the LPS in his mobile terminal.

There was a red dot slowly moving on the school map. At least she was kind enough to not turn off her mobile device. She didn’t seem that far away.

It was only supposed to be a precautionary measure though…

She was completely relying on him to seek her out. He zoomed in on her location and started walking towards it.

Tents covered one school ground to another; it almost made this place look like a fair with street vendors.

“Seems like there’s a festival going on here…”

Erika said to herself. But when she realized that, she started laughing at herself.

She had a habit of talking to herself, but from the beginning of this school year, she hid that habit.

Unusual that I’m by myself, huh… It looks like you really don’t understand me that well Tatsuya-kun.

She was silently talking to him — the boy whom she broke her promise with.

During middle school, actually even in elementary school, she spent most of her time alone. It’s not like she hated people or anything like that. She had a pleasant attitude and she could easily get along with anyone. She just becomes negligent towards relationships quickly.

She just couldn’t be with anyone 24 hours a day. Her good friends called her cold and said that she acted like a whimsical cat. Others said that she acted high and mighty. There were many boys who wanted to have a relationship with her, but none ever lasted. She went around freely, not being tied down by any promises.

That was her motto.

…Well, it WAS my motto… but lately I’ve been acting a bit weird.

Looking at it from a 3rd person’s perspective, it almost seemed like she was stalking him, Erika thought to herself. This is the first time that I promised to meet up and go around with someone. It has only been a week so I could get bored of this like always, but at the same time, I was thinking that this might be different.

“Erika~”

10 minutes after the promised time. From just past the school entrance within school grounds, Tatsuya was calling out Erika’s name.

He found me quicker than I expected, she thought.

“…Sorry.”

He showed a painful expression on his face for a moment, but then he bowed his head down.

“…So you’re going to apologize.”

Erika wasn’t expecting this, so she was stupefied.

“I’m sorry for being 10 minutes late for our meeting time. But, being late and not being at the promised location are two different things.”

“Ack… sorry.”

It was a strange expression, but Erika was unable to counter the smile on his serious face.

“…Say Tatsuya, don’t people say that you have a bad personality?”

“No, that’s unthinkable. No one has ever complained about my personality. They have said that I am a bad person though.”

“That’s the same thing! Wait, that’s even worse!”

“Oh wait, that’s wrong. Not a bad person but an evil person.”

“That’s even worse!”

“I was even called a demon by some people.”

“Ok, I’ve had enough!”

As Erika was panting, Tatsuya started acting like a pondering philosopher.

“You seem tired. Are you okay?”

“…Tatsuya. People mentioned that you have a bad personality, didn’t they?”

“Well as a matter of fact they did.”

“…So you’re just going to ignore the entire conversation we just had?”

Erika just drooped her head from fatigue.




It took a little effort recovering her mood, but Tatsuya was able to continue his patrol before people around them started ridiculing them.

But 5 minutes into it, Tatsuya wanted to go home.

He had underestimated things. Even though he heard that things were a bit “rowdy”, he still thought it would be within the bounds of a normal high school club recruitment fair. But in reality, it was nowhere near that.

Hm, I see why they need people to police this place, but I don’t think even 10 people are going to be enough.

The mass of tents covering the grounds were filled with people. Across the wall of people, Erika was captured and letting out some kind of scream. Even though she had high agility, she still wasn’t able to push her way through the crowd. Well, it didn’t sound too convincing coming from Tatsuya who decided to look on from a distance.

It did not necessarily mean that Tatsuya had more agility; it was just that people targeted her rather than him. Tatsuya had an average height and looks, and at first glance he seemed a bit plain. On top of that, he was also a Weed so people paid no attention to him.

In Erika’s case, she was beautiful. Miyuki is the type of fragile beauty that made people hesitate reaching their hand out to, but Erika is the type of beauty that, even though people know they would be burned somewhat, they would still try to grasp her.

Basically, what happened was that the club solicitations bombarded her. The fact that she was a Course 2 student didn’t help her at all (or as Erika put it, it was useless). They were probably trying to make her join as a mascot figure, something that didn’t require the use of magic. So everything around her turned into chaos.

Tatsuya couldn’t see what was going on through the line of people (he guessed that they were probably, at worst, only grabbing her arm, holding on to her, or even groping her). The atmosphere quickly turned murderous as this went on to a point where Tatsuya could no longer ignore it.

Tatsuya only went ahead of her because he assumed that she would be able to fight her way through. A person would need a lot of training to restrain someone like Erika. He remembered how she was able to quickly flick the CAD out of Morisaki’s hands, and that move was not something that could be obtained in a year or so. Because of that, Tatsuya had confidence in her abilities.

The ones who actually surrounded Erika were all female upperclassmen. It seemed like the males were not insolent enough to go around touching a girl’s body. He assumed that she would be able to break past girls who were only a year older than her, but that seemed to put her at a disadvantage. Erika was hesitant in using any violence.

Just when Tatsuya thought about saving her, it occurred.

“Hey, wait, where are you touching me? S… Stop…!”

He started hearing cries of help from Erika. It looked like playtime was over.

Tatsuya quickly engaged the CAD on his left arm. When the magic formulated, he kicked the ground and made it shake slightly. Physically, the vibrations he made from the shock weren’t visible, but he used magic to manipulate the vibrations he made and directed them towards the crowd.

The vibrations weren’t enough to make a person unconscious. Tatsuya didn’t have the physical strength or the magic capability to make a vibration that large. But the vibrations did make everyone lose their sense of balance.

As he pushed forward in the crowd everyone who was touched by Tatsuya fell over. After pushing a number of people over, both boys and girls, he was able to get to the center and break through the upperclassmen. Tatsuya then grabbed Erika’s hand and said “Run”. He pulled her hand and made his way out of the crowd.

After slipping through the crowd like a magician, Tatsuya was able to run to a remote location between the buildings. After letting go of her hand and turning around, he finally realized the mess she was in. Her hair was messed up, her new uniform was wrinkled, her top was undone, and her necktie was in her hand since it had fallen off.

Tatsuya, by pure coincidence, was able to see the skin underneath her uniform as she frantically tried to fix herself.

“Don’t look!”

Even though she was looking down, she was able to tell by the way Tatsuya’s feet were turning towards her. When she got back up to yell at him, his face was already turned the other direction.

“…Did you see?”

He could easily imagine her red face.

“…”

But Tatsuya was unable to give her an answer.

He should say that he didn’t see. That would be the smart thing to do.

But the slightly sunburned skin, her white breast, and her slim body. Even the beige-colored undergarments were all etched in his memory.

“Did. You. See?!”

It seemed like she was done dressing since he could no longer hear any rustling of clothes. At the same time, he understood that he didn’t have any more time to think based on the tone of her voice.

Well, in that case I should be punched in the face then, he thought. Even though it wasn’t his fault, he should at least show some sincerity being the guy and all.

—And so, after briefly escaping from reality, he turned around (now that he thought about it, he was not completely innocent since he left her in the crowd in the first place).

Thankfully she was actually done dressing up. If she wasn’t, then it would’ve probably made things much worse.

Tatsuya was relieved in seeing her fully buttoned up with the neck tie woven tightly. But then Tatsuya thought, if she hadn’t loosened her neck tie and unbuttoned the top button in the first place, it wouldn’t have gotten so bad.

“Sorry, I saw.”

But he did not dare say that. After seeing her red face and lines of tears that were left on her eyes, he couldn’t say anything.

Erika glared at Tatsuya from below. She started becoming red again and clenched her fists, probably from remembering the shame she just suffered.

“…Idiot!”

She didn’t use her hands, but instead kicked him in the shin. But then, after she did that, she quickly turned around and walked away.

Tatsuya silently followed her.

Tatsuya couldn’t see her face, but he could tell it was filled with tears.

He trained his shin so it could withstand a full-blown attack from a wooden sword.

Her flexible shoes with no protection to the toes probably felt much more pain than he did. But, if he tried to say anything regarding that, she would probably just lash out again.

All he could do was pretend not to notice the unnatural way she walked.




Even though tents were popped up all over school, it was only on the school grounds outside. Inside the buildings, there were demonstrations going on within the various club rooms.

And also here in the gymnasium.

The two made their way into the 2nd gymnasium, also known as the “Arena”, where the Kendo club was performing.

—By the way, at this point Erika had long cooled her head. She already knew that she was blaming him for something that he didn’t do. It also helped that he didn’t make any excuses toward her. Yet, she already started unbuttoning her top button and loosened her neck tie because “it was getting hot”. She seemed to already be forgetting what she had gone through.

The two looked down on the arena by the corridor at the Kendo club’s demonstrations.

“Oh… even though it’s a Magic school, there’s a Kendo club.”

Erika nonchalantly said.

“Isn’t it common to have a Kendo club at a school?”

Tatsuya nonchalantly answered. But then Erika started staring at his face.

“…Is there something wrong?”

“…That’s unexpected.”

“What is?”

“I didn’t know that there was something Tatsuya-kun didn’t know. Anybody who’s had martial arts training already knows about this.”

Tatsuya started to worry after listening to her.

“Do I look like a person who acts like he knows everything?”

“Ah, no, that’s not it. It’s just that you have that aura that you know everything.”

“Aura you say… I’m the same year as you remember? Oh well, putting that aside, why is having a Kendo club so special?”

“Oh, right, you’re the same year as me… when you put it that way it’s kind of strange… ahhhh, anyway, Kendo right? If you’re aiming to become a Magician, Kendo isn’t something you do at a high school level. What Magicians typically use are magical sword skills based off from ‘Kenjutsu’ and not ‘Kendo’. You probably take Kendo up to elementary school to get the fundamentals of Kenjutsu, but during middle school, those who want to become Magicians already go to Kenjutsu instead.”

“Is that right… I thought Kendo and Kenjutsu were the same thing.”

“Wow, that’s really unexpected.”

After hearing Tatsuya say that, she really was surprised.

“Even though you seem like you have so much martial arts experience… ah, I know!”

“What?”

Tatsuya was surprised by Erika’s sudden outburst.

Well, he wasn’t the only one who was surprised, but Erika just ignored all that and just kept on making faces like “I got it” and “Everything makes sense now”.

“Hey Tatsuya, you’re assuming that all martial arts are combined with magic right? Not only martial arts but fighting spirits and things like that. You assume that magic is used to supplement the body when it moves around right?”

“Isn’t it obvious? Muscle isn’t the only thing that makes the body move.”

From Tatsuya’s point of view, what Erika said was obvious to him, but Erika only seemed to nod with some kind of understanding.

“Well, for Tatsuya it may be obvious. But in normal competitions that’s not the case.”

“I see.”

It was a roundabout way of saying it, but Tatsuya was now aware how his common sense was slightly off from hers.

“Putting that aside, why don’t we just quietly watch the performance now?”

This time it was Tatsuya’s turn to make Erika aware. When she followed his subtle glances, she saw that everybody was looking towards her. After letting out a nervous laugh, she became a quiet spectator.

The practice rounds shown by the regulars were in full force. What caught everyone’s eyes especially was the performance by a female 2nd Year student.

She wasn’t large or anything; she had around the same body structure as Erika, but she was fighting on par with a man twice her size.

It wasn’t just strength, but she was using graceful skills to parry her opponent’s attacks. She looked like she had some leeway.

She had a certain beauty in the way she fought the practice rounds. All the spectators had their eyes on her.

But there was an exception right here. Right after she defeated her opponent theatrically and bowed her head, Tatsuya heard a snort from beside him.

“It seems like you didn’t enjoy it.”

“Huh? Well, yeah…”

She didn’t realize that the statement was directed towards her so there was a slight pause in the answer.

“…It’s so boring watching this though. She’s fighting with an opponent that has a much lower skill level than her, so she’s able to show off like that. Instead of a fight, it seems more like a rehearsal.”

“Well, you are right regarding that, but…”

Tatsuya’s face let out a natural smile.

“It’s a performance to promote their club remember? There are always pro martial artists who do showy moves to demonstrate live combat, but you can’t really show live combat to normal people. Live combat in martial arts is basically trying to kill one another.”

“…You’re so cool-headed, aren’t you.”

“It’s just a difference of opinion.”

Erika looked away with an irritated face.

But this is the facial expression she uses when she acts like she’s angry. She’s probably more angry towards the people who use martial arts as a flashy show than what it’s really supposed to be and finds those people dishonest.

Even if Tatsuya puts those feelings into words, it would probably irritate her even further.

He doubted that she would just jump into the fight, but he knew that she would do something similar to that. As Tatsuya was about to lead Erika away, something caught his attention.

Just as the two were leaving the spectator corridor and about to exit the building, he started hearing a commotion. It seemed like someone was arguing.

When he looked to his side, Erika was looking up at him. Her eyes were brimming with curiosity.

The first one to dart off towards the commotion was Erika, while she grabbed Tatsuya’s sleeve.

Tatsuya was essentially being dragged to the middle of the commotion.

As the two pushed past the crowd (the only reason no one really got angry was because Erika smiled at them as she pushed on by), they saw a swordsman and a swordswoman confronting each other.

The girl was the same girl who just participated in the practice round (or rehearsal as Erika puts it). Her chest plate was still on, but her helmet was off. She was a beautiful girl with semi-long black hair. She seemed perfect as an advertisement for the new student recruits with her looks and her skill.

“Tatsuya, do you like those types of girls?”

“No, you’re much prettier Erika.”

“…I’m not going to fall for that monotone voice of yours.”

Even though she was glaring at him, her face was subtly red.

“Sorry, I’m not used to it.”

“…Aahhh! Why are you always…”

She started mumbling something but thankfully, she stopped harassing Tatsuya, so he was able to focus his attention on the swordsman.

He was about the same size as Tatsuya, but he seemed to have a spring-loaded body. He had a shinai[9] in his hand but no armor on. He was going to ask people around him what was going on, but it didn’t seem like he needed to.

“The Kenjutsu club is scheduled to perform an hour later Kirihara! Why can’t you wait?!”

“Wow, how can you say that Mibu? I was just trying to help you guys out since these weaklings you got here don’t seem to be advertising your Kendo club effectively.”

“By forcing him to have a practice round with you?! I can’t believe you’re saying things like that! If the Disciplinary Committee finds out that you used violence on an upperclassman, you’re not the only one who’s going to be in trouble!”

“Violence you say? Hey, hey Mibu, don’t be exaggerating things here. I just used my shinai to hit his helmet. If that guy’s part of the Kendo club, he shouldn’t be going unconscious over something like this. Besides, he was the one who started it anyway.”

“It’s because you provoked him!”

There isn’t much meaning to have a dispute when their weapons are pointed at each other, thought Tatsuya. But since it made clear what was going on, it was convenient for him.

“Seems like fun.”

Erika mumbled on the side, Tatsuya wasn’t sure if she was talking to herself or not. But he could tell from her tone that she was excited.

“This is much more interesting than that little rehearsal that we just saw.”

“Do you know those two?”

“Well, I don’t personally know them.”

Seeing how she responded to his question, it didn’t seem like she was talking to herself.

“I just remembered about the girl. Her name is Mibu Sayaka. The year before last, in the National Middle School Kendo Tournament, she placed second in the entire country. She was cheered by the media as the Beautiful Swordswomen for awhile.”

“…But she placed second, right?”

“Well… the champion’s looks were… you know.”

“I see.”

That’s the media for you.

“The guy’s name is Kirihara Takeaki. The year before last he placed 1st place in the Kanto Middle School Kenjutsu Tournament. A real champion.”

“He didn’t participate in the Nationals?”

“The Nationals for the Kenjutsu tournament only start from High school since there are much fewer competitors for that one.”

Well that’s right, nodded Tatsuya in agreement.

Kenjutsu is a sport that combined sword techniques with magic, so the basic prerequisite to do Kenjutsu is to be able to use magic. Even though technology has come a long way in assisting people in using magic, probably only 1 in 1000 middle schoolers are able to use it in a practical setting. Even in adulthood, only 1 in 10 are able to maintain that level of magic. Even though some of them are Course 2 students within the schools, outside of school, they’re basically elites.

“Oh, looks like it’s starting.”

Tatsuya was able to feel the atmosphere reaching its breaking point.

Just as a precautionary measure, he took out his armband and attached it to his left arm. The student next to him was surprised, but he glared at him after seeing there wasn’t anything on his left chest. But Tatsuya’s attention was focused on the two.

The female swordswoman was hesitant in attacking an opponent with no armor on. But, as long as they faced their swords at each other and had no intent on backing down, there was no choice but to fight.

It seemed like Kirihara was going to make the first move.

“Don’t worry Mibu, it’s only a demonstration for the Kendo club. I won’t use any magic on you.”

“Do you think you can beat me with technique alone? You, Kirihara from the Kenjutsu club who heavily relies on magic, and me, from the Kendo club who relies on nothing but technique?”





“You talk pretty big Mibu. I’ll show you. The Kenjutsu technique is used to fight past the body limitations!”

That was the signal of the fight.

Kirihara lunged forward and swung his shinai towards her head.

The sounds of shinais beating each other echoed in the room, followed by screams that came seconds later. The spectators couldn’t tell what was going on. They could only listen as bamboo and bamboo hit one another, sounds so violent that they almost sounded metallic. Most were only able to imagine the intense fighting taking place.

—Excluding a small number of people.

“Impressive. The female Kendo students are at a pretty high level. If this is how good the second place is, then how strong was the champion?”

Tatsuya let out a breadth of admiration towards Sayaka’s skill.

“No, she’s completely different from when I last saw her. I can’t believe how much she’s improved in only 2 years…”

Even though she let out a surprised look, Erika hid her face as she licked her lips while she let out a combative aura.

The two were momentarily locked in place, but they quickly pushed each other and jumped back to make space between one another.

Some took a breath while others gasped for it. The spectator’s reactions were split in two.

“I wonder who will win…”

Erika asked in a quiet voice.

“Mibu-senpai seems like she has the upper hand.”

Tatsuya answered in a whisper.

“The reason?”

“Kirihara-senpai is avoiding the head when he attacks. That first move he made was a bluff because he knew that she was easily going to take it. Besides, he’s limited by not being able to use his magic. In terms of technique alone, Mibu-senpai is much better.”

“Agreed. But, the question is, can Kirihara-senpai hold himself in until the end?”

“Oooooooooooooooo!”

First time during the match, Kirihara let out a roar while lunging forward and attacks from both opponents struck head on.

“Is it a draw?”

“No, it’s not.”

Kirihara’s shinai skimmed Sayaka’s left arm while Sayaka’s shinai was stuck in his right shoulder.

“Ugh.”

Kirihara used his left hand to push away her shinai and dove back.

“He lost because he tried to change his aim in the middle of the attack.”

“I see, so that’s why he seemed to waver in his attack. It was the perfect timing to make it a draw… but I guess he couldn’t cut off his feelings.”

Tatsuya and the others weren’t the only ones who knew the match was over.

Seated towards the front of the crowd were members of the Kendo club and the Kenjutsu club. The Kendo members let out a sigh of relief while the Kenjutsu members clenched their teeth in anger.

“If this were a real fight, then this would have been a mortal wound. The attack you made on me didn’t even reach my bones. Just admit your loss.”

Sayaka let out a declaration of victory in a graceful pose.

But Kirihara distorted his face while listening. Was his swordsman side admitting his loss despite what he was feeling otherwise?

“He…heheheheh.”

He suddenly started letting out a hollow laugh. Did he admit his defeat? It didn’t seem that way.

Tatsuya’s sense of danger shot up within him. The only person who sensed this more than Tatsuya was the one who was standing in front of Kirihara — Sayaka.

He recovered his stance, pointed his weapon at her, and looked sharply at her.

“A real fight, you say? If this was a real fight, you wouldn’t even be able to cut me. Mibu, do you really want to have a real fight? Then… I’ll show you what a ‘real fight’ is!”

As Kirihara activated his CAD using his right hand, screams came from the crowd of spectators.

There was a screeching sound that echoed the room, like someone was scratching a panel of glass. There were some who even kneeled down with pale faces.

Kirihara jumped forward and swung his shinai down.

He had the same speed, but he wasn’t using as much strength as before. Regardless, Sayaka jumped back.

The attack didn’t even hit; it barely grazed her. But her chestplate was cut open, just by getting grazed by a shinai.

The thing that increased its cutting power is a close combat Vibration Magic, “Sonic Blade”.

“How’s that Mibu?! This is a ‘real’ fight!”

As he was about to make another swing towards Sayaka, Tatsuya jumped in front of him.

Before he jumped in, Tatsuya activated his CADs on both arms (using his Psion as “hands” to press the switches) and transferred his Psion within them. He used those CAD to shoot out an intricate web of Psion waves, a type of Non-Systematic magic that he used.

By now, there were many spectators who held their mouths because a symptom similar to motion sickness spread across the crowd.

Kirihara’s shinai and Tatsuya’s arm intersected, but there weren’t any sounds of the shinai hitting meat.

The sound that came out was the sound of a body falling to the floor.

After the spectators recovered from the sound and sickness, they were able to finally see what was going on.

And what they saw was Kirihara on the ground while Tatsuya was keeping him there, by holding his left wrist and using his knee to push down on his shoulder.




Within the gymnasium, a.k.a “Arena”, what broke silence was whispers of hostility.

“Who’s that?”

“I’ve never seen him before.”

“Is he a new student?”

“Look at it, he’s a Weed.”

“What the hell is a Weed doing?”

“But that thing on his armband—”

“Wait, I heard a rumor that someone from the Course 2 made it into the Disciplinary Committee.”

“What? Seriously? A Weed in the Disciplinary Committee?”

The whispers originated from the Kenjutsu club and spread from there (from both boys and girls). Within the crowded circle, half stared at Tatsuya with hostility, while others simply gazed while holding their breath.

In this hostile atmosphere, Tatsuya coolly (while holding Kirihara down) took out his communication device in his mobile terminal. His cool face didn’t seem like a bluff. It seemed like he was used to being the bad guy in most situations.

“This is Tatsuya within the 2nd gymnasium. I have apprehended one student. He seems to be injured so please bring a stretcher just in case.”

He didn’t speak in a loud voice, but his voice echoed through the crowd.

After the realization of what was happening sunk in, a member of the Kenjutsu club took a step forward and started shouting at Tatsuya.

“Hey, what are you doing?!”

He must have been confused, asking meaningless questions like that. Actually, it might not have been a question, but more of a threat.

“I am apprehending Kirihara-senpai because of improper use of magic.”

Tatsuya dutifully answered the yelling individual. Well, technically, his eyes were still focused on Kirihara below him so even if it was dutiful it wasn’t exactly respectful. Depending on how you look at it, it seemed like he was looking down on his opponent.

And that’s exactly how the upperclassman Kenjutsu member took it.

“Hey, you! Stop looking down at me you damn Weed!”

He started lunging forward to grab Tatsuya in the chest.

Tatsuya quickly let go of Kirihara and stepped back. He took a look at Kirihara and saw that his consciousness was still hazy from the fall so it looked like he wasn’t going to be running away anywhere. After making that judgment, he focused his attention on the (oncoming) upperclassman in front of him.

Other Kenjutsu members were becoming angered by Tatsuya’s attitude of acting coolly like his opponents weren’t even a threat. The upperclassman facing him clenched his teeth to a point where you could hear it grind.

“Why is it only Kirihara?! Mibu over there is as guilty as he is! She was the one to continue the fight!”

The statement came from the crowd. It was a criticism that was shot toward Tatsuya and it was also made to support the upperclassman. But Tatsuya didn’t even budge and said,

“As I said before, I’m apprehending him for the improper use of magic.”

Again, with a calm voice he dutifully answered.

You should’ve just ignored them… thought Erika, and at that point, her concerns became real.

“Stop messing around!”

The upperclassman was filled with rage again and lunged toward Tatsuya.

Tatsuya avoided the attacks like a bullfighter in a ring, but this just made things worse.

Now the upperclassman was throwing his fists at him, but Tatsuya was still dodging those.

No matter what the upperclassman did he wasn’t able to touch Tatsuya. Not only was empty handed combat Tatsuya’s specialty, but the upperclassman was also making crude movements because of his rage.

Tatsuya was taking light steps to dodge his opponent’s brash punches. Just when Tatsuya stopped moving because the upperclassman stopped from fatigue, two more members from the Kenjutsu club attacked Tatsuya from behind.

Just when Erika was about to shout “Behind you!”, Tatsuya spun around and tangled the two members together. The two Kenjutsu members ran into each other and rolled to the ground.

Silence filled the room again. It was completely silent in the arena.

If there were any sound effects at this moment, it would be the sound of a boiling point reaching its peak.

Because in the next moment, the entire Kenjutsu club started attacking Tatsuya.

Screams arose from the crowd and everyone who wasn’t involved (including the Kendo members) started running away to avoid the brawl.

Sayaka was the only one in the crowd who stepped forward to help Tatsuya.

“Wait, Mibu.”

A 3rd Year upperclassman from the same Kendo club grabbed her wrist.

“Ah, Tsukasa-senpai.”

She resisted for a moment, but when she saw the person who grabbed her wrist, she let him pull her away from the scene. Her face was overcome with guilt from running away from the fight, but she couldn’t let go of the 3rd Year Kendo Male Club President’s hand.

As the Male Club President took Sayaka away from the brawl, Tatsuya was in the middle of it, getting ready to take the Kenjutsu members head on.

Well, not necessarily “head on” as in counter attacking; all he did was dodge and parry the attacks the “Blooms” unleashed on him.

Tatsuya’s movements were not graceful; they were solid, or even certain if there is a right word for it. It’s almost as if he could tell the order the upperclassmen were going to attack from all directions; all he made were the minimal necessary movements. He stayed calm during the ordeal and showed no signs of being cornered. When they cooperated to drive him in a corner, he merely did a feint and had them hit each other; when they came at him like a wall, he skillfully wove his way through it.

Even though more than 10 people were attacking him at once, they weren’t even able to disrupt his breathing, let alone stop him in place.

The Blooms understood in anger that this insolent Weed wasn’t attacking back not because he couldn’t, but because he didn’t even need to.

This caused the rest of the Kenjutsu members to activate their CADs in anger. But when they lit it up to shoot up magic towards him, nothing happened.

Whenever Tatsuya looked in their directions, they were filled with motion sickness and their blocks of Psion dissipated into thin air.

The Kenjutsu members cursed as they couldn’t understand what was going on, but they merely proceeded to attack Tatsuya with their fists.

All the while, Sayaka didn’t notice that her Male President was observing the situation out of curiosity.





Afterword




Everyone, nice to meet you. Satou Tsutomu here.

Thank you very much for picking up this book.

This “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” that became my debut work in a novel-posting site since October 2008 was edited and revised in the published serialization.

This work was written entirely as a hobby, then received an offer to be published out of luck.

It was started from an email I received from the great administrator of the novel-posting site.

That email was sent by the people from ASCII Media Works, and the text transmitted was a words of invitation, “We want to discuss the terms for publication.”

To be honest, I doubted my eyes.

Entertainment novel is my number one hobby.

I also love reading and writing.

Therefore, as an entertainment novel writer, I had the desire to publish my works in the stage of books since long ago.

While being a salaryman who will never get promoted, I applied this novel that I wrote in my spare time to the publisher’s rookie of the year award.

However, this kind of thing was allowed precisely because “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” was freely published on the web by an amateur and a self-evaluated work.

Dealing with a reputable publisher is an adventure isn’t it~?

I remembered how I wished that this was somebody else’s problem.

Actually, the aforementioned publisher’s award I applied to was Dengeki Novel Prize by ASCII Media Works, but my competition entry was easily defeated.

If you allow me to make an excuse, it was because I had to tightly compress the amount of sentences of this work into half due to the application’s regulation.

I even felt, “Isn’t this unreasonable?”

But I accepted my defeat.

“The world is not that sweet” is one of the few useful lessons I learned in my life as a salaryman.

However, an “unexpectedly nice” event also occurs in life once in a while.

After a chat started with a usual greeting with the person from editorial department of Dengeki Bunko that I met (although probably keeping his name secret is unnecessary, I will call him M-sama in accordance to the custom).

I was really surprised when asked, “Aren’t you ‘XXXX’-san who wrote ‘XXXX’?”.

The work that I applied to Dengeki Novel Prize was this work, although they shared some settings, the style of the SF was completely different, moreover the pen name was also written using kanji notation of an English-American name by the phonetic equivalent.

Please remember that it somehow happened with my rejected work, but if you read this work on the web and a “This setting, I remember seeing it somewhere before” caught in your antenna, it seems that was the reason I was called out.

It seems M-sama was also hesitating to change a free content into a paid service, he was very worried about what the web readers would think were he in their position.

I also thought about that. However, because of the long economic recession, downturn of the company, and overtime’s restriction, headwind was blowing my salaryman profession, so I thought “It’ll be hard if I don’t look for a side job huh. But then, I will no longer have any time to write a novel.”

That being the case, this was the best thing I could ask for in order to continue writing this work.

The world is really not that sweet, but sometimes waiting for good luck = sweet event.

And of course, this good luck was the offer of publication from M-sama.

And since we were publishing a work that originated on the web, this publication also received various help from the administrators of the site “Let’s Become a Novelist”.

But above all, thanks to all of you who have supported this work so far.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.

I also want to express my gratitude to Kawahara-sensei who gave me a great honor with his recommendation words, Ishida-sama who added substantial value to this work with his illustrations, Stone-sama who did the mechanical design, Suenaga-sama who did the color coordination, and all of the staff who were involved in the making of this book.

And more than anything, to all of you who picked up this work, this book that I am so fortunate to be able to deliver, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

This is not the end of my good luck, so I’ll do my best to deliver the next volume of this story to everyone, please also support me in the future.

The Late Great Favourite




Kawahara Reki



Errr, when I was asked to write the recommendation words for “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” from the editor in charge of the story, Mr. M, I immediately replied in excitement “I’ll do it! I’ll do it! I’ll write two thousand pages!” while looking at him with a rather presumptuous or maybe a rather arrogant look… Since the container for a recommendation commentary that long is impossible to exist, I humbly ask you to please read these pages as column instead.

In this preface, I’m afraid I would suddenly start from my personal affairs. I, Kawahara Reki, got his first book published by Dengeki Bunko in 2009. At that time, there was almost no case of a novel published in the web as amateur work will be published as it is commercially (aimed at young adults). In these two years, considerable amount of «Web Adaptation» were published by all companies. I felt that web novel’s existence has been completely recognized. Then this time, there is the long-awaited publication from Dengeki Bunko, “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” (“Mahouka” from now on).

If you are a reader, then I think you already know that “Mahouka” was serialized in novel-posting site «Let’s Become a Novelist» from October 2008, and concluded in March 2011 as a very long work. What’s more, it was leading the popularity ranking by a large margin for a long period of time and gained a remarkable 30 million page views.

Although I can’t possibly have enough space to thoroughly write about the charm of “Mahouka” which has gathered so much support, in short, I think I can say it was an «Online Novel that has Unique Deviation» that effectively and splendidly exhibited.

For example, if “Mahouka” was written as a competition manuscript for rookie of the year award, even with its persistently constructed magic theory and many colorful characters who made an appearance one by one from the start, it didn’t omit a significant portion of the story to fit the regulation. Also, online novel do not have any limitation other than the «Author’s Limit». So it is possible for the author to write a massive amount of settings, lot of characters, and a gradually breathtaking developments to one’s heart’s content.

Certainly, it was also a large deviation from the theory of business. What can convert that deviation to charm, in my personal opinion, is only the «Amount of Material», in other words only the amount of the text written. Although earlier I said it was the author’s limit, I’m having difficulty with the two series I’m writing as its scale become larger and larger. Anyway, with online novel, what gives an author motivation is only the readers’ comments (in the early stage, even that is nonexistent…). When we have passion as the energy source to create, and earnestly connect it when writing something which deviates from theory, surely that work will emit a dazzling charm.

“Mahouka” is a rare work that breaks through that very limit and rapidly ascended to the top. The total amount of text the author, Mr. Satou Tsutomu, written in two and a half years surpassed the production pace of most professional writers. For all of you dear readers who just entered the world of “Mahouka” from Dengeki Bunko, please look forward for the work to keep expanding its world from now on.

And, although so far I regrettably had been writing in formal language, the prime example of the deviation’s charm in “Mahouka” is, if you want to be loved by Miyuki-san more than her Onii-sama, I believe that you have to take Tatsuya-kun’s position as the strongest first! For Tatsuya-kun who got magnificent illustration from Mr. Ishida Kana and became more excellent and brilliant than ever, I think Miyuki-san will surely show us even more rampage if that ever happens and continuing publication would not be fun anymore.

“Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” is certainly the Late Great Favourite from the world of online novel.

Notes




Siblings (兄妹): Written as elder brother + younger sister.

Reserve: This may be confusing, but the word here is not referring to Miyuki’s substitute for the representative post. Reserves/Substitutes here refer to Course 2 students.

Taijutsu (体術, literally “body technique” or “body skill”): Is a Japanese blanket term for any combat skill, technique or system of martial art using body movements that are described as an empty-hand combat skill or system.

Fermions: A fermion can be an elementary particle, such as the electron, or it can be a composite particle, such as the proton. According to the spin-statistics theorem in any reasonable relativistic quantum field theory, particles with integer spin are bosons, while particles with half-integer spin are fermions.

Bosons: In quantum mechanics, a boson is a particle that follows Bose–Einstein statistics. Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions.

Chiba: The number in Chiba(千葉) is Sen(千), which means one thousand.

School Years: Tatsuya is essentially eleven months older than Miyuki. With the exception of universities, all public school years in Japan are trimester-based and start in April and end in March the following year.

Azusayumi (梓弓): An azusayumi is a kind of sacred bow used in some Shinto rituals. Rather than an archery bow, it is more of a musical bow instead.

Shinai (竹刀): Is a weapon used for practice and competition in kendo representing a Japanese sword. Shinai are also used in other martial arts, but may be styled differently from kendo shinai, and represented with different characters.
