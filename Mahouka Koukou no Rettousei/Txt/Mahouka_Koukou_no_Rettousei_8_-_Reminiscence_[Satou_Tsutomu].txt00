The World Affairs as of AD 2095




With the global drop in temperature, then World War III and twenty years of continuous warfare, the world map has been totally redrawn. The current situation is shown as follows.

The United States linked with Canada and every Central American nation from Mexico to Panama to form the USNA.

Russia reabsorbed Ukraine and Belarus to form the New Soviet Union.

China conquered the northern parts of Burma, Vietnam, Laos, and the entire Korean Peninsula to form the Great Asian Alliance.

India and Iran took in Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan) and South Asia (Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka) to form the Indo-Persian Union.

The rest of the nations formed their own military alliances in defiance to the Big Three.

Australia chose de facto seclusion.

The European Union failed, breaking up to east and west along the Franco-German border. With both sides not forming their into unified countries, their respective unions were considerably weaker than they were before the wars.

Half of the African nations disappeared, and the remaining nations have effective sovereignty no further than their cities.

Apart from Brazil, South America has collapsed into small local-level countries.





Strategic-Level Magicians (The Thirteen Apostles)




As modern magic is created from highly advanced science and technology, few countries were able to develop strong military-grade magics. As a result, only a handful of countries were able to develop strategic-level magics that would rival weapons of mass destruction.

However with the continuing practice of providing developed magics to ally nations, it is also usual to acknowledge allied magicians as strategic-level magicians for their high capabilities with strategic-level magics.

As of April 2095, there are thirteen magicians publicly announced nationally for their skill in strategic-level magics. They were called the Thirteen Apostles, and were seen as a big factor in the world’s military balance. Their affiliations, names, and magics were detailed below.

Chapter 1




November 6th, AD 2095 / Yotsuba Main House - Reception Room

A rather large building done in the style of a traditional samurai residence.

That is the impression of the Yotsuba Main House as seen from outside the gate.

Compared to a typical residence it is certainly spacious. Even calling it a mansion does not feel like a misnomer.

However, someone who looked at the grand mansions of those like the Saegusa Family and Ichijou Family would probably be rather surprised by its simple snug appearance.

The Yotsuba do not care about the spaciousness of their house. Because the Yotsuba Family, who maintain a systematic policy of secrecy, would never invite a large number of outsiders as guests. Perhaps they think a grand mansion would only be an encumbrance.

Without regard to the fact that her mother had been a member of the main family, Miyuki mused over the matter from an outsider’s perspective, as she and her brother stepped through the overpowering structure of the gate together.

That day — the day that would come to be known in the future as “The Scorched Halloween” was only one week ago.

The siblings had brought themselves to the mountain village that was not recorded on any map by foot, in accordance with their aunt’s invitation — which should rather be called a summons to appear before her.

Despite what could be hypothesized from the outside structure, it was a modern and quite expansive reception room that they were ushered into and informed that they were to wait in. This was not a small reception room used for privacy, this was a large room that could be classified as an “Audience Chamber” which let them know that today’s summons was not a personal one from their aunt, but from the Master of Yotsuba Family.

—Well, we had discerned that from the beginning, thought Miyuki, nevertheless.

Three years had passed since I have been summoned to this room with my brother.

Until now for one pretext or another her brother had been excluded on the occasions when the family came together as one to celebrate or share condolences, and their aunt never had direct contact with him. However, it has been three years since he accompanied me, nay, since my brother has been nearby while I had contact with her.

Of course, Miyuki could not determine whether that was a good thing or a bad thing.

“—Don’t worry. We are not the same, as three years ago.”

Her uneasiness had apparently shown on her face. Miyuki tilted her eyes upward to find Tatsuya nodding reassuringly in her line of sight as she peeked at him.

Next to the sofa Miyuki was sitting on, he stood.

Three years ago, he had the same posture.

Three years ago, he had stood behind Miyuki.

Yes… Compared to three years ago, it had changed.

Tatsuya was probably talking about how their abilities had changed from three years ago. Unquestionably, in terms of the power the two of them had there could be no comparison to three years ago. Especially in regards to Tatsuya, he had attained combat power that rivaled that of their aunt, Yotsuba Maya, famed as one of the world’s strongest magicians, known as “The Maou of the Far East” and “The Queen of Night”. If you examine their magic affinities in detail, it would be readily apparent that in a one on one confrontation Tatsuya would win.

However, more than their relationship with their aunt, in terms of abilities, had changed from what it was three years ago, Miyuki thought.

—Such as, the relationship between her brother and herself.

—And the feelings she herself directed towards her brother.

The mind of Miyuki who was sitting on the sofa with perfectly correct posture drifted to that time three years ago…





Chapter 2




August 4th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Naha Airport ~ Onna Serika Vacation home

—Beginning from around Common Era 2030, the earth underwent a radical drop in temperature; the world’s overall food supply deteriorated on a massive scale. Since around 2020, advanced agriculture production came to be a solar-powered industry and this limited the influence it had on advanced industrial nations. However, the impact of the damage on the emerging industrial nations that had experienced an accelerated population explosion brought on by radical economic growth was a profound one.

With the drop in temperature and desertification proceeding simultaneously in the North China region, it was confronted with an extremely serious situation.

The residents of North China, in accordance with the traditions of their people, weathered such dire straits. Colonization by Border Transgression — in short, by using illegal immigration.

However, Russia did not assent to the influx of illegal immigrants. This resulted in illegal aliens being thoroughly expunged, even from unpopulated wildernesses and rented out nooks of houses.

Those who possess true power, cannot grow weary of bloodshed.

China admonished Russia in the name of humanitarianism; Russia admonished China in the name of international law.

The antagonism of both nations was not confined between them.

Crossing national borders in the name of humanitarianism is banned by international law.

Throughout the world, kindling was laid just waiting for a match.

In this environment, there was a food shortage caused by temperature dropping.

There was a struggle over energy resources to be used to alleviate the problem.

For the kindling to become an inferno, even a slight impetus would have been enough.

In Common Era 2045, World War Three — an outbreak of 20 years of wars clustered across the world started.

From 2045 to 2064, wide scale border disputes throughout the world made this an era of continuous war.

Not a single nation was able to remain a bystander; this was truly a world war.

When the conflicts finally ceased, the world’s population was a third of the size it had been in 2045; it had been decreased to 3 billion people.

Russia reabsorbed Ukraine and Belarus into the New Soviet Union (ShinSoRen); China governed over the northern parts of Burma, Vietnam, and Laos as well as the Korean peninsula through the Great Asia Alliance (Asian Alliance); India and Iran devoured various countries in central Asia to construct the Indo-Persia Union; the USA absorbed Canada and Mexico to fuse all of North America into one nation (USNA); the EU split into eastern and western parts; half of the various countries of Africa dissolved; in South America, aside from Brazil, the region was divided into small countries where governments did not have much reach beyond their own location.

The world had been transformed this way by 20 years of warfare, even though it never resorted to nuclear warfare, and magicians were one part of this world and its transformation.

In 2046, “The International Magic Federation” was established.

Their purpose was to prevent the pollution of the earth beyond what it could recover from through the use of radioactive materials in weapons of mass destruction.

Within the bounds of their stated purpose to halt the use of nuclear weapons, magicians freed themselves from the yokes of the countries they belonged to and were permitted to intervene with their skills in border disputes. Even magicians on the front lines taking part by killing each other would cease their skirmish when they observed signs of the use of nuclear weapons; whether it was their own country or their enemy’s country, they would cooperate to stop the deployment of nuclear weapons.

The banning of nuclear weapons has been established as the paramount duty of magicians around the world.

This pact, “The International Magic Federation’s Charter”, targets radioactive materials that can be used for weapons that contaminate the environment. Strictly speaking, that does not include clean nuclear bombs. However, since in order to detonate a state of the art nuclear bomb made to be use for great battles, a small nuclear bomb was indispensable, this resulted in a complete ban on nuclear weapons.

Thus, in the period of war that lasted twenty years, there was not a single usage of nuclear weapons.

The International Magic Federation was honored for this achievement. Internationally recognized as an agency of peace even after the world war ended, it occupies a position of prestige—



I heard the announcement that it was time to put on my seat belt and closed the file of teaching material in “Contemporary History - A Guide” that related to magicians. The contents were a little difficult for someone like me who had just become a middle school student, but it was sufficient to keep me from being bored.

I had heard that modern airplanes were not subject to failure caused by electromagnetic interference generated by information terminals. However, turning information terminals off during takeoffs and landings was a traditional courtesy. Not only me, the other passengers also turned their terminals off. I did not intend to be the only one disobeying the rules of common sense like a spoiled child.

The seat was covered by an egg shaped safety shield, a real-time image of a southern island was projected on the interior.

Looking at that vivid greenery and sparkling ocean, makes the world’s temperature drop seem like an event in a fictional story.

Nevertheless, that event is an unequivocal fact.

Before we were born, the world’s climate began getting warmer but, we can look at the traces of the temperature dropping all around us.

For example, the dress code.

Not exposing bare skin, this manner in which we dress is nothing but a trace of the deep impression the era of the temperature dropping left on the world.

Well, I have no interest in dressing to expose my shoulders or breast area — and in the first place, it would not be a flattering style on me, yet—, it’s not compulsory to have a skirt so long the hem drags, and I like clothes. However in private places, there are no rules over the manner of dressing so it’s not like it really hinders us.

While I am thinking of these trivial things, the airplane touched down at Naha airport.

I could hardly feel any tremors from the landing.

The seat belt that was only a meaningless formality unlocked and I opened the shield of the capsule seat.

Underneath was a regular seat, the seat was so narrow my elbow collided with it, it seemed like we were crammed in here without a trace of civility but, if I had to put up with who knows how many people I don’t know and had never seen before at point blank range for an hour, I wouldn’t be able to endure it.

I waited for Okaa-sama to leave her seat. Together we turned to the passenger exit.

We were using the summer break for a private family vacation trip.

A family trip was originally a private matter, I think, but in the case of our family trips, they were almost never private. Even so I was regrettably cheerful.

The only cloud on the horizon was that it was not just Okaa-sama and I, Ani[2] would also be with us.




When we left the VIP lounge in the arrival lobby, Ani had already gone and picked up our checked in luggage and was waiting for us.

Having Ani travel all by himself and get the luggage wasn’t some form of petty meanness.

Executive Class passengers had precedence when it came to disembarking from the plane. Their luggage also had precedence in being returned, nay, as expected he did have to wait a little. Considering the time it took to get the luggage ready for pick up, having Ani, who was a commercial class passenger, go and pick up the luggage for us is not pointless.

Naturally, there is a proper reason for Ani to be seated in commercial class alone.

In Executive Class, in addition to the normal cabin attendant, special crew members who specialize in handling violence act as guards and keep a watchful eye. If a criminal incident like a hijacking, suicide bomber or such were to occur, it would be in the loosely guarded commercial class. Ani is assigned a commercial class seat, for the sake of handling such an unlikely occurrence. That being said — even I acknowledge that the way my family handles such matters is not normal.

While I walk with Okaa-sama, I happen to glance over my shoulder. Ani is pushing the cart carrying our luggage all alone as if it were perfectly normal without a trace of dissatisfaction on his face, silently trailing us.

Like he always does.

I do not particularly hate this Ani.

I merely have trouble interacting with him.

I have no idea what he could possibly be thinking.

Why, is he commonly treated like a servant when he is family? If he were a servant, it would probably be normal to be calm at receiving this treatment.

I know I have been told that this is the duty he has been assigned to do.

I also acknowledge our family’s uniqueness.

Nevertheless, Ani is only a first year middle school student like me.

Ani was born in April and I was born in March.

We were born within a year of each other, so we are in the same school year. This is only a coincidence brought about by our birth months. However, all the same, this does not change the fact that until March of this year he was an elementary school student like me.

Considering that fact, how can he take to being ordered about by me, his younger sister so calmly—

The eyes of Ani and I met.

My several glances over my shoulder are probably bothering him.

“…What is it?”

I recognize that the reason Ani also directed his eyes towards me is because I have been looking at him intermittently.

However, from my mouth only a repulsive voice came out.

“It is nothing.”





Ani responded in a polite tone like one a butler might use to address the mistress of the house he was serving.

Like or dislike, the love of a brother for his sister or the hatred of close kin; all those emotions a brother might direct to a younger sister or a close relative were not there.

“If that is so, please do not stare at me. It is uncomfortable!”

I acknowledge that I am being unreasonable.

We are the ones who are treating Ani as a servant, there is no reason for Ani to wish such a thing.

Despite that, I selfishly strike at Ani with my irritation.

“Pardon me.”

Ani halted and bowed his head towards me.

And put a little more distance between us than there had been until then as he followed behind us.

Why, I thought.

Just now I was merely being self-centered. I am such a disagreeable child.

—Just like I thought, I have trouble interacting with this Ani.




The place we are staying in this time is a recently purchased vacation home in Onna Serika. I would have been fine with a hotel, but since Okaa-sama does not handle places with numerous people well, Chichi[3] hurriedly prepared this for us.

As usual that man appears to think that he can use money to buy affection. …Even though that money is what he married Okaa-sama to obtain.

Although Chichi was extraordinary when he was young — since even for a magician, he posses an above normal quantity of psions, his potential power made him highly prized as a magician. It seems however, according to the current magic technical system the quantity of psions possessed does not influence the superiority or inferiority of magic ability. In the end, that man could not make his potential power into actual power; he renounced trying to make his life a success as a magician. Currently he is installed as an executive in a company created by Okaa-sama’s family.

Because of those particulars, I can understand why he is deferential to Okaa-sama. Yet, as his daughter, I wish he would display a more father-like uprightness.

…I lightly shook my head to chase away these pointless reflections from inside my mind. After all I am on vacation, I am aware that being trapped in unpleasant thoughts is foolish.



“Welcome, Oku-sama. It is good that you have come, also Miyuki-san, Tatsuya-kun.”

The one who came out to greet us at the vacation house was Sakurai Honami, who had been sent slightly ahead of us in order to take care of the cleaning, shopping, and other such things for us.

She is Okaa-sama’s Guardian.

Until five years ago, Sakurai-san was a SP of the Metropolitan Police Department. I believe that they quite strongly attempted to impede her departure when she resigned. However, it had been decided that she would be Okaa-sama’s Guardian before she sought employment with the Metropolitan Police Department. Joining the Metropolitan Police Department was for the purpose of learning the ins and outs of guard operations.

She is a modified magician whose genetic structure has been altered to strengthen her disposition for magic, a member of the first generation of the “Sakura” Series. During the waning days of the 20 years of continuous border conflicts, she was constructed at a research institute, a magician bought by the Yotsuba Family before she was born.

Nonetheless, she is a cheerful, lively woman who does not seem to feel the weight of her personal history. Aside from her main duty of protection operations, she takes care of Okaa-sama’s everyday necessities with great attention to detail for us. According to her, she finds the role of housekeeper the more congenial role.

It ran counter to the image of a Guardian to abandon her protection operations, but she came ahead of us to the vacation house in order to gather knowledge about the current status of this area, since Ani would be close to Okaa-sama and me. That being said, I wished Sakurai-san and Ani had switched duties. —But, since taking care of the details of providing a comfortable household would be impossible for Ani, that would be pointless.

“Now, please come in. There is chilled barley tea ready. Or else, I can also make some green tea if you would like me to?”

“Thank you. Since it has already been made, I’ll have the barley tea.”

“Yes, ma’am. Miyuki-san, Tatsuya-kun, is barley tea alright for you as well?”

“Yes, thank you very much.”

“Since you have troubled yourself to make it.”

There is only one thing about Sakurai-san that might be called unsatisfactory, it is that she treats Ani as Okaa-sama’s son — and as my brother.

It goes without saying that this is a natural thing to do.

However, I am…unable to do that natural thing.

At times like this, I am irrationally vexed with myself for that reason.



“Okaa-sama, I would like to take a short walk.”

I am aware that since we have just arrived, things are too unsettled for me to go for a swim. But on the other hand, being shut up in the vacation house would be wasteful, so I would like to take a walk. Walking to Manzamou would be impossible because it is a little too far, but just walking leisurely along the path alongside the beach would undoubtedly feel pleasant.

“Miyuki-san, have Tatsuya accompany you on your walk.”

Unfortunately, when I heard Okaa-sama’s reply, I felt that my long awaited walk was spoiled from the start.

I really wished to proclaim that I would be alright alone, however I did not want to worry her too much.

“—I understand.”

It took all my strength to keep my voice from being petulant.

I pulled my wide brimmed straw hat low, did not look behind, and walked out beneath the waning rays of the sun.

The ocean breeze fluttering the hem of my summer dress is as relaxing as I thought it would be.

I received help from Sakurai-san in order to apply sun block from head to toe without missing a spot, so I could feel the wind on my arms and legs without concern for the sun’s rays.

With my skin covered in brown cream, I think that I don’t look much different when compared to a local child.

Probably, thanks to that I am not stared at when I pass by someone, this is a comfortable feeling.

My skin has never known the feeling of tanning in the sun, it is not conceited to say that I am regrettably conspicuous in places like a beach.

—Nay, I am really not conceited about it.

I have a memory of going to a pool with my elementary school friends and being deeply horrified by being told that I looked like a “Yuki-Onna[4]”, even now, I cannot blot it out. The remark was excessively horrifying because it was a thoughtless remark, not by any means an attempt to bully me or to maliciously talk behind my back or anything like that.

There is no way I am lacking in my pigmentation. It’s just that my hair is a shade of black too deep.

Could it be hereditary? But, my family line is not supposed to be intermingled with Europeans for the past five generations…well, since I do not know any farther than that; the possibility that this comes from some long ago genetic ancestor is not nonexistent. However, even Okaa-sama becomes a little darker in the summer and Ani’s complexion could be called tanned, since it so splendidly soaks up the sun so much that I can no longer tell what his original color is, so I do not believe it could be called a hereditary thing.

“——”

I have been remembering and contemplating things that I do not wish to, I consciously focused ahead in order to not look back, too consciously. …What should I do with my mind, I am so perplexed.

Although my ears are unobstructed, I can not hear the sound of footsteps. There is no sign of someone being there. —Naturally, I have no skill at detecting someone’s presence to begin with, but still.

If I turned around, however, undeniably at a little distance away, Ani is accompanying me.

Because Ani is my Guardian.

Why do I not use “bodyguard” but a grandiose term like “Guardian”, I do not understand. Not even a single reason why, even now. However, a “Guardian” of Yotsuba is somehow different from a simple “bodyguard”, that is something I think I am able to understand.

A bodyguard does a “job”, a guardian performs a “duty”.

Bodyguards risk their lives to protect the ones they are guarding in exchange for earning a monetary reward. There are cases like an SP of the police who conduct protection operations as part of their professional duties, but since those people also receive a salary for their professional duties, I think that they unmistakably meet the broad definition of occupations that receive monetary compensation.

In contrast to that, Guardians receive no monetary rewards. All the necessities of living are provided by Yotsuba. Whenever cash is needed, Yotsuba supplies it. To be correct that is not a reward, it is the cost of maintaining the power of protection.

I conclude that it is thus, a bodyguard protects in order to eat; a Guardian eats in order to protect.

Guardians have no private life of their own. All of them, the male Guardians and the female Guardians, are devoted to serve and protect the person they call Master or Mistress.

We are a clan that thinks that this is perfectly normal and I too, find it so. If you cannot think that this is normal, the only thing you can do is withdraw. However, we are “Yotsuba”. —Even if I am somewhat embarrassed to be called Mistress, I feel that that is preferable to being expelled, but still. I am happy when we are away from the clan; “Guardians” do not normally use the designations of “Master” or “Mistress” when we are not inside the clan.

Ani became my Guardian when I was six years old. My first Guardian is Ani, this is probably something that will not be changed for a long time.

That person is not the son of the elder sister of the head of the Yotsuba Clan, he is the Guardian of a candidate to be the next head. If I become the head, he will be my shadow. Until my life ends, it will be that way.

As long as I do not relieve him of his duty as a Guardian.

Yes, that is the single way a Guardian can escape his duty and be allowed to live the life of a normal person - for a Guardian to be dismissed by the one he guards.

He accompanies me.

He follows behind me.

I cannot be separated from him.

He cannot escape from me.

The one who will not escape is me.

The one who is unable to escape is him.

Despite the fact that I am the only person that can let him return to the life of an ordinary middle school student.

The one who keeps Ani from being able to be an ordinary middle school student is me. Because I will not release Ani.



—I do not know how to interact with Ani.

—I do not hate Ani.



Then why am I confining him to this cruel condition?

The answer does not come.

Whenever I think about this matter, for some reason my mind goes blank.

With my gaze fixated on the ground beneath my feet, I quickened my pace.

I had my eyes cast downward and my feet going at a fast walk. Suddenly, my arm was grabbed and it seemed like I was going to fall backward.

Immediately, before I impacted with what would be a thud, I deplorably fell into Ani’s arms.

I made no complaint to Ani.

What happened just now is my fault, who was not looking ahead. —The fact that I reflexively raised my voice is a secret; I have no intention of telling anyone.

The problem is that after my body was restrained by Ani, I received an impact from the front. I was not the one who bumped into someone, clearly I had been the one bumped.

Even though I am angry, this is obviously a set up.

I focus my anger filled gaze upward. However, all I could see is a bulky wall of muscles.

I set my gaze even higher.

Finally, I knew the identity of the one who bumped into me.

A big black male teenager[5], who wore a disheveled worn out army uniform — a “Left Blood”.

Due to the intensification of the twenty years of continuous border conflicts, the American (at the time it was still the USA) forces garrisoned in Okinawa eventually withdrew to Hawaii and left behind their children. The majority of them were not abandoned by their parents, but rather because their fathers had died in the war. However, many of them were taken in and raised by the National Defense force who had inherited the base, afterwards they became part of the military.

They are valiant soldiers who superbly fulfill the duty of defending the border, and many of their children also become soldiers. However, a private Okinawa Tourist Guide website contained an article warning that many of those children, in short the second generation, were known for behaving badly so one should be wary of them.

Behind the large youth, there were two teenagers also wearing old tattered army uniforms in a sloppy manner with similar builds, releasing sneering laughter in a nauseating fashion.

My reflexive anger was naturally changed into fear.

My mind was so crammed with fear that the natural thought that if the worst happens, I can use magic, could not be formed.

—Until my field of vision was blocked by Ani’s back.

It was the lean back of a young boy.

Nevertheless, it was a broader back than mine.

I did not notice when it started, but I was being sheltered by Ani’s back.

“Hey, I got no business with a brat like you?”

Disdaining us with scorn, the big youth peered at Ani’s face.

Ani made no response.

“You’re too scared to speak?”

“Ha ha, a chicken boy. Only trying to show off!”

The two youths behind him deride and threaten Ani.

The anger in my heart is rejuvenated.

Compared to before, their plan is more obvious.

“Should have taken my CAD with me”, I lamented. I can’t control the effects of my power very well when I lack an assisting tool. Causing serious injuries even to someone like this would be awkward in various ways.

If I had access to a CAD, these jerks would not be saying whatever they like!

Not even I myself understood why on earth I was burning with such rage. I glared at the big teenager barring the path in front of Ani.

The big teen’s eyes looked at me and narrowed.

His lips moved.

It could have been to laugh, it could have been to speak. There is no way to tell.

“Since we have no intention of begging you to mercifully forgive us for bumping into you, turn away from this course of action. For both of our sakes.”

The calm tone was not that of someone who could be called a boy, the big teen’s face stiffened due to the completely unchild-like statement.

“—What did you say?”

It was a low faint whisper-like query.

“You should have been able to hear?”

The retort completely lacked emotion as if it was a mere comment made to oneself.

In both of the teen’s eyes, an evil glint nested.

“Even if you press your head to the ground, I won’t forgive you. For now, I’ll let you off with bruises.”

“If you are talking about Dogeza[6], you shouldn’t say head, you have to say forehead.”

Immediately, afterwards.

With no sign or previous indication, the teen struck out at Ani.

Even though Ani was a teenager as well, Ani still had the body of a first year middle school student. The difference between him and the big youth before my eyes was that of an adult and a child.

I reflexively closed my eyes.

There was a thud like sound.

I just realized that if Ani was struck, then I, who was behind him, would become involved as well. I thought it was strange that that had not occurred.

Timidly, I open my eyes.

The first sight that entered my vision was the face of the big teen frozen in disbelief.

There was no need to worry about what could cause him to make such a look.

The teen’s right arm was extended in an incomplete punch.

Ani was stopping the fist with two hands.

Although it was two arms versus one arm, the difference between the weight of their two bodies was such that it should not have made any difference.

The mass of the big teen’s body was probably over two times that of Ani.

Despite that fact, Ani was not warding off the blow. Without taking even one step back to brace himself, Ani was taking the full weight the big teen was putting into that punch head on and stopping it.

Did he use magic? —No, there was no indication of that.

In things like academics, physical strength, and agility, Ani was more capable. But in magic, I am supposed to be more capable than Ani. If Ani used magic then there is no way I would be unaware of it.

“Interesting…I only intended to play around with you but…”

Grinning broadly, the big teen pulled back his arm and assumed a posture with his left fist in front of his chest.

Boxing?

Karate?

I, a complete novice in combat and martial arts was unable to recognize which it is. However, somehow even I could discern that the foe who had been half playing before had become serious.

I forgot about fleeing, from the shadow behind that boy’s back I peeped at the big teenager.

That boy’s lackadaisical comment plunged into my ears, who said nothing and stilled my breath.

“Are you sure? It’s going to be no laughing matter if we go beyond this point.”

Why are you speaking in such a provocative manner?!

Typically if someone like you took him on, you would not be able to match him.

Typically, people of our age should flee in this situation.

No, Ani’s intentions do not matter.

I should flee even if I have to do it alone.

—Despite what I was thinking in my head, my body did not leave its place behind Ani’s back.

“You’re spouting a lot of trash talk for a brat!”

What happened next could not be caught with my eyes.

I could only understand the results, everything else is mere conjecture about what occurred.

The teen’s left leg advanced forward.

The teen’s left leg and right leg were placed in what looked like a fighting stance, Ani placed his left leg forward.

The teen’s left hand was aiming for Ani’s collar, just as the lunging fist seemed about to connect.

Ani’s left fist was propping him up from its position on the middle of his chest.

In that short blur of time, more than this seemed to have occurred but some time was unmistakably used by the big teen to spring back using the recoil.

Do-on, a sound like that of a Taiko[7] being struck, surely that was the sound of Ani’s fist.

Ani withdrew the leg he had placed forward, and as if it were a prearranged signal, the big teen’s body sank; cries of pain arose from where he was down on both knees on the surface of the road.

Ani looked past the big teenager who was crouching down and coughing painfully, and quietly directed his eyes to the people behind him.

Like they were petrified, the two male teens did not move.

Ani turned his back on them.

“Let’s go.”

Ani took my arm in his hand.

At last, I became aware that those softly murmured words were directed towards me.





“Miyuki-san, did something happen?”

When I returned from my aborted walk, Sakurai-san paled and rushed over to me in a small sprint.

I did not think my face looked that terrible, but even I myself realized that I had turned a little pale. So, from the outset, I made no attempt to deceive her.

“It was a minor…unfortunate encounter with a young man.”

“Well…!”

With only that Sakurai-san seemed to have discerned the gist of the situation.

Nonchalantly, she made a survey of my person, probably checking to see if my clothes were in disarray.

“I am fine.”

It was a bit of a strain but, I think my smile was natural.

When I directed my smile to her, Sakurai-san also returned a relieved smile to me.

However, I could not continue smiling for long.

Because Ani saved me — that phrase did not depart from my mouth.

I shifted my focus from the words I thought to say, Ani was feigning ignorance; his face was, as always, expressionless. He bowed lightly to Sakurai-san. Despite that, his eyes never turned toward me and withdrew to an inner room.

Regrettably, the painfully constructed smile I had made seems to be about to crumble.

“—Taking a shower will rinse off the sweat.”

There was no sweat on me, but I used that as a pretext to take refuge in the shower room.

The hot water of the shower bounced off my skin.

I forgot to remove the water repellent cream, so I merely felt the heat. This allowed my body that seemed about to shake to warm.

“Why…”

I took my head out from under the spray of the shower. Hot drops outline my face, by the corner of my eyes and above my cheekbones, different kinds of drops intermingle.

“Why am I crying…?”

A bemused voice reached my own ears. It was not a tearful voice, it was as if it was somebody else’s voice.

“Why do I have to cry?”

Panicking, I even try shouting. There is no answer. I am the only one here.

“Why…Why…”

The only sound that I can hear is the sound of the shower. No one will give me an answer to my question.





Chapter 3




November 6th, AD 2095 / Yotsuba Main House - Drawing room

“Oh my.”

Upon hearing Tatsuya’s utterance as he looked out the window facing the courtyard, Miyuki’s consciousness returned from the past to the present.

“Onii-sama?”

“It’s the Kuroba elder sister and younger brother.”

Glancing up at his sister’s question, Tatsuya answered with a slight look of surprise.

“Ayako-san and Fumiya-kun?”

Although his flicker of surprise was faint, it didn’t escape Miyuki’s notice. Having risen halfway, she hurriedly tried to correct her posture, before thinking better of it and sitting back down with a flop.

“It seems they just came out.”

The complex the Kuroba siblings were coming from was the place their grandmother, the little sister of Tatsuya and Miyuki’s deceased grandfather, as well as aunt to the current head Maya lived.

Kuroba Fumiya is the number two candidate for succession to the Yotsuba family headship. It was no wonder they’d visit their grandmother. Miyuki wasn’t surprised by their presence here in and of itself.

“……Maybe it’s just a coincidence?”

“They’re not exactly the type who would just pass by while knowing that we’re here though.”

That’s certainly true, Miyuki thought.

“Whether by a wide or narrow margin, it seems fate has decided our missing each other was not to be.”

A very noncommittal answer.

Thinking the same thing as her brother, Miyuki’s mind wandered back to the events of another chance encounter one night…





Chapter 4




August 4th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Vacation House ~ Hotel Party

Although we came here on vacation, the bonds of society and family cannot be severed, regrettably. I have just barely become a middle school student but that does not mean that there are no people whose invitation I cannot decline.

Only blood relations which are not very many people, as it is said even the darkest cloud has a silver lining… however, I had completely no intimation that any of those people would be in the same place at the same time as me.

The one who sent the invitation was Kuroba Mitsugu-san. This person is Okaa-sama’s cousin.

The hand of the clock is pointing to 6 PM. It is nearly the time that I have to depart the vacation house.

I sat in front of a mirror with a brush in my hand.

“Ha…”

Without thinking, I allowed a sigh to escape from my mouth. The me in the mirror was wearing a distinctly dispirited look.

I am not ill at ease at parties. However, I have just traveled from Tokyo to Okinawa this very day. I wanted to take it easy for at least this evening.

“Miyuki-san, have you finished getting ready?”

After a knock, a voice sounded through the door. It seems that Sakurai-san has come to call on me who is lingering in her own room.

“Uh, yes.”

I, who had been contemplating the whispers of my thoughts, reflexively stood up to give my answer.

Interpreting my reply as permission to enter, Sakurai-san opened the door. —Certainly, it could be that kind of signal, so I did not get particularly flustered but,

“What’s this? Aren’t you all ready to go?”

Seeing that I had changed into a cocktail dress, put on a necklace, a hair band and also had my purse in my hand, Sakurai-san let her feelings show with a painful smile.

“Don’t make such a sullen face or all your finery will go to waste.”

Could my face be so easy to read?

“……Do you understand?”

It was Sakurai-san I faced; nay, that did not change the fact that it was the eyes of another person. I had no intention of letting anyone be aware of my unhappiness.

“As for me,”

While saying that Sakurai-san purposefully gave an exultant wink. …Is she telling me that it is alright to show other people this kind of face?

“Stop…making fun of me, please.”

Without thinking, I made a pouty face. Flustered, I focused on smoothing out my expression into something more ladylike, but…

I could feel my cheeks turning red as I watched Sakurai-san release a giggle.

I am already a middle school student, I thought I had stopped this sort of childish behavior.

“I’m sorry……but,”

You would not think she was 30 years old — you could only think that she was in her twenties at the most — after she giggled for a while looking cute, Sakurai-san quickly modified her expression.

Naturally, I reined in my emotions as well.

“There are people with sharper ‘eyes’ than me, since there are many people in this world. Indeed, it is because I know you so well, Miyuki-san, that I’m also very aware of the things you dislike. However, it is also possible that someone who can read your face with a glance might be at the party. Because you, Miyuki-san, are not an ordinary middle school student, I believe you must appear as if there are no gaps in your defenses.”

No rebellious feelings were aroused by this well aimed advice.

“…Might there be a good way to do it?”

“No matter how well you intend to conceal them, regrettably, feelings are always portrayed in the color of your eyes and every change of your facial expression.”

…Is she saying that nothing can be done?

“What you need to do is to skillfully deceive your own emotions, do you get it? First, you bring you, yourself, in alignment with what you would call your false face.”

Possibly because she read my discontent, Sakurai-san continued in greater detail in a soothing manner.




As she instructed me to, I shrouded my heart with a false face; since I was still very much a child, I could not stop my spirits from falling as I approached the site of the party.

Kuroba Oji-sama[8] was not a bad person. (Strictly speaking, he was not my uncle.)

It’s just that, probably because his wife died young or something, the way he dotes on his children is a little… well, extremely annoying.

Gosh, just what does he think he is doing, bragging about his children to another child? No, this is not how I should feel. He is surely not thinking at all, but I do wish he would confine that topic to his fellow adults.

…Hoo; a sigh escaped my mouth.

Without thought, not consciously.

This was not the time to be expelling sighs. If I am doing this now I may not be able to control myself at the actual party.

I am already within the hotel grounds.

How pointlessly ostentatious — this was only my subjective opinion, but — I could already see the entrance.

The driverless commuter car stopped.

With quick motions, Ani got out of the car, held back the door and begun waiting for me to get out.

My expression stiffened and I advanced on the battlefield of depression and tedium.

In the lobby, there were hard-faced older men, young men, and dignified young women. None of them were trying to stand out, but they were incapable of fooling the eye of I who had been accompanied by people like them from birth.

It was not any of my business, but they made me want to tell them that they should train more.

Naturally, it goes without saying that I was not accompanied by Ani alone this evening.

Two women bodyguards from a security agency with offices around the country were temporarily escorting me.

At the party and on other occasions, there were numerous places where I cannot be with a male companion and the opposite is also true. If Sakurai-san could be here as usual, there would be no need to worry. However, right now she is remaining at Okaa-sama’s side.

Okaa-sama is a little unwell and is resting at the vacation house even now. None of that could be helped. But, due to that, I must deal with Oji-sama alone.

How, depressing.

From the outset, even if Chichi[9] could be relied upon, the duty of entertaining relatives should not fall to me, who is both younger and a girl, the duty should belong to the eldest male child.

I glared at the back of Ani who was walking ahead of me in bitterness.

“Oji-sama, I am so grateful for the invitation.”

As expected, the location was too big a site for a private party. As expected, an extravagant table was being used as a backdrop. As expected, Oji-sama came out to meet me clad in an expensive suit and I made the perfunctory greeting. For this kind of thing, there was no reason for creativity.

“I am glad you came, Miyuki-chan. Is your Okaa-sama well?”

Oji-sama replied with exaggerated friendliness.

Only someone like him, still sticks a “chan” on my name, these days.

And as usual, he ignored Ani’s existence as if he were invisible.

Since Ani only stood behind me in silence, it could be that both of them were ignoring each other.

“Oh how kind of you to be concerned. I think she is only a little tired, but I wanted her to take good care of herself today.”

“I am so relieved to hear that. Oh sorry, I have kept you out here talking. Now, come inside. Both Ayako and Fumiya will be glad to meet you, Miyuki-chan.”

Things that are called natural naturally occur; I expected the two of them to come but…

Despite all the self instruction not to do so, I felt a sigh threatening to leave my mouth.

I attached myself to Oji-sama and went to a table inside the room.

Leaving Ani behind at the entrance.

There was a so called custom of bodyguards placing themselves alongside the wall, ready for action.

Despite being guilty of treating him badly myself, I always felt extremely annoyed when other people treat him as a servant… I am probably just being selfish.

Be that as it may, I am for now forced to deal with the Kuroba family alone and unassisted.

“Ayako-san, Fumiya-kun, are the two of you well?”

Upon my greeting them, Fumiya-kun seemed happy and Ayako-san seemed like she had been waiting for me; their respective smiling faces welcomed me in the usual way.

“Miyuki-neesama! It’s been so long.”

“Onee-sama, you have not changed at all.”

Ayako-san and Fumiya-kun are one grade below me, sixth year elementary school students.

Unlike my brother and I, these two are twins.

They were the same age as me, but because I was born in March and they were born in June they were in a lower grade.

For some reason or other, for as long as I can remember, Ayako-san has always blatantly felt a rivalry with me… This is one more reason dealing with this family was so depressing.

Since the other candidate for successor was not Ayako-san but Fumiya-kun, even if she felt competitive with me… I was supposed to be concealing my true feelings.

Fumiya-kun is adorable because he is openly affectionate to me, but I feel he is a little too adorable for a boy. At any rate, compared to Ani… no, that person is extraordinary.

I see that their clothes are a little too cutesy again today. I must strain myself to keep my facial muscles from moving.

Even with this air conditioning, is it not too warm to wear something like that in this season, Fumiya-kun?

Even if you are wearing it a casual style, to wear a bolero jacket and a cummerbund…since this is a private party, I do not think it is necessary to go so far.

On the other hand, Ayako-san……well, as usual is called as usual for a reason. Her dress was abundantly adorned with ribbons, trims, and decorative buttons, and even her above-the-knee socks had ruffles with ribbons on them. Her hair was prettily arranged in curls, and a fringe had been added to her hair band. I do not particularly want to quibble over someone else’s taste in attire, but this style is probably a little abnormal at a summer resort.

Since both they and their parent wore (dress up) such clothes, I think they made things overly formal, however.

While I am contemplating such things in order to distract myself, Oji-sama was continuing to brag about my cousins. During his boasting about inconsequential things like Ayako-san receiving a prize in a piano competition and Fumiya-kun being praised by his riding instructor, I made polite responses in all the right places and waited for time to pass.

I always wondered if this was some kind of punishment game. However, each time I am blessedly saved before my patience wears too thin. Today also at any moment now Fumiya-kun would begin to fidget.

“By the way, Miyuki-neesama…where is Tatsuya-niisama?”

Ah, here it comes.

Fumiya-kun is a very nice child, he treats Ayako-san and I the same. To be brief, he adores me as much as if I were really his elder sister, but he adores Ani more than either of us; or you might say that he reveres him.

No, I wonder if admires might be a better way to define it? Even so, well, I cannot say that I do not understand.

In general terms — that is in accordance with the guidelines set by the Magic Federation — Ani is not blessed with a talent for magic. However, that person compensates for that with a surfeit of brains, muscles and special talents.

His school grades are outstandingly excellent.

No matter what sport, he is first class; or possibly super first class.

And, the counter attack that all magicians are vulnerable to is that person’s sole trump card.

Surely, Ani is the type of person that all boys might revere as a hero.

No. Surely, not just boys.

His outward appearance is neither amiable, lively nor sweet but despite all that.

Ani is incredibly cool……

……Eh, what on earth am I thinking!?

That person is merely my guard, nothing more.

That person and I only share a sibling relationship through genetics, nothing more.

Why I am acting like I have a brother complex……

“He is on the watch over there.”

As if unaware that a black cloud had suddenly appeared in my heart, I pointed to his position beside the wall while wearing my painstakingly constructed smiling face.

Ah, Fumiya-kun’s cheeks are becoming red.

Apparently, I am fooling them.

“…Um, where exactly?”

Next to Fumiya-kun who had taken his eyes off me to search for Ani by letting his eyes wander all over the room, Ayako-san was also sending her eyes hither and thither along the wall while pretending to be indifferent.

Her attitude was unusually easy to read, she was even showing her teeth as she smiled. However, I think that was something she was directing at Fumiya-kun. I pointed out the place where Ani was standing to Fumiya-kun who was standing next to Ayako-san who had allowed her wall of indifference to break.

Ani was watching us.

“Tatsuya-niisama!”

Fumiya-kun’s face suddenly lit up and he bounded over to Ani’s position.

“Oh well, there′s nothing that can be done.”

While voicing a complaint, Ayako-san headed after Fumiya-kun with swift feet. Indeed, she looked as if she was restraining herself from running.

As he watched those two, Oji-sama made a sour face; he did this every time.





Oji-sama slowly walked after them in a completely different mood than Ayako-san’s. I too trailed after them.

Fumiya-kun was enthusiastically conversing with Ani about something.

Ani made countless small nods, the corners of his mouth rose slightly, showing a small amount of teeth — he smiled?

That person?

Despite never giving a smile like that to me……!

“Hey now, Fumiya, Ayako. You shouldn’t interfere with Tatsuya-kun’s work.”

In order to maintain my insincere smile, I had to grasp my hands strongly to keep my fingers from curling into a fist, and placed a smile so painstakingly constructed to look natural that Oji-sama would not doubt that it reflected my true feelings.

“Thank you for your work. You are so diligent in performing your tasks.”

“There is no need to thank me.”

The Ani that faced Oji-sama was the usual Ani. His face was so devoid of expression that the smile that had been on his face a little while ago seemed like an illusion.

“Aw, Otou-sama. Wouldn’t a moment or two be alright? Miyuki-neesama is our invited guest. Making the arrangements to prevent harm befalling one’s guest is the duty of the host.”

“It’s just as Onee-sama said. The guards of Kuroba are not so unskilled as to allow a single one of our guests to be less than completely safe. Isn’t that right, Otou-san?”

Eh? Fumiya-kun doesn’t address Oji-sama as “Otou-sama”………

By concentrating on such a trivial thing, I was able to distract myself from my mood.

“That is true but……”

Paying my thoughts no mind, Oji-sama spoke ambiguous words while looking bewildered.

I was bewildered as well. However, perhaps, Ayako-san and Fumiya-kun understood Oji-sama’s true intent. Oji-sama did not like his own children — especially Fumiya-kun — directing any friendly interest at Ani.

Fumiya-kun is a candidate who aims to become the next head of the Yotsuba.

Ani is simply the guard of a fellow candidate for the succession, me. Even if we place a special title on them like Guardian, they are servants after all. If I speak cruelly, they are no more than tools to be used and then thrown away.

A tool that, if I can be precise, could not become a candidate for the Yotsuba succession.

Naturally, while Ani is the one who is my guard, since the relationship between Ani and Fumiya-kun is only that of second cousins, there is no real problem with Fumiya-kun adoring Ani. It is the same with Ayako-san. Maya Obaa-sama would probably not be bothered by that.

It sounds harsh when I say it, but Oji-sama is only worried about status. Oji-sama can only see Ani as a servant, a disposable tool. All that means is that the person called Kuroba Mitsugu is probably a “Yotsuba” to the marrow of his bones. Therefore, I feel that I am not mistaken in believing that he feels that having his own children showing empathy for a tool is improper.

That is the natural way of things for a “Yotsuba”.

In order for me to become “Yotsuba Miyuki”, I must have the same mental attitude as Oji-sama.

That he is a Guardian is more important than him being my elder brother.

That person has the position of my guard. If it is necessary, he will exchange his own life in order to fulfill his obligation to protect me as a human shield.

It is only natural for that person who is a tool not to love me; I too, must not yearn for love from that person.

I gave myself these instructions.

Like an incantation, I repeated them over and over.

Ani has the position of my guard.

He is my human shield.

That is the position granted to Ani. I must become the heir of Maya Obaa-sama, therefore Ani is not my Onii-sama—

I stiffened due to a pain in the core of my brain.

For an instant, I felt as if I had no idea where I was.

Of course that was an illusion. I am at Kuroba Oji-sama’s party that I was invited to; in front of me, Oji-sama is making a discomfited face.

……Somehow I feel like I was thinking about something really important, however…that’s probably just my imagination.

“…Fumiya, do not trouble your honored father so much.”

Unexpectedly, the one who tossed Oji-sama a lifeline was Ani.

He called Fumiya-kun, “Fumiya”.

In an affectionate tone as if Fumiya-kun really was his younger brother.

Deep inside my mind, I felt a faint pain.

Without thinking, my face started to scowl in discomfort.

I must not.

If I show displeasure on my face now, it will be misinterpreted as disapproval of Ani and Oji-sama’s interaction.

……I wonder if that would be a misinterpretation………?

No, No, if I think about that!

Uumm, what can I do at a time like this?

Before I left, Sakurai-san told me what to do.

That’s right, I need to skillfully deceive my own feelings—

“Kuroba-san, it is all right to entrust the party site to you? I myself wish to take a little look around outside.”

“Oh, really? That is a splendid idea.”

Oji-sama showed tremendous surprise at Ani’s suggestion, and even calculatingly praised Ani for it.

“Understood. I will look after Miyuki-chan. This place is under my supervision so I will accept responsibility.”

That is probably insincere praise that can be produced at any time.

Since there are diplomatic excuses to get rid of pests, I should use one to rid myself of the biggest one.

A truly convenient false face.

“First you bring you, yourself, in alignment with what you would call your false face.”

—Ani is faithfully performing the duties allotted to him.

“Aw nuts! We are returning to Shizuoka tomorrow! We do not often get a chance to see each other, and we don’t even get a chance to spend a lot of time talking.”

“Fumiya, calm down a little……Tatsuya-san, what Fumiya said is true, so please return quickly.”

“Understood. I will take one tour around and then return. So, then Kuroba-san I am going to get a little air.”

—Therefore I too, must perform the duties allotted to me with all my strength.

While I listened to Ani replying to Fumiya-kun’s protests and Ayako-san’s requests in a gentle voice, I instructed myself thus.





Chapter 5




November 6th, AD 2095 / Yotsuba Main House - Reception Room

——Hee-hee—

At the sudden sound of Miyuki’s giggling voice, Tatsuya, who had been looking out the window, turned his eyes to the interior of the room.

In contrast to the eastern style of the architecture, the big room was done in western style. There were even paintings of landscapes adorning the brightly hued walls, not reproductions either; according to the signatures of the celebrated modern artists on the canvases, these were original oil paintings. And the stately natural wood table was of a size that could easily seat over ten people.

Nonetheless, this room gave an impression of emptiness. This was possibly due to the fact that, instead of the space being occupied by the legs of over ten chairs, there was only the four legs of a sofa placed by the table; also, aside from the table and sofa, there were almost no furnishings, which appeared to leave all too much space leftover in the room. Making the room feel unnecessarily vast was probably for the purpose of psychologically inducing a feeling of oppression.

Naturally, such things had been beneath Tatsuya’s notice for a long time now. His gaze went straight to his younger sister.

Upon receiving his puzzled look, Miyuki, who was seated on the sofa with the carved ball and claw legs, bashfully ducked her head.

“……Pardon me, Onii-sama. I was merely remembering something that happened in the past.”

“Something amusing?”

Tatsuya also smiled in response to the smile on Miyuki’s face when she answered.

“No…… I was so foolish in the past, I found that humorous.”

Tatsuya’s smile vanished, a feat that occurred in the blink of an eye in response to the thoughtless self depreciating remark. But he was unable to find anything negative in the content of the words, the tone of the voice, or the expression on her face.

“Come to think of it, Onii-sama back then was kind to Ayako-san and Fumiya-kun…… I was quite shocked by that?”

From what she said, Tatsuya formed an impression of the general period Miyuki was remembering and broke out a smile.

“Well…I was just a child back then, give me a break.”

“That is absurd. I am the one who was a foolish child.”

The two of them were still at an age where the world could still call them “children”. And the siblings themselves also didn’t think of themselves as adults.

Despite that, the two of them experienced no feelings of inconsistency or hesitation when they labeled the people they had been three years prior as mere “children”.

“Back then, even though I am your sister, I did not understand one thing about Onii-sama. No…I did not even want to understand you.”

Tatsuya wanted to say something to refute that, but aside from a brief smile bestowed on the bowed head of his sister, unfortunately he had no other response to give.

Even if he could refute her words, it was not necessary to do so.

Although both of them had been wrong, neither of them were responsible; Tatsuya and Miyuki were both aware of this.

If Miyuki was no longer in the mood to continue speaking of the past, Tatsuya was not going to bring it up again.

Tatsuya returned his gaze to the window.

While appearing to blankly gaze outside, his five senses were fully operational, looking for signs of unusual activity and missing nothing. His extra sense perceived more than his five senses, so he was always ready to access the information dimension at a moment’s notice.

This was all for the sake of protecting Miyuki.

If something came into existence that looked like it would harm Miyuki, Tatsuya would destroy it first to prevent that.

This had not changed between now and back then.

But back then, she had been unaware of it.

But back then, she had been kept from being aware of it by him.





Chapter 6




August 5th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Villa ~ Coast of Onna

Last night had continued until considerably late. Arriving at Okinawa then having a party until near midnight made for a pretty tough first day.

Yet, even so, for me to wake before the sun had risen, could only be explained as habit.

Truth be told, I had wanted to sleep a little longer, but I didn’t want to turn into a loose lady. Falling asleep again would be unthinkable. With effort, I sent energy to my limbs, got off the bed and drew back the curtains, opening the window to let in some fresh air while I was at it. Since I’m on the second floor facing the backyard, there was no worry about being seen in my pajamas from the outside. ……Although taking care of my appearance first really would have been more fitting of a lady’s etiquette.

Sniffing the sea breeze I inhaled deeply, swelling my chest out.

And at the moment I looked down, there was my brother training.

Crouched down low, he’d take a step with the right foot, thrust out his right arm, thrust out his left arm.

Then in that position he’d take a step with the left foot, and just as I thought he’d thrust out his left arm again he rapidly pulled it back, and as if intersecting, thrust out his right arm.

Turning his body as he progressively took steps with the left foot and right foot, his right arm would forcefully move from inside to outside, left arm from outside to inside, right hand up, left hand down.

It seemed like some sort of martial arts or karate I didn’t know.

In each hand he held a small - one kilogram - weight, with which he went through motions with great precision. They were as vivid as the set poses used by lead dancers or stage actors.

Making his way in a circle around the fringe of half the backyard, my brother finally stopped moving, exhaling deeply and relaxing.

-Eh, it’s over……?

I stared with bad grace at my brother’s back as he took a deep breath, willing him to show me that beautiful “dance” again.

Let me see more.

Just once is fine.

That amazing form of yours, to your little sister……

—Wait!

I regained myself.

—No way, I had been entranced?

I closed the curtains in a rush, then hurried from the window.

The curtain rails made a pretty big noise, but it wouldn’t be audible from the yard…… I think.

I leaned against the wall and collapsed down.

My face was hot.

My heart was pounding away furiously and wouldn’t calm down even as I held my hands against my chest.

—He hadn’t realized, right?

My brother hadn’t looked up even once.

He shouldn’t have seen me standing at the window.

Yet despite that, as I had stood staring as if enchanted, I had the feeling that my brother had noticed me too.




As always, my breakfast was provided by Sakurai-san. This villa also technically had an automatic cooking machine managed by a HAR, but Sakurai-san herself had insisted that “those who rely on automatic machines become insipid” and as such, all her meals were homemade unless under extraordinary circumstances.

Recently, I had taken a hand in helping too, but truth be told, my skills are still very much in the “getting there” stage.

“Do you have any plans for today?”

As I sipped tea after the meal, Sakurai-san asked that question. In form that would have been addressed to Okaa-sama, but I knew full well it applied to me too.

“If the heat lets up, I’d like to go out to sea.”

Thinking a little, Okaa-sama gave her reply.

“Shall I ready the cruiser?”

“Hmm…… a smaller sailing yacht would be nice.”

“Understood. Is 4 PM alright?”

“Yes, please.”

With experience, Sakurai-san smoothly inferred the specifics from Okaa-sama’s brief words and deduced her intentions, efficiently assembling a schedule.

This means my timetable for past 4 PM has been decided as well. Okaa-sama most likely intends to spend the time until then inside the villa.

Now, what shall I do?

“Miyuki-san, if you have no particular plans, how about going to the beach? Even if you just lie down, I think it’d be a good way to refresh yourself.”

Seeing me lost in thought, Sakurai-san made a suggestion.

“……I guess so. Then, I suppose I’ll just relax on the beach in the afternoon.”

“I’ll help you prepare. Ufufu, if you’re wearing a swimsuit then you’ll need to carefully apply sunscreen to each and every little part of your body.”

……Eh? “Ufufu”, that’s……

“……No, thank you. I can do it by myself.”

“Now now, there’s no need to refrain.”

……Sakurai-san strangely seems to be anticipating something.

“The sunlight here in the tropics is intense. If you leave a gap somewhere, it’ll be terrible.”

……Sakurai-san, that look in your eyes is very suspicious.

“Naturally we’d have to cover all the bits under the swimsuit too. Ufufufu……”

“Uh, uhmm, Sakurai-san?”

Sakurai-san, for some reason, you look really scary right now!

“Come on, let’s go get ready.”

I attempted to slip away in silence, but before I could move an inch, Sakurai-san had her hand around my wrist.

Her grip wasn’t so tight as to be painful, but there was definitely no shaking her off.

I was dragged like that up to the second floor, and when I glimpsed at my brother, I had the distinct feeling he was laughing underneath his expressionless face.

……Even though he’s not supposed to have any such human feelings.




Under Sakurai-san’s hands, sun cream really was rubbed very thoroughly over every inch of my body, and by the time I stumbled out from the villa to the beach, I was limp all over.

“……Why do I have to be so tired over this?” I complained unreasonably to myself.

In any case, I assumed what I considered a modest easygoing posture, took off my tunic, then went under the parasol my brother had set up and on top of the sheet my brother had prepared and laid down.

The separated swimsuit I wore wasn’t quite as far gone as a bikini, but still possessed quite a fair amount of exposure. It wasn’t something I would have chosen, but then again Sakurai-san hadn’t exactly given me much of a choice.

That’s what I thought anyway, but at the sight of me, my brother wasn’t moving an inch. Wearing knee-length trunks under a parka, he was seated next to me with his eyes on the horizon.

Knees slightly bent, looking as if spacing out.

When I stole a glance over, it was as if he wasn’t even aware of me, simply staring into the distance. I wonder if he’s bored?

He’s a healthy, fit boy in his first year at junior high, but with the sea right in front of him, all he did was sit. That was it.

Is this normal? Driven by that question, I moved myself with my elbows, and sneaked a glance at the other parasols dotted around.

That’s a…… family I think. A mother and father, and a girl probably in her first or second year of primary school.

Just as I thought so, a boy slightly older than the girl came running up from the beach.

The boy took his father’s hand, and seemed as if trying to pull him over to the sea.

The parasol next to theirs was vacant. There were various belongings indicating the presence of two people. ……There are two parkas, which means two people right?

Those two were probably down by the sea as well.

Beyond that was…… whoawhoawhoa!

I put my head down in a hurry.

After attempting another peek, I was forced to lower my head again almost immediately.

There, a guy around senior high— I don’t think he was a university student yet— was rubbing oil over a girl.

In some pretty dangerous areas too. Hey, is he going for full body coverage?

And in such an openly public place at that, aren’t, aren’t they embarrassed at all?

The guy at least didn’t have to worry about being seen. Stroking away at the girl’s body, he was laughing quite happily. It wasn’t a very pleasant expression to see.

Do guys like doing that sort of thing?





A more outgoing woman would laugh— Sakurai-san definitely would laugh, but I had read in a magazine somewhere that men like touching women. I’ve also heard from friends at school that when “advanced” senpais go out on a date, they have trouble with their boyfriends seeking after their body. Just what do they think girls are, I indignantly felt at the time. That terrible age of “free sex” ended half a century ago! Besides which, you’re doing those things to a junior high student!

……Not good, not good. Calm down. I can’t go causing a frost on the beach in Okinawa in the middle of summer.

But, the woman didn’t seem to be against it.

It might just be because she’s lying down prone the same as me and not readily visible, but since the guy is being allowed to go right ahead I’m guessing she’s okay with it.

……The same as me?

Here’s me lying down, and there’s that person sitting next to me.

I wonder, is he thinking something similar? Is he capable of such a thing?

I craned my neck slightly, looking again at my brother’s face, and my brother was looking at me.

Our eyes met.

In contrast to me who was frozen still, he simply continued to look around for two, three seconds, before turning back to face the horizon.

I regained control of my body with difficulty and, unable to say anything, simply hid my now heated face with my arm.

I thought about undoing my hair and using it as a curtain of sorts, but could see it becoming troublesome eventually.

Lying prone, I could do nothing but wait for my cheeks to cool down.

With my view obscured so, my - now back to normal - head began to fill with all sorts of thoughts I really shouldn’t have been thinking about.

He, just when had he begun looking at me?

What part of me was he looking at?

My back? Legs? Or……

I wonder, does this person have the same interests? Was he thinking he’d like to touch my body, or something……?

I knew I really shouldn’t be thinking such things about my blood-related sibling. But my brother and I weren’t quite that straightforward.

Even though we live in the same house, we rarely see each other.

The only times we’re together, including to and from school, is when we’re out. Being together during the day like now only happens during trips.

For as far back as I can remember, I have no memories of taking baths together, playing together, or anything at all.

To me, my brother is not so much family, but rather more like a one year older boy I know. Those are my true feelings.

It’s probably the same for him.

For him, I’m most likely just someone attending the same school, a one year younger girl……

Unexpectedly, I heard the sound of sand shifting.

I knew it must have been my brother getting up.

I couldn’t raise my head.

Rather, my face simply sank further down into my arm which was serving as a pillow.

I tried willing strength into my arms, legs, and back, and found out my body had other ideas.

Inside my stiff body, my heart violently pounded away.

I sensed my brother looming over me.

I couldn’t breathe.

My head was in a daze.

It’s too early for that to be because of oxygen deprivation, a rational part of my mind calmly and uselessly told me.

My body, which simply refused all instruction to move, was softly covered by a thin cloth.

—Eh?

I could feel the fabric, stretching from my shoulders to my thighs.

It was the tunic I had taken off earlier.

That suitably folded tunic, was now spread over my body.

Somehow, suddenly, I felt a sense of security.

All my meaningless tension disappeared, and perhaps as a consequence my mind began to drift instead.

Without allowing myself any further self-analysis, I felt myself lulled into a comfortable sense of drowsiness.



In the end, I really do have to be thankful to Sakurai-san. Despite the fact I was under a parasol, I had slept in that fierce sunlight for quite a while. If I hadn’t been guarded by sunscreen all the way up to my nails, my bare legs would no doubt be suffering terrible burns by now.

“So hot……”

As I blamed the interruption to my sleep on the relentless heat, my brother was, as expected, still next to me watching the horizon.

“……How long have I slept?”

“Around two hours.”

I asked a question without warning.

And yet, he answered without a moment’s hesitation.

Almost as if to head off any other questions.

The answer felt rushed, like he didn’t want to give me time to think.

“I see.”

I vaguely felt that something was up, but my head was still fuzzy from having just awoken, and I wasn’t able to put a finger on that sense of discomfort.

As I got up, my tunic slipped off onto the sheet.

Perhaps because of the sea breeze blowing sand everywhere, despite the fact I had slept on a sheet, the surface under my limbs felt a little rough.

“I’m going into the water.”

Without waiting for a reply, I hooked on my sandals.

All around the sheet, numerous footprints were evident. They hadn’t been there before. Some parts had been flattened, resembling the backs of people who had fallen over. Perhaps some people had been playing beach volleyball……?

The number of surrounding parasols had decreased as well.

It seems a lot had happened while I was asleep, I thought lazily, as I headed down to the beach.




After a late lunch, I spent some time reading in my room. However, after two hours I became bored. It’s not that I dislike reading, I simply didn’t really feel like it today.

I guess I’ll go show Okaa-sama my magic practice.

Thinking that, I went to her room.

My room is in the very middle of the 2nd floor.

Okaa-sama’s room is across from the stairs, on the other side.

The room opposite mine is empty, and the one next to the stairs belongs to my brother.

Passing by it, I heard a voice from inside.

Without thinking, I paused.

This resort is pretty standard, meaning that unlike our home, it’s not fully soundproofed; yet despite that, it’s not so cheap that normal voices could be heard from the hallway. For them to be audible, they must be speaking very loudly.

Not to mention that that voice just now, was Sakurai-san’s? Instinctively, I pressed my ear to the door.

“How could you leave a terrible blow like this without treatment!”

Sakurai-san was probably scolding my brother.

“It’s nothing major. There is no compromising damage to the bone.”

“Don’t act as if everything’s fine as long as nothing’s broken! Doesn’t it hurt!?”

“There is pain. However, it’s nothing more than a penalty I have set upon myself.”

Pain?

Penalty?

—What are they talking about?

“Haa…… you’re always like this…… Tatsuya-kun, I’ve already given up trying to correct that mentality of yours but……

At least let me heal you up with magic, so take off your clothes please.”

Always?

“There is no need. If it becomes a hindrance in combat, it will repair itself.”

“……Tatsuya-kun, even Guardians have a day to day life. Because we aren’t merely fighting machines. Speaking of which, about that incident, it would have been better for you to simply wake Miyuki-san and leave. As Guardians, though we should respect our charge’s will and freedom to the utmost, that’s no reason to get into a fight just because you don’t want to interfere with a nap.”

……Eh? Me?

“I am regretful.”

“Seriously, please think this incident over alright? Running is also a perfectly respectable tactic. Tatsuya-kun, you need to learn to be more flexible.”

I didn’t hear the sound of a sigh, but rather sensed that Sakurai-san had done so as she sagged her shoulders and prepared to leave.

In a hurry, as quietly as I could, I went back to my room.




The cruiser Sakurai-san had prepared was a six-seater sailing ship with an electric motor attached.

The four of us along with the helmsman and his assistant filled the boat to full capacity.

I sat awaiting departure on seats arranged face to face. Directly across from me is Okaa-sama, and next to me is my brother.

Pretending to watch the sails being set up, I shot a glimpse at my brother’s profile.

He was intent upon their work, and didn’t notice my gaze.

Ever since I had overheard their conversation, I couldn’t help thinking about it.

My brother is my escort.

Getting injured in the course of protecting me is to be expected.

But up until now, I have rarely ever seen my brother injured.

Direct confrontation like yesterday’s are also rare.

Speaking of his injuries, they had all been from training.

Which was why I, despite being a successor candidate to the Yotsuba, had always naively assumed that there were very few humans who would be despicable enough to pick on us children.

Such a thing may be so in novels, but reality is different.

At Fumiya-kun’s place, unlike the Yotsuba, Ojisama’s work seemed to be more out of convenience.

The “Guardian” attached to me is iconically associated with a successor candidate of the Yotsuba.

Therefore a part of me had always thought that for a child like my brother to be assigned as a Guardian had been for the sake of giving my magically-lacking brother a place in the Yotsuba. And another part has always felt guilty for doing so.

But from the conversation those two had earlier, injuries seem to be something par for the course.

“Miyuki-san, is something bothering you?”

“Ah, no, it’s nothing.”

At that unexpected voice, I turned around in a hurry.

Not good, not good.

I made Okaa-sama worry.

“It’s been a while since I’ve gone sailing……”

“Ah, that’s right.”

Pretending to watch the sails being set up seems to have worked out.

But that won’t put them off indefinitely, and I decide to shelve my thoughts for now.

Just in time, it seems we’re about to depart.

Despite the fact that we’re not using the motor, we drew away from the pier at a greater speed than I expected.

I focused my thoughts on the flowing scenery.



In the face of a westerly wind, we were headed in a north-northwest direction.

Since I had assumed that in summer along Okinawa, a southeasterly wind should be blowing, I asked the captain about it, to which he replied that a low pressure area was approaching from the Eastern sea.

I was also told that it wouldn’t grow into a typhoon, so I shouldn’t be concerned.

I hadn’t even been aware of that, so my worries did go up…… but it’s not like I’ve been at sea for any long period of time, so it’s probably just a needless anxiety.

Although we were sailing towards Iejima, the point of the trip itself was sailing so we had planned to turn back halfway. With the current wind speed though, by the time we were halfway it’d be dusk already.

Sailing is more comfortable than I had anticipated.

It felt like my confused heart was being swept away by the wind.

If I had known, I would have liked to leave earlier and go further.

I closed my eyes, and for a while simply listened to the sound of the wind in the sails.

If we can end the day like this, I should be able to sleep very comfortably tonight.

—Should, because I knew that this couldn’t last.



Upon feeling a particularly sharp wind, I opened my eyes.

Sakurai-san was looking sternly out to sea, or rather, glaring.

The words the assistant uttered as he desperately appealed into the radio — submarine? In this situation, I don’t think it’s the Navy. Could it possibly be foreign? These are Japanese territorial waters though. Don’t tell me…… an act of aggression!?

It wasn’t only me starting to fret. As if the ship itself had pushed the panic button, the motor squeaked as it started up and the sails were stowed.

As the rudder swung round the cruiser tilted, and I grabbed on to the rail.

“Ojou-sama, please go to the front.”

Although I knew this wasn’t a good time, my brother calling me “Ojou-sama” all of a sudden was a pretty big shock.

It’s something that happens often, but to be called in such a way as if I were a stranger saddened me.

In response, my attitude unnecessarily hardened.

“I know!”

With that utterly uncalled for and meaninglessly high pressured line, I complied and left my seat.

I observed the foaming sea.

Although my brother had his back to me and I couldn’t see his face, I just knew what sort of eyes he was making just as sure as if I had taken his hand.

Neither glaring, nor staring.

—Simply expressionless and empty, those eyes of the void.

Sakurai-san stood on the stern side, protecting Okaa-sama.

Okaa-sama is an exceptionally powerful magician, but her strength has been down because of it recently. The interactions between magic and the body is still not fully understood, but it is known that using powerful magic has a proportional strain on the body.

She mustn’t be allowed to use magic.

Reaching that thought, I took my CAD out from my pouch in a hurry.

Sakurai-san already had her CAD on standby.

And my brother was—empty handed, just standing there.

From behind our wake, two black shadows rapidly approached in our direction.

Dolphins? Like hell they were!

I could identify those intuitively.

Torpedoes!? Without any warning whatsoever!?

As I was frozen, my brother standing in front of me made an inexplicable gesture. He raised his right hand out to sea, at those looming black shadows.



Without a CAD, you do know there’s no meaning in making the motions right?

Even if only in the least, you’re still a magician right!?

I was cursing inside. Not only irritation at my brother imitating the gestures without knowing their true purpose, but irritation at his powerlessness as well.

With those thoughts in my mind, I looked up at Sakurai-san. As Okaa-sama’s Guardian, surely she would do something in place of my brother’s uselessness, and berate him for his escapism.

But I was off.

Faster than Sakurai-san could activate anything, my brother, like a flash of thunder in the clouds, unleashed magic.

It was over so fast, I didn’t even realize it was a sign magic had been invoked for a moment.

Both the torpedoes sank towards the bottom of the sea.

As they sank, the shadows expanded. The torpedoes had disintegrated?



Just what had this person done……?

Without a magical aid or anything……?

As doubt and denial warred in my mind, the magician inside me told me this phenomena was without a doubt caused by my brother, who had used an unbelievably advanced magic to interfere with the information structure of the torpedoes and achieve an extreme state of decomposition.

This person, who, apart from the ability to neutralize another’s magic, should not have any magical ability himself, had……?

Could it be that I don’t actually know the least bit about this brother of mine?

I didn’t actually understand anything about him at all?



As Sakurai-san continued to work magic under the water, I simply stared at my brother’s back, reverted to the child he seemingly appeared to be on the outside.





Chapter 7




November 6th, AD 2095 / Yotsuba Main House - Drawing room

Tatsuya, who had been looking out the window until now, suddenly looked over at the doorway.

While the house seemed like a traditional Japanese house on the outside, the inside was an unscrupulous compromise between east and west. An appropriate description may be a Japanese-Western style mansion. The rooms were either purely Japanese or purely Western.

This drawing room—the “audience hall”, was Western style. The wallpaper, ceiling, floor and windows, along with the lighting and furniture were all Western.

The doorway had a wooden door.

As Tatsuya stared, a knocking noise sounded from that door.

Miyuki said “come in” while still seated on the sofa, and a voice replied “excuse me” as the door opened. Wearing an apron over a kimono, a “maid” appeared. ……According to the image of the house, perhaps “meido” would have been more appropriate, but it was difficult to get past that anachronistic impression.

That “maid” bowed deeply, before standing aside.

A man wearing a suit stood behind her.

That man was someone Tatsuya knew very well.

Miyuki covered her mouth with a hand. It seemed to have dropped open of its own accord.

While not to the same extent as Tatsuya, Miyuki also tentatively knew this man.

As the man entered the room the maid bowed again, before leaving and closing the door without any explanation. It seems that she had only been a guide.

“It’s been while, Tatsuya. Well, actually I guess it’s only been a week.”

“Major…… why are, no, you were called by our aunt, right?”

Asking for a reason, Tatsuya swapped the “question” for a “statement” halfway through. There’s no reason for Kazama to visit the Yotsuba, so conversely, it was obvious the reason he was here was because he had been called.

“That is correct. However, I had not heard that you’d be attending as well.”

“……I am sorry.”

The one who had apologized was Miyuki, who had stood up the moment Kazama entered the room.

Kazama had simply been stating a fact. He was not small-minded enough to be upset over such a trivial matter.

Knowing that Tatsuya had simply shrugged, but Miyuki could not so easily put aside the bungling of her relatives.

“It is not something to be concerned over.”

Kazama and Miyuki did not have much correspondence.

In fact, they had never met without Tatsuya also being present.

Which was why Kazama, in the presence of a third party, was not quite as frank with Miyuki as he would normally be with Tatsuya. Nevertheless, being in Tatsuya’s presence all the time, he couldn’t help but think of her as simply “Tatsuya’s little sister”.

Still, while the number of times they have met is not as much, she had first met him at the same time as Tatsuya.

Their acquaintance with Kazama sprung from the events of three years ago.





Chapter 8




August 5th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Villa

By the time the Coast Guard of the Defense Forces rushed over, the submarine had disappeared.

Sakurai-san was fuming at how utterly outrageous it was that they hadn’t noticed it entering our territorial waters, but to be honest, I wasn’t as interested.

Rather than assigning blame, I simply wanted some rest.

Not so much for physical fatigue, but mental exhaustion.

We were asked by the person in charge of the Coast Guard that they’d like a summary of the incident, but I wasn’t in the mood at the time. Not just me, but both Okaa-sama and Sakurai-san also felt the same. We told him that if there was anything in particular they wanted, they could come visit, and we returned to the villa.

Right now, I’m lying in my room.

I had taken a shower, but my head was still unclear.

What lingered in my mind like storm clouds in the rainy season, was the magic my brother had shown. If I wasn’t mistaken, he had directly modified the information structure of the objects and decomposed them.

But as I recall, directly interfering with information structures is classified as amongst the highest rank of difficulty in magic. Never-mind me, it’s possible even Okaa-sama or Aunt wouldn’t be able to do it.

And yet that person, without even using a CAD……

That person, hadn’t he been removed as a successor candidate because he lacked magical talent?

Wasn’t it because he couldn’t use magic that he was assigned as my escort instead?

As long as I can remember, as well as from what I’ve been told, aside from the non-systematic anti-magic “Gram Dispersion”, I have never seen him use any high level magic.

Because he was unable to use the systematic magic of mainstream modern magic adequately, he took advantage of his high physical skill and his specific anti-magic ability to achieve a place in the Yotsuba—that was supposedly the reason my brother was my Guardian.

I don’t get it.

I don’t get it at all.

We’re family, siblings, and yet I know nothing whatsoever.

Even the fact that I know nothing, I didn’t realize until today.

I was appalled.

Come to think of it, this is the first real trip I’ve had since starting junior high.

I wonder, was yesterday the first time he had escorted me alone in the truest sense of the term?

I was six, and he was seven.

That was the age from which my brother became my escort, and I was to be escorted by him.

In the six years since, my brother has always been my escort.

But there’s no way that you’d fully entrust the protection of one who may be the target of kidnap and assault to a primary school kid.

I see, so that’s why I didn’t know that person’s true worth, his real capabilities……

Then, who could I ask to know who that person truly is? Who really knows him?

Okaa-sama? Sakurai-san? Or maybe Aunt?

Just as I found a clue to escaping the maze of my thoughts, or so I thought, a knock came from the door.

Caught off guard, I got off the bed in a hurry, and as I combed my hair, I asked what it was.

“I’m sorry to disturb your rest. The military is here, and would like to hear about the event……”

Sakurai-san’s hesitant voice came from the other side of the door.

“From me?”

As I opened the door, I asked back. It wasn’t terribly respectful, I knew as I spoke, but I really was quite surprised.

“Yes…… I told them that Tatsuya-kun and I could answer any questions they might have, but……”

Sakurai’s expression was very apologetic, even though it wasn’t her fault……

If she acts like that, I’m the one who’s going to be in pain.

“I understand. Are they in the living room?”

Seeing Sakurai-san’s nod, I told her that I’d get changed then be right down.



The soldier who came to talk with us identified himself as Captain Kazama Harunobu.

After finishing his introduction, he went straight to the point.

“……So, did you discover the submarine by chance?”

“The one who discovered the submarine had been the boat captain. If you’d like to know the circumstances concerning that, you should talk with him.”

“Did you notice any characteristics that could identify its registry?”

“It was submerged throughout. Making out specifics was impossible. Even if it had surfaced, I don’t know much about submarines.”

The questions and answers were exchanged between the Captain and Sakurai-san.

Okaa-sama seemed content to leave everything to Sakurai-san, and since I hadn’t been very composed at the time, even if I were inclined to speak, there wasn’t much that I could add.

“Apparently, torpedoes were fired? Do you have any idea why they attacked?”

“None whatsoever!”

Sakurai-san seemed quite irritated. She had been dissatisfied with the response of the military from the start, and at the implied “You guys probably did something to provoke them right?” question which made even me feel slightly chagrined, it was no wonder she’d become angry.

“—I think you’re missing something.”

Still being glared at by Sakurai-san, the Captain turned to face my brother. It was probably simply an act, without any deeper meaning behind it. A new venture, in order to soften the clashing atmosphere between these two.

“In order to leave no witnesses, it is possible to infer that perhaps they were trying to abduct us.”

My brother’s answer however, went far beyond simply clearing up any discontent.

“Abduct?”

The Captain made an expression of surprise; yet intrigued at the same time, he urged my brother to explain further.

“The torpedoes fired at our cruiser were foam torpedoes.”

“Oh……?”

Foam torpedoes?…… Foam producing torpedoes, I guess? Meaning that they produce bubbles……?

“Foam torpedoes? What are those?”

Just as I turned my head, Sakurai-san asked my brother in my place.

The reason she didn’t ask the Captain was probably because she still wasn’t fully over it yet.

“The torpedo warhead is filled with chemicals designed to produce large quantities of foam in a sustained reaction. In that froth-filled water, propellers would be useless. A ship with a high center of gravity like our sailing ship would likely be overturned as well. In doing so, the target is trapped, and the crew can be captured under the disguise of an accident.”

“Why do you think so?”

The Captain was looking at my brother with great interest.

I was simply surprised that he knew such things.

“The cruiser’s communications had been jammed. Doing so is always mandatory if attempting to fake an accident.”

Noticing our communications were disabled in a situation like that, surprised me even further.

“……Sorry, but deducing their armament based on that alone, is rather weak in my opinion.”

“Naturally, I didn’t judge based on just that.”

“You have further evidence?”

“Yes.”

“That is?”





“I refuse to answer.”

“……”

Being told that without any hesitation whatsoever, the Captain couldn’t seem to find anything to say.

Well, Sakurai-san and I were speechless as well.

“Do you need evidence?”

“……No, that won’t be necessary.”

At my brother’s relentless pace, the Captain seemed to be slightly at a loss.

“Captain, could we end soon? I don’t think there’s anything further we can say that would be of help.”

Okaa-sama, who had until now, remained silent save to introduce herself earlier, suddenly spoke in a bored tone.

A bored, yet hard to resist tone.

The Captain immediately recognised that air of dismissal.

“Fair enough. Thank you for your cooperation.”

Saying so, the Captain rose and saluted.



My brother and I saw the Captain and his subordinates out.

A car was parked outside, and next to it, two well conditioned soldiers stood to attention.

One of them, upon seeing my brother, widened his eyes in surprise.

I also remembered him. He was the bad soldier from yesterday, one of the “Left Blood’s”--

“I see.”

Seeing the look of astonishment in the soldier, Captain Kazama nodded in understanding.

“You’re the boy who took down Joe?”

At the Captain’s words, I reflexively went on the defensive.

However looking at the Captain as he laughed merrily, it didn’t seem like he held any tension whatsoever. My brother hadn’t reacted at all.

“Mastering the technique of Inner Striking[11] at such a young age, you’re quite the genius.”

Despite being scrutinized from head to toe, my brother didn’t show a hint of unwillingness at all. But what is this “inner strike”?

It’s a very advanced sounding term……

“Lance Corporal Higaki!”

Having his name shouted out in such a loud voice, the bad soldier from yesterday trembled and winced.

Under the Captain’s strong gaze, he ran up before him.

The Captain glanced at the man as he saluted and stood to attention.

Then he turned to face my brother, and bowed.

“My subordinate acted very rudely to you yesterday. I give my apologies.”

At this utterly unexpected sight, I was completely lost for words.

With his arms folded behind his back, legs apart and head slightly inclined, it was a rather sloppy bow from the view of public courtesy, but for a rugged soldier like the Captain to apologize so gracefully to a child like my brother was too overwhelming.

“I am Lance Corporal Higaki Joseph! For my unbecoming conduct yesterday, I am very sorry!”

Following up the Captain, completely different from yesterday, Lance Corporal Higaki tensely uttered those words as he in contrast bowed deeply.

It seems he wasn’t really a bad guy.

Furthermore, he seemed to be pretty terrified of the Captain.

“—I accept your apology.”

In the space of a breath, my brother answered.

“Thank you very much!”

I also had no objection.

I hadn’t intended to speak in the first place.

Followed by Lance Corporal Higaki, Captain Kazama proceeded to the large open topped car, then stopped three steps away and looked back.

“Shiba Tatsuya-kun, was it? At the moment, I’m serving as the instructor of an airborne magician squad at Onna base. If you’re free, come visit us sometime. I’m sure you’ll find something of interest.”

Captain Kazama spoke those parting words and, without waiting for a reply, climbed into the car.





Chapter 9




August 6th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Villa ~ Onna Air Force Base

On the morning of the third day of our vacation, a storm began to brew.

The skies were overcast, and strong winds blew.

It seems a tropical storm was approaching from the Eastern sea.

Apparently by the time it blows up here it won’t have the strength of a typhoon, but from the looks of it, it would come pretty close.

Every channel was advising it would be best to avoid marine spots, but I don’t think anyone would be in a beach-going mood in this weather anyway. Boats were obviously out of the question.

We would be here for two weeks, so there was no need to overdo anything for just these few days.

“What are your plans for today?”

As she passed freshly baked bread to Okaa-sama, Sakurai-san asked that question.

“In this weather, even shopping would be……”

Tilting her head slightly, Okaa-sama muttered to herself. Making that gesture, she seemed almost like a girl in terms of cuteness. It was just a moment, but she appeared really young.

“What shall we do?”

Being asked in reverse, Sakurai-san also ceased eating and tilted her head.

She also appeared really young, but unlike Okaa-sama, Sakurai-san gave more of an “Onee-san”-like feel…… although of course, Okaa-sama is far older in terms of age.

“Hm……how about going to see a Ryuukyuu dance[10]?”

Saying so, Sakurai-san turned on the wall mounted display.

Deftly operating the handheld remote, she brought up a guide on Ryuukyuu performances.

“It appears you can also try on the costumes yourself.”

“Looks interesting. What do you think, Miyuki-san?”

“I think it also seems pretty nice.”

“I’ll arrange a car. There is one problem however……”

Seeing both Okaa-sama and I nod, Sakurai-san seemed rather somber.

“The performance is for women only.”

Ah, that’s true. It certainly did say that at the bottom of the video.

Then, my brother……

“I see……”

Okaa-sama had ripped her toast into small pieces, and was popping them into her mouth one by one.

“……Tatsuya, you can be free for the day.”

“Yes.”

“You received an invitation to the base from the Captain yesterday right? This would be a good opportunity to visit.

You may be invited to join their training.”

“I understand.”

You can be free, Okaa-sama had said, but she ended up ordering him after all.

Without showing any dissatisfaction whatsoever, my brother simply accepted it with his deadpan expression.

The same as always.

“Um, Okaa-sama!”

Why I did such a thing, I don’t know myself.

“Could I go together with Ni, Nii-san?”

My lips, tongue, and vocal cords ran off and said such a thing. —The reason I stumbled over pronouncing Nii-san was most likely because in my head, I had always been calling him “brother” or “that person” all the time.

It’s not like I was nervous……or anything.

“Miyuki-san?”

I thought it was pretty abrupt myself. As expected, Okaa-sama was shooting me a rather quizzical look.

Uuu, so uncomfortable……!

“I, uhm, I’m also interested in what sort of training magicians in the military go through, and uh, as a Mistress I think I should find out more about the abilities of my Guardian……”

“Is that so……how admirable.”

Saying the word “mistress” required overcoming considerable amounts of resistance.

In any case, I stood there willing Okaa-sama to believe my desperate excuses.

For some reason, I feel rather guilty……

But, I didn’t intend to lie. —Never mind lying or not, I didn’t even know my true feelings.

“Tatsuya, it’s as you heard. You’ll be accompanied by Miyuki-san on your tour of the base.”

“Yes.”

“Just keep one thing in mind. In public, don’t go using honorifics or the like when addressing Miyuki-san. Rather than ‘Ojou-sama’, just ‘Miyuki’ is fine. Actions which could lead to the discovery that Miyuki-san is a Yotsuba Head successor are prohibited.”

“……Understood.”

This time, there was a slight delay before my brother nodded.

It wasn’t just my brother who experienced confusion.

I was in a supreme state of embarrassed bewilderment. The part about the “candidate” went straight over my head, and instead, my mind was filled with scenes where my brother was calling me “Miyuki”.

“Do not misunderstand. This is only expedient for deceiving any observers who may be watching. There is no change in the relationship between you and Miyuki-san.”

At Okaa-sama’s words which brought a sense of discomfort, my brother simply replied “as you command”.




Although we’re on vacation, our hosts were in the middle of work in a national institution. In order to not be rude and decrease exposure, I wore a UV resistant see-through cardigan over a modest short sleeved dress, while my brother wore a short sleeved polo shirt under his summer jacket with ankle length dress pants when we visited Captain Kazama at the base.

“I am Sanada, in the Defense Army Department of Weapons Development.”

The soldier who greeted us when we arrived introduced himself. His rank apparently was Lieutenant. Hearing that, my brother seemed quite surprised.

Why is it……when he’s with other people, he shows such a wide variety of expressions?

“Is something the matter?”

“No……it’s just I didn’t expect to be guided by an officer. Also, I thought that this was an air force base[12].”

Hearing my brother’s words, the corners of Sanada-san’s mouth twitched. It felt like he had warmed up to us a little.

“It seems you have some familiarity with the military, don’t you.”

“My martial arts master was once in the army.”

“Ahh, I see……well, the reason an army technology officer is in an air force base is because my specialty is rather unique, and we’re lacking those here. The reason your guidance isn’t being left to a noncom is……because we were expecting you, I suppose.”

Lieutenant Sanada smiled affably as he spoke. He wasn’t particularly handsome, but his features had a certain charm which would put anyone at ease.

However for some reason my brother seemed to go on guard upon seeing that smile.



Sanada-san led us into a high-ceiling gymnasium. By gymnasium, I refer to the fact that that’s the closest impression I could think of, and it’s possible that it has a different name altogether.

From the ceiling which was probably about five stories hung a large number of ropes, from which many soldiers were climbing up to the ceiling then jumping off. They wore no parachutes. It was doubtful whether a parachute would have done any good at this height, but normally speaking fractures would be the least of their problems.

This technique is Acceleration Systematic Magic - Deceleration, is it……

There were probably around 50 people.

All the soldiers getting on then off the ropes were magicians.

The level of this skill wasn’t particularly high, but it’s extremely unlikely that was all they teach magicians at this base. For so many magicians to be in one regional base……this is truly the frontline border.

I can also see the bad soldier, err, Lance Corporal Higaki.

So that person was a magician……

Captain Kazama was waiting for us. I can understand that he knew we were coming based on him sending Sanada-san to pick us up, but I didn’t think he’d go as far as to leave supervision of training to a subordinate while waiting.

No—he hadn’t been waiting for “us”, but rather, my brother.

“Coming this early, can I interpret this as an interest in the military?”

With a clumsy smile on his rugged face, Captain Kazama spoke to my brother.

“I do have some interest. However, I have not decided on whether I want to become a soldier.”

“Well, that’s to be expected. You’re still a junior high student right?”

His wording different from yesterday, I felt that he had some ulterior motives—although that may be a bit harsh.

“Just recently.”

“You should be around 12, no, 13 right? Though, you’re a pretty cool customer.”

“I am 13.”

At the Captain’s question, my brother gave a safe answer. I couldn’t help feel a sense of surprise, but I immediately put it down to my misplaced beliefs.

My brother was a honor student at school. Not only in primary, but even in the junior high he had just entered, in everything unrelated to magic he was a prodigy all the way.

He couldn’t really be said to be sociable even as flattery, but he’s been relied on in numerous situations by both classmates and juniors, and even once by a teacher.

If he had been born into a family unconnected to magic.

If he hadn’t been the nephew of the Yotsuba family head.

If he wasn’t Okaa-sama’s son.

If he wasn’t my brother.

…There’s no point thinking about this, is there.

It’s the same as thinking, what if I didn’t have “Yotsuba” Miya’s blood in me.

While I was lost in thought, at some point, it was asked if we’d like to participate in the rope climbing training. Obviously not me, but my brother.

“No, I’m not that good at magic.”

Hearing him refer to himself in the first person “I”, my back tingled. Was that a caution from Okaa-sama, to seem normal?

It doesn’t really suit him……no wait, that’s not the point!

“Um, how did you know about Nii-san?”

Again, that strong aversion when attempting to speak the word “Nii-san”.

Why?

When it’s such an indisputable fact that this person is my brother.

“How did you know he was a magician?”

But seizing up in a place like this would be too unnatural.

More than that, this is important to me.

Normally, my brother does not wear a CAD. Of course, he does not carry traditional aids like charms or vájra either.

Both Okaa-sama and I carried mobile terminal CADs, so over these four days, the only one who conspicuously dressed as and could be told to be a magician should be Sakurai-san.

Don’t tell me, we’re being observed……?

“……Just somehow, I guess.”

Captain Kazama seemed to be surprised at being asked a question by me, and with a serious expression gave a decidedly seemingly not serious answer.

Just somehow, the heck’s that?

Is he trying to dodge the question!?

“It’s not like I’m trying to hide anything here.”

—!?

At that timing, almost as if he’d read my mind, my face stiffened.

“Having seen countless hundreds of mages, it’s like I can read the air about them now. Whether they’re magicians or not. Whether they’re strong or weak.”

It’s no good, I thought, I can’t stop the unrest from showing on my expression.

“By the way, why would you ask such a thing?”

This is bad……!

My sensitive reaction had aroused suspicion.

Even though I had been told by Okaa-sama to keep my relationship with the Yotsuba under wraps.

“I’m sorry, my sister has always been sensitive about my poor magic……she’s more nervous than usual.”

—To me who had lost my focus and didn’t know what to do next, my brother became my shield.

“Is that so. You’ve a good sister.”

“Thank you. She is my pride.”

“Haha, you get along so well. I’m jealous.”

I could hear only biting sarcasm in his words..

But my brother had no such intentions.

He had only helped me because I had been in trouble.

I’m not so distorted as to not understand that.

But why was he so concerned?

Even though my struggling for a reply was no concern of his as a Guardian.

Even though keeping the secret of the Yotsuba held no benefit for my brother.

Even though it’d only be me who would be scolded.

So why would he cover me as normal siblings would, as a brother protects his sister……?





Chapter 10




November 6th, AD 2095 / Yotsuba Main House - Drawing room

“Still, a far greater enigma than ever expected.”

In his conversation with Tatsuya, Kazama dropped a line seemingly without context, yet Miyuki picked it up immediately.

“You understood?”

“Just who do you think I am?”

Tatsuya, bowing lightly with a wry smile, expressed his apologies to Kazama.

“I didn’t realise until I had been invited on site……but barring the field hospitals on the front lines, I had seldom sensed the smell of death so densely before.”

At Kazama’s straightforward evaluation, Miyuki involuntarily raised her eyebrows.

At that likely unconscious change in his sister’s expression, Tatsuya thought “no wonder”.

“That’s because this is the site of the infamous ‘Fourth Institute’.”

“The site of the deathly[13] Magic Ability Development Fourth Institute huh……just looking at the building here now, there’s no way to tell.”

During the rise of modern magic, just as in other developed countries, many research and development institutions sprang up dealing with magicians. 10 numbered institutes were set up, and now half of them are still operating. The remaining half, as rights for magicians started to pick up, were closed down one by one for inhumane research amongst other reasons.

Amongst even these was the institute whose research was whispered to have disregarded human life and humanity itself, the Fourth Institute of Magician Development, or the “Fourth Institute”.

Due to the confidentiality surrounding both the Fourth Institute and its research, not even its location had ever been publicly disclosed, only an announcement that it was to be shut down.

The center of the former Fourth Institute was located right in the basement of the Yotsuba main house.

The products of the Fourth Institute, the magicians they developed, were designated only with the number “Four”—the Yotsuba.

Magicians with the letter four in their family name, aside from the Yotsuba, are known to include the “Yomo”, “Shihoudou”, and “Watanuki”. But they are unconnected to the Ten Master Houses and the 18 auxiliary houses.

“All their research facilities are in the basement after all. It’s not just this house, but all the houses of this village were disguised parts of the Fourth Institute’s faculties.”

“So it seems. The first time I knew about it three years ago, I was quite shocked as well.”

“Well, the ground facilities are still used in order to test a magician’s performance, and the martial arts gym especially sees much use…… the smell of death the Major still senses, are most likely now the bodies of the magicians who didn’t make the cut.”

“And so are the Guardians of the Yotsuba tempered, literally side by side with death. I see, so that’s why you people need so little training after joining the military; even the children are formidable.”

The first time Miyuki had heard, she had actually blocked her ears.

Now, she is able to face the truth.

But even now, the pain which runs through her chest hasn’t disappeared.

She will never be able to get used to this pain.

She herself hoped that the day she can simply accept such pain will never come.





Chapter 11




August 6th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Onna Air Force base

Soon after our tour had begun, the rope training ended.

After the rope training was grappling. It may have been of interest to those with an affinity for martial arts, but for someone like me who doesn’t even grasp the difference between kenpo and karate, I got bored rather quickly.

At this rate, with us simply spectating, there’s no way I will be able to grasp my brother’s true abilities.

Maybe I could simply excuse myself early…… nope, no good. I’m not supposed to separate myself from my brother, and even if I did then it defeats the purpose of having come here anyway. Not to mention, it would simply be too rude. It’d be good if it’s somehow possible to get into a situation where that person joins in the training……

There’s no way he could have read my thoughts.

“Shiba-kun, you’re pretty bored just watching aren’t you? Want to have a go?”

With that invitation from Captain Kazama, that person looked over at me.

“I guess so, we came all this way so why not?”

Just now……the fact that I was bored, did he see through me?

Poof, the blood rushed to my head.

How mean, how mean, how meean!

Why did he have to go notice something he totally didn’t need to notice!

—That person didn’t so much as crack a smile, yet here you are having such a childish fit, my inner voice of reason admonished.

But my feelings continued to denounce him.



Ni, Nii-san you idiot, you should at least give me a reason to get mad at you!

Even in my monologue, the uncomfortable sense of resistance at calling him “Nii-san” didn’t completely disappear.

In the first place, truthfully speaking, that term would have been a more appropriate term of address for him, or so it should be.

So just why……?

It seems I still don’t fully understand my own heart.



The partner called up for my brother was a sergeant of medium build looking to be in his late twenties or early thirties.

“Shiba-kun, there’s no need to go easy. Back when he was a student, Sergeant Toguchi’s boxing skills were on the nationals level.”

Even without magic, he was good enough for nationals?

Sliding on his toes without stepping, closing the distance in small increments, his stance felt more like karate than boxing. I wonder if this is Okinawa’s boxing style? Or is it the Air Force’s?

While I was distracted by such speculations, the match was over in an instant.

The time it takes to process thought. In that one moment, my brother struck out with his right arm.

That was an image born from results.

What I really saw was my brother somehow suddenly appearing right next to Sergeant Toguchi, with his right arm extended.

The Sergeant collapsed without a sound onto his knees, somehow spared from falling over any further than that.

“Toguchi!”

One of the watching soldiers ran up in a hurry, and proceeded to administer (I think) first aid to the sweating Sergeant.

Still standing where he was, my brother lightly bowed.

Despite his face showing respect for the opponent he had defeated, it also gave off the impression he was somehow flaunting his victory.

“This, this is……”

Next to me, Captain Kazama was muttering. Lieutenant Sanada was speechless, staring with wide eyes.

“Corporal Haebaru!”

“Sir!”

At the Captain’s call, a well spirited soldier looking to be in his mid 20s stepped forth.

The man was slimmer than the Sergeant, but there was no impression of frailty whatsoever; he had the image of a knife forged through fire and water, hammered and whetted, until everything unneeded was chipped away and all impurities removed: simply sharp.

“Do not even think of holding back. Go with your full power!”

“Yessir!”

Simultaneous with his answer, Corporal Haebaru pounced on my brother.

That’s insane!

There’s no way you can match a soldier who has fought on the frontlines against a 13 year old boy!

Intending to shout out “stop!” I opened my mouth.

But the actual words never came.

Sighs of admiration could be heard coming from here and there from the audience

That person was fending off the Corporal’s onslaught without any hint of being in danger.

Punches and kicks sent out at a speed blurry to the eye, were being intercepted at an even greater speed.

Not by a little, but by quite a bit.

“It’s like he has fought real battles before. That interval is the space you’d allow in case the opponent is holding something back.”

“Seems like it.”

I didn’t understand even half of the conversation between the Captain and the Lieutenant, but even my untrained eyes could perceive that my brother had the upper hand.

There was no room for mistaking the Corporal’s expression.

Even as he attacked, he was desperate.

Ah!

That person counterattacked.

But the Corporal was no slouch either.

After intercepting my brother’s punches right, left, right, left, from the now exposed flank, a counter—!?

I almost involuntarily closed my eyes, but a part of myself calmly told me “there is no need”.

There’s no way that person would be taken out by attacks of this calibre, or such.

The moment it seemed that the Corporal had caught hold of my brother, my brother had already slipped past to the Corporal’s side.

That person’s right hand extended, and grabbed the Corporal’s right sleeve near the top of the elbow.

Yanking the Corporal my brother halted his own motion, at the same time turning Corporal Haebaru around so that his side was exposed.

Without a sound, my brother struck out with his right elbow.

With a groan, the Corporal staggered forwards two, three steps.

The Captain’s shout of “that’s enough!” was the signal to end.



Now receiving treatment, Corporal Haebaru shook hands with that person, as people crowded around them.

As the praise showered down, the Captain cut in admist the throng.

In the gap left in his wake, I followed after the Captain.

“Winning against Corporal Haebaru is quite the feat. He’s one of the strongest in the unit, you know?”

The one who said this was Lieutenant Sanada.

“I truly didn’t expect this degree of skill. Did you receive some form of special training?”

Captain Kazama swept over my brother with discerning eyes.

“No, nothing special in that sense. In terms of my strength, there’s a dojo at our mother’s place, and I train there.”

“Hmm……”

While he didn’t seem completely satisfied, the Captain nodded, appearing to say “I won’t pry any further for now”.

“But at this rate, the honour of the Onna Airborne Corps will be crushed……will you consent to one more match?”

Instead of prying, the Captain said something rather selfish. The one who had invited my brother to participate was the Captain himself. And yet, now that his men had been defeated he went and said something like “losing honour”.

Saying that he must have a match in such a selfish way, just how far is this going to go?

I tried to gently refuse the Captain’s offer.

Since my brother is my escort, I had the right to refuse. I thought that.

“Please, allow me!”

But I was one step too slow.

Interrupting me, a voice I knew called out. It was a voice I had heard recently.

“Lance Corporal Higaki—if this is for the sake of revenge, I will have to refuse you.”

“It is not revenge, it is vindication!”

How is that any different? It’s the exact same thing!

Thinking he wasn’t such a bad guy, was my mistake.

“Humm……well Shiba kun, it’s as you heard, are you willing to have a match with him? Lance Corporal Higaki is still young, but he’s no less experienced than Haebaru.”

Refusing such an offer would by no means be unreasonable. There is no benefit to doing this.

“I accept.”

Despite my thoughts being so, that person went ahead and consented to the Captain.

Lance Corporal Higaki crouched slightly, raised both hands, and looking extremely observant faced that person.

Despite bending over a bit, the Lance Corporal was still taller than my brother.

It looked like a boy was about to be attacked by a bear—that’s what the scene resembled.

Just by looking, it feels like being crushed under pressure.

But that person simply slowly shifted from left to right, balancing on the left foot then the right, watching impassively at his opponent who was waiting for a chance.

That volatile atmosphere under which it was difficult to breath, did not continue for very long.

Lance Corporal Higaki’s body seemed to swell for a moment.

The next instant, the Lance Corporal’s body turned into a cannonball and tore towards my brother.

So fast……!

With a huge leap my brother dodged the charge, but his stance collapsed.

Fast as lightning, the Lance Corporal struck again.

Rolling along the floor, that person somehow managed to dodge the tackle.

I was absolutely stunned at Lance Corporal Higaki’s speed. But there was no way that even this would make a successor candidate to one of the Ten Master Houses, the Yotsuba, show an expression of surprise.

“Using magic, isn’t that utterly cowardly!?”

I lashed out at Captain Kazama.

Not even I had noticed when he turned on the switch to his CAD. It had been well disguised. But the fact that he was using magic itself, was not something which could be hidden.

The Lance Corporal’s speed right now, is being driven by self-acceleration magic!

At my protest, Captain Kazama simply turned his head and looked at me.

The answer came from the direction the Captain was still half turned towards.

“That’s enough, Miyuki!”

My brother’s words, were a double shock to me.



My brother, had given me an order.

My brother, had called me “Miyuki”.



“There had never been a rule that the use of magic was not allowed.”

My brother flatly asserted so.

Addressing me without a title, calling me Miyuki without honorifics, though it was all according to Okaa-sama’s instructions, the decision to reprove me itself was completely my brother’s decision.

My brother, of his own will, rebuked my wishful thinking.

At that, rather than feeling anger or resistance, a strange numb, tingling sensation was born inside my heart.

“Higaki, close in with care!”

Next to me, now that I had fallen silent, Captain Kazama threw out commands.

As if I had just awoken, I noticed.

The air surrounding my brother, had changed color.

It felt like the light was dimming.

It was obviously an illusion.

My brother was exerting such pressure that an onlooker would have their visual field constricted.

My brother changed his stance.

His right palm facing the opponent, he extended his right arm straight out.

His left hand supported his right elbow.

Is this, the position for my brother’s non-systematic magic……?

The muscles of Lance Corporal Higaki’s whole body seemed to swell again.

This time, right at the moment my brother should have dived out of the way with both feet—at that instant.

From my brother’s right hand, a torrent of psions poured forth.





The psion wave swept through Lance Corporal Higaki’s body, and as they did his charge slowed with a snap.

This is……! Gram Demolition!

The raging storm of psion particles forcibly overwhelmed the self-acceleration magic applied to the body, and at the same time shook the connections between the mind and the body. Against a person skilled enough to control his body not through electrical nervous impulses but rather directly through his consciousness, the barrage of external foreign psions wrecked even greater havoc.

It was almost like, Lance Corporal Higaki had forgotten how to tackle.

As the Lance Corporal threw himself defencelessly at my brother, my brother simply moved aside and dealt one blow.

His bulky body, spinning around once, was blown away in an almost comedic fashion.



My brother walked over to the side of Lance Corporal Higaki, sprawled out on the ground looking at the ceiling.

The Lance Corporal simply lay there with his large chest heaving up and down, showing no sign of rising.

Holding out his right hand, my brother was expressionless.

After just a moment’s hesitation, the Lance Corporal took that hand with a grin.

He pulled on my brother’s hand.

Don’t tell me, a trap!?

That was just me thinking too much.

Despite their difference in body weight, Lance Corporal Higaki was able to pull himself up and stand without dragging my brother to the ground.

“—It’s my loss. Utterly. I understand well now that incident the day before yesterday wasn’t just me being caught off guard.”

He wasn’t speaking in such a loud voice, but for some reason I could hear Lance Corporal Higaki’s words clearly.

“Allow me to introduce myself again. I am Lance Corporal Joseph Higaki, Onna Airborne, Sakishima Air Defense Corps, of the National Air Force in Okinawa. Will you tell me your name?”

“I am Shiba Tatsuya.”

“OK, Tatsuya. Just call me Joe. Do you still have a while in Okinawa?

If you’re ever bored, give me a call. Although I may not look like it, I know quite a few people around here.”

“That’s enough, Joe. We’re still in the middle of training.”

Captain Kazama called out while laughing, and reacting as if shocked, Lance Corporal Higaki stood to attention.

Hmm…… so he’s a subordinate who’s treated rather affectionately. I suppose that means he’s trusted……?

Having to change my opinion of this guy over and over is starting to become painful.

In the first place it’s not like he’s someone I’m liable to meet with often, and since he’s someone I’m not likely to see again it shouldn’t really matter to me what kind of guy he is.

“I’m sorry for having asked so much of you. Because of it, it seems like some of my subordinates have had it rather rough as well. Will you accompany us for tea? I’d also like to inquire about that ‘tooate’[14] just now.”

Tooate, is probably referring to my brother’s non-systematic magic.

My feeling of unease went up greatly, but it was impossible to refuse such an invitation in this situation.



“So, that psion wave really was Gram Demolition?”

“Was that really all? I believe there was also some continental Ancient magic, ‘Tendan’ in there as well.”

While technically they had invited us to tea, what was served instead was coffee.

Sitting on one side are my brother and I.

On the other side are Captain Kazama and Lieutenant Sanada.

A coffee break with four people.

Somehow, the atmosphere feels a little strange.

Captain Kazama is talking with my brother.

Lieutenant Sanada is also talking with my brother.

As that person’s little sister, I simply sat in the background as per my instructions.

Here my brother is the protagonist, and I’m just an accessory.

“—From what I’ve seen, Shiba-kun, you don’t carry a CAD around right?”

When they say the name Shiba, they’re referring to my brother. I am “Shiba-kun’s little sister”.

“What are you using as an aid?”

This is my first time experiencing such a thing.

It’s weird, yet not uncomfortable.

“I do use a specialised CAD, but generally speaking it doesn’t really have the right feeling……I’m bad with magic that requires a CAD to cast, after all.”

“Ohh, I see. If you’re so comfortable with manipulating psions like that already though, I don’t see how using CADs could possibly present a problem for you.”

The topic has already shifted from my brother’s non-systematic magic to his CAD.

“Shiba-kun, would you like to try the CAD I’m developing?”

“Lieutenant Sanada develops CADs?”

“My job is the development of magic equipment in general, including CADs. This one in particular is a prototype CAD featuring cartridges as storage.”

I had the sudden feeling that my brother’s eyes were shining. It was a fairly modest reaction in comparison to most people, but for my brother to show so much interest in something was extremely unusual already.

“I would like to.”

This is probably the very first time, I’ve seen him express his desire so clearly.



We were taken to a place I don’t think was in the base, a clean and tidy laboratory.

For me, who had been certain that military bases were all dirty, drab places, I was not quite able to contain my feelings of surprise. The faint smiles Captain Kazama and Lieutenant Sanada wore when they looked over at me was most likely because of that.

My brother looked around in admiration, or impression.

It feels like today, I’m seeing many sides of this person for the first time.

However as much as I had thought that this person was indifferent to everything, even he must have things he’s interested in……



I wonder then, just what does he think of me?

That question, was suddenly floating in my mind.

The answer came automatically.

Desperately, I fought against the shaking which threatened to wrack my body, stiffening myself as much as I could.

“……Miyuki, are you feeling unwell?”

My body, so so close to trembling, suddenly stopped at the sound of my brother’s voice. Not only my body, even my heart almost stopped. The moment he called my name, Miyuki, had felt like he was answering the question I had been asking myself. Like he was coldly, indifferently affirming the answer I already had in my heart.

But my brother’s voice didn’t seem cold—for some reason it felt like it was filled with compassion.

“—No, I’m fine. I guess I’m just a little tired. If I sit down a while, I’m sure I’ll recover in no time. Is it alright if I go sit in that chair over there?”

Asking the Captain, I was allowed to sit down on a chair by the wall.

Now separated from my brother’s side, I felt a little better.

My brother was holding a large pistol shaped CAD, and being instructed by Lieutenant Sanada.

At the sight of my brother my earlier doubts reared their ugly heads again, ballooning, and I leaned heavily back.

No matter how much I shake and shake, I cannot erase them from my consciousness.

Just what does my brother, think of me……?



I have no confidence it’s love.

There’s no way it could be favour.

It may be simply, that I’m hated.

If I didn’t exist, if only I didn’t exist, my brother the honour student, the elite athlete, possibly soon a full-fledged military magician, could live his own life.

Yet, right now, looking away from my brother, as if letting go of his hand, as if being shaken off, was something infinitely scarier.

“—The device has acceleration and movement compound sequences inbuilt, giving the 7.62mm bullets a maximum range of 16 km—”

“—That’s amazing. Still, the actual practicalities—”

Now holding a large-caliber rifle CAD and chatting away happily, my brother’s voice came across incoherently.

In the same room, unable to shut my eyes or block my ears, I was forced to bear the haunting dark clouds misting my mind in silence.

A thought drifted by the back of my head, wishing this would all end soon.

All the while, to prevent my selfishness from appearing in my expression, I maintained a hollow poker-face as hard as I could.





Chapter 12




November 6th, AD 2095 / Yotsuba Main House - Drawing room

Upon the sound of more knocking at the door, Miyuki turned around.

“Merely being a Yotsuba Guardian isn’t anything special. My own conceit was abruptly brought to a close by Yanagi-san, and I’m still unable to win against my master yet.”

Tatsuya and Kazama continued the story Miyuki was remembering.

“I don’t believe you held any conceit from the beginning. Also, I’m unable to win against him either as well.”

It seems Miyuki had only been spacing out for a short period of time.

Still, to her, it felt like she had recalled a great many things.

The knocking came again, stronger this time.

When Miyuki let them in, with a polished “excuse me” a young butler entered.

Rather than young, he was more simply still a youth. He did not seem to be much different in age from Tatsuya.

Despite that, not allowing a hint of irritation or impatience to show on his face, he was well trained indeed.

“I am very sorry.”

All of a sudden, the youth began to apologise.

“The business with our earlier associate is rather prolonged……could you please wait just a while longer, my lady requests.”

My lady, refers to Yotsuba Maya.

She has never married. The term “my lady” is therefore technically incorrect, but neither Miyuki, Kazama, or Tatsuya possess correcting conventional nomenclature as a hobby.

For that matter, even if they did, for the sake of politeness supplying a more accurate term was out of the question.

“It is not a problem.”

Querying Miyuki and Tatsuya visually, Kazama answered the youth’s request.

“Thank you very much.”

The youth did not bother verifying Tatsuya and Miyuki’s consent.

Setting aside Tatsuya, not even asking Miyuki, was probably because as a relative Miyuki was considered one of the Yotsuba.

That is not incorrect.

Tatsuya did not for a moment consider himself a Yotsuba, but the same cannot be said for Miyuki.

As much as she is able to reject being the eldest daughter of Shiba Tatsurou, she cannot reject being the daughter of Shiba Miya.

Therefore she, against her own desires, cannot reject being the niece of Yotsuba Maya.





Chapter 13




August 8th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Vacation House

From the first day, the Okinawa vacation had had a turbulent atmosphere. Yesterday, tranquility had been recovered. Right now on this day, time is also passing quietly.

Although you could call a boring summer vacation a problem, I would not want to endure a vacation where I was so worn out from difficulties.

At last, after our arrival in Okinawa on the fourth, we were able to enjoy our holiday in the South to the fullest.

However, I had doubt that Ani was included in “we”.

The current time is 1:00 pm. Instead of taking an afternoon nap right now, I am reading in my room. Sakurai-san found a rare paper magic textbook for me and I am indolently viewing it at my desk.

—It is good to be indolent. After all, I probably would be unable to understand all of it anyway.

Only the most technical volumes on magic are printed on paper, and even high school students have trouble getting a hold of them; it would be the height of hubris to think that I, a mere middle school student, could understand it by only reading it once.

However, that person just might be able to do it.

I received the impression that that person, in short Ani, had in his own room a workstation where he had been enthusiastically typing something related to CADs on his keyboard.

The CADs were the two gun shaped ones he had received from Lieutenant Sanada the day before yesterday.

At first, they used the word “lend” as they talked, but in no time, it became “give”. I felt like there was a cross examination over “Is this okay? Doesn’t it belong to the national defense force?” ……He said it was an investment for the future, and it was not the case that I could not understand what he was anticipating. However, unfortunately, his investment is predetermined to be a total loss. Because that person is my “Guardian”, he will never be any kind of soldier.

That is no reason to refuse what can be called a gift however, it is only a prototype after all. There is no way it has any meaning beyond a souvenir given to a visitor that has a promising future.

Now that I think of it, that person seemed to really like receiving this present.

The day before yesterday, yesterday, and today, he fiddled with the CAD system whenever he had free time. —Is he able to do some kind of CAD tuning? I have never seen him do it. Still, until now he has never shown me his combat practice either. The reason for that might be because he had no free time to rest.

I wonder if he has lost interest in it?

Could fiddling with a CAD really be very interesting?

Well, even if you call it tuning, he is probably only at the level of using switches at assigned levels. However……

Before I realized it, I was already standing in front of the door of that person’s room.

Umm, what did I come here for?

I probably want something, right.

In my confused state of mind, my left hand that was raised in order to knock on the door seemed like it belonged to someone else.

Due to my confused state of mind, my left hand froze on the brink of knocking on the door.

Somehow I feel as if I am playing the part of a buffoon without an audience for my antics. Even worse, a third rate buffoon.

I sighed and lowered my hand.

At that moment, I was about to turn on my heel and leave, however, I was a little too late.

The outward swinging door opened with a soft clink.

The door was opened in a way that took in consideration the fact that there might be someone standing in front of it. Thanks to that I did not end up with my nose struck by the door like a character in a poorly written slapstick comedy skit, but I had no leisure to put up a pretense and flee.

“Do you need something?”

Ani was acting as if he knew I had been standing there — in essence, now he knows it is right, but — he asked that upon showing his face.

“Uh, umm, er……”

“Yes.”

Ani is waiting patiently on a reply from my incoherent self.

Although I call it waiting, it cannot be discerned from his poker face. Still, he is watching me.

Ani’s composed gaze increased my bewilderment.

“Er, is it alright if I come in?”

In this situation, I had, unfortunately, become a bit hysterical; that is to say, I was overcome by a sense of peril. Before I was completely overwhelmed, I regrettably tried to forcibly terminate it. After I carelessly spoke, I thought “what are you going to do after you enter the room!?” However, that was way too late.

At that time, my face had probably turned red. Red faced and scowling — although I never intended to be glowering at him, but — in response to me who was staring at him fixedly, that person naturally widened his eyes but displayed no other sign of disturbance. He pushed the door away and invited me inside.

As usual his room was plain — that is to say there were not many things in it.

Within that deserted interior, the functional workstation made its presence known with a loud voice.

“Now, what exactly do you need?”

I could not answer Ani’s question.

At that time, my consciousness was drawn to the blatant code displayed at the workstation that was connected to a half dissected CAD. The monitor was crammed with an enumeration of numbers and letters.

Doesn’t this room look just like a CAD development lab………

To be honest, I lost my nerve.

However, the next word Ani spoke swiftly drew my consciousness back to him.

“Ojou-sama.”

“Don’t call me Ojou-sama.”

In response to me who had yelled, Ani froze in surprise.

For this person to look like he was at a loss for words is really unusual, but I do not think it was strange.

After all,

My voice just now was like a wail.

The voice sounded as if I was about to burst into tears.

“Uh……”

“………”

“Um, er……that’s right! If you do not get accustomed to speaking to me normally now, you might slip up unexpectedly later on at somewhere else, right?”

Ani’s expression switched from “surprise” to “suspicion”.

The mistrust in his gaze crushed me, but I whipped out a really bad excuse through sheer willpower.

“So please call me, Mi-Miyuki!”

However, that was as far as I could go.

When at last I finished speaking, that was my only thought as I squeezed my eyes shut.

Like a child afraid to be scolded, I grasped at the ploy of closing my eyes and bowing my head.

Although I did not know what I feared, I was indeed like a child who unconditionally feared a parent’s disapproval.

“……Got it, Miyuki. Is that all?”

Ani’s reply was gentle.

It was not his usual adult like formality; he spoke casually as if he was speaking to a friend.

Ani probably spoke to people other than me like school friends and underclassmen in that tone of voice and informal language.

Ani was gazing at me with gentle eyes while speaking to me in a gentle manner.

“……That is all.”

I am indeed about to burst into tears this time.

It is all I can do to hold back my tears.

“Excuse me, I am going back to my room”

Since I did not have the endurance to do it for long, I escaped Ani’s presence.

Taking refuge in my own room, I buried my face in a pillow.

After all, I had unfortunately been aware of it.

That gentleness had only been an act.

Even the casual words that a brother would naturally direct toward his sister in a normal sibling relationship were only the output that came from cold calculation.

I had no evidence to back my unfortunate conclusion.

But, since I am that person’s sister……

It is only at these times that I can feel the bitterness of communicating through the bonds of siblings as I try to kill the sound of my weeping.





Chapter 14




August 11th, AD 2092 / Okinawa - Airforce base ~ Villa

The two days after that passed by normally.

That person followed me around as always, and I treated him the same as always.

I thought I’d try being nicer to my brother. —No, I still think so.

I thought that if I did so, something might be changed.

But it only served as a constant reminder that habits, once ingrained, cannot be so easily corrected.

Yesterday, and the day before, I again as always, treated him selfishly. There are seven days left of our two week vacation. In those seven days, I will most likely treat him the same again and again. I cannot overcome myself.

……If it were one week ago, I wouldn’t even have noticed.

Just what is happening to me?

I don’t understand myself. I don’t understand what it is I desire.

In a state of melancholy, I supposed I had to pass this day as well with such thoughts clouding my mind.

But, happily — saying so may be far too impudent, yet it seemed that would no longer be the case — I no longer have the luxury of such thoughts.

Just as I was finishing breakfast, emergency alerts started blaring from all the devices and equipment around.



The ones issuing the alarm were the armed forces.

In other words, an attack by a foreign power.

I stared intently at the screen, as if to devour it.

“An invasion is underway from the West sea.”

“There has been no declaration of war.”

“The attack force is a fleet of ballistic missile submarines.”

“Currently, they are semi-submerged and are attacking the Kerama Islands.”



At that flood of unfamiliar words, panic threatened to overwhelm me. The only words which stuck were “ballistic missile submarine”. Was the submarine we encountered on our cruise a harbinger of this event?

“Please allow me to convey this to Maya-sama as soon as possible!”

Sakurai-san could not hide her impatience as she made her request.

“Yes, please do.”

And as she nodded, neither could Okaa-sama hide her nervousness.

I thought, no wonder.

I myself certainly hadn’t considered that we’d suddenly find ourselves in the middle of a war with no warning.

The TV anchor from earlier was making repeated calls for everyone to “please stay calm”, although he himself didn’t exactly look like a figure of composure either.

Of course. Saying something like “don’t panic” in a situation like this is far more ludicrous.

The reason I wasn’t truly panicking was because I simply didn’t have that sense of reality. I think I saw everything as if it were someone else’s problem, and kept myself in a sort of escapism.

But……what about this person?

My brother, reading in silence from a small terminal rapidly scrolling with data far more detailed than the TV reports, seemed to have misplaced his human emotions such as agitation and tension elsewhere.

In a calm atmosphere, seeming as if considering all this a mere intellectual exercise, if someone had called him a complex android I might have even been inclined to agree with them.

Does my brother not feel that this is really happening, the same as me?

Or does he really, simply not feel anything at all?

As I stared, my brother made an “oh?” face.

Just as I was thinking “what is it?”, my brother took a communication terminal out from the breast pocket of his summer jacket.

“Yes, this is Shiba……no, I should be thanking you for the other day……to the base, you say?”

From his response, I guessed that the ones on the line must be our recent acquaintances from the Defense Forces, the Captain and his squad. But the base should be in a state of war at the moment, what could it possibly be?

“I appreciate the offer, but……no……yes, I’ll try talking with my mother……alright, I’ll contact you later.”

As he finished the call, it was no longer just me staring at my brother.

Turning to Okaa-sama who was seated on the couch, my brother stood up and bowed.

“Madam.”

Facing his real mother, that person addressed her so.

Why, at such a time, does that pain come back to me, as if it was squeezing my heart?

This pain which I had never felt before one week ago.

“We have received an offer from Captain Kazama at Onna Air Force base, to shelter in the base.”

“Eh!?”

Involuntarily, I let out a sound.

He’s only met us twice, and only one of them really counts as a meeting, so why……?

Unbelievable things were piling up one after the other such that my emotions were almost saturated, but the surprises didn’t stop there.

“Madam.”

Sakurai-san held out a cordless voice communication unit, a so called “handset”.

“It’s a call from Maya-sama.”

This time not even an “eh” came out.

A call from Aunt?

To Okaa-sama?

Okaa-sama and Aunt are twins, and generally speaking it’s not too unusual for them to converse, but……it is an open secret amongst the Yotsuba that Okaa-sama and Aunt don’t really get along well.

They don’t openly come to blows, but their relationship is somewhat like the Cold War.

Which was why just earlier, without even Okaa-sama contacting her……

Before my eyes, a different sort of nervousness appearing on her face, Okaa-sama took the headset.

“Hello, Maya? ……Yes, it’s me. ……I see. I guess you’ve been using your influence…… But, wouldn’t moving be dangerous? ……I suppose……alright. Thanks.”

After she finished talking, Okaa-sama handed the headset back to Sakurai-san.

“Madam. What did Maya-sama have to say?”

Taking the headset, Sakurai-san asked that natural question.

“She has arranged for us to shelter with the Defense Forces.”

“Then, the call Tatsuya-kun received just now.”

“That would be it, it seems.”

“But, wouldn’t moving be dangerous?”

“That’s what I said, but,”

……Why? Wouldn’t a military shelter be sturdier and safer than a private one?

“Although we are not in an official state of hostilities, against an opponent who would launch a surprise attack like this, expecting them to comply with all the rules of war would be too much of a leap of faith.”

“That……I guess so……”

Seeing Okaa-sama and Sakurai-san, then my brother’s grim expression, it’s like I’m the only one who doesn’t understand the situation. Asking them to explain everything bit by bit would be demeaning however……I guess I’ll just keep quiet for now.

“Although it wouldn’t have been too difficult, she did make the effort, so let’s try doing as Maya says. Tatsuya.”

“Yes.”

My brother, who had been left standing all the while, reacted with a snap. ……Since the person himself wasn’t making a dissatisfied face, surely there was no reason for me to be feeling this.

“Contact the Captain and tell him, we accept. Also, request a pickup if possible.”

“Certainly.”

It almost seemed to me as if everything petty was being pushed onto my brother, but, I’m sure that was just me overthinking things.



Somehow, I had predicted this.

The soldier who came to take us to the base, was none other than Lance Corporal Joseph Higaki.

“Tatsuya, sorry to keep ya waiting!”

“Joe, thanks for coming all this way.”

“C’mon man, there’s no need to be so formal.”

Lance Corporal Higaki gave a bright cheerful smile.

My brother in contrast looked slightly reserved, but was still far more expressive than usual.

No matter how you look at it, the attitude he directed to this Lance Corporal whom we had just recently met was far friendlier than that he ever had towards our family.

Okaa-sama’s furrowed brow was no doubt in disapproval towards this rude behavior.

It couldn’t possibly be that she was displeased that my brother would open up more to others than his own relatives right?

Whether noticing Okaa-sama’s displeased expression, or Sakurai-san’s impatient manner, Lance Corporal Higaki stowed the familiar attitude and, snapping to attention, gave a salute.

“By order of Captain Kazama, I am here to pick you up!”

“Thank you for your efforts. Please take us there.”

“Ma’am!”

As the Lance Corporal delivered his message in a somewhat more enthusiastic manner than strictly necessary, Sakurai-san replied with a bit of a wince.

Lance Corporal Higaki showed no sign of noticing.

……Truth be told I had wished I were more worried earlier, but now I was able to at least understand a bit better why they were concerned about getting to the base.



The roads were flooded with evacuating civilians, the blaring of the stuck military vehicle’s horn lost amidst the crucible of chaos — was a scene I didn’t see.

As if the island were quietly holding its breath, the only vehicles on the roads were dark toned military ones.

The atmosphere, rather than a state of alarm, seemed more like a state of martial law. —Although I’ve only ever seen both in videos before, so I don’t exactly know the truth.

Riding in a Defense Forces car, without once being stopped at a checkpoint, without once coming under attack from an enemy, we reached the base uneventfully.

An hour had already passed since the attack began, and despite being taken by complete surprise by the yet unidentified enemy, the Navy and Air Force seemed to be managing to hold them off at the shore.

Unless you had intel from the actual island in question, you’d have no way of knowing anything was actually happening and simply have to take the military’s word for it.

Surprisingly, we weren’t the only civilians who had been evacuated to the base.

Although it wasn’t quite in the hundreds, the number of people here seemed pretty close.

In addition to us, five other civilians had been guided to this underground shelter.

It’s none of my business, but I can’t help wondering that considering the threat of enemy attack, is it really okay to invite such a large number of unrelated and useless people?

Perhaps, even we—even I, will end up having to fight.

I cannot just rely on Sakurai-san. Okaa-sama was seated on a couch, still recovering. And it will be Sakurai-san’s duty to defend her.

Until today I have never had the experience of battle, but my combat magic abilities have been judged to be no less than those of a grown magician.

That was Sakurai-san’s judgement, so it’s reliable enough.

Yet that alone wasn’t enough to dispel my anxieties, and I glanced over subtly at the neighboring seat.

My brother had sat down on the chair next to mine.

Normally he’d always stand just a bit aside or behind me, but now we were sitting next to each other so as to not draw any attention.

In his breast pocket, two CADs were hidden and ready for use at any time.

I’m unsure if this person has anything which could be considered “combat experience” either, but unlike me, he has plenty of experience killing people.

It wasn’t some paltry number like five or ten either.

I had not verified such scenes with my own eyes, but since there’s no benefit in lying to me about it, it’s definitely the truth.

In support of that experience, my brother maintained perfect composure.

His eyes didn’t wander nervously, nor did his body tremble.

Looking at my brother, my anxiety melted away just a little.

Once more……thinking that, I looked over again.

For some reason, our eyes met.

Eh? Eh? Wha? Why?

“Are you alright, Miyuki?”

……!

As agreed three days ago, that person called me “Miyuki”.

Unlike that time, not pretend-friendly, but a soft, gentle voice.





“I’m right here.”



……That’s, cheating……!

I don’t know what expression I should make.

I don’t know what expression I’m making right now.

Hey! Get a grip me! This is just the suspension bridge effect[15]! Like a horror house! Stockholm syndrome…

…Is somewhat different from this situation, but anyway, it’s all in my head!

Seriously, now of all times, hitting on your actual sister is way too inappropriate!

He himself probably had no such intention, but that’s totally irrelevant, no rather, that’s just infuriating!

I glared at my brother.

Doing so, my brother abruptly rose from his chair.

Eh? Was I really, making such an unpleasant face?

—Actually, as if not allowing my idealistic naivety to proceed any further, events were proceeding at a rapid pace. I found that out soon enough.




It wasn’t just my brother who had suddenly stood up.

One breath later, Sakurai-san also knocked aside her chair.

The strangers seated with us, wearing startled expressions, stared at Sakurai-san and that person.

“Tatsuya-kun, that was……”

“Sakurai-san, you heard it as well?”

“Then, there really were gunshots……!”

“It wasn’t a pistol but full auto, probably an assault rifle.”

……Eh? That means, the enemy is here!?

Why?

Isn’t this place right in the heart of a military base?

“Do you know the situation?”

“No, from here is……the walls of this room appear to block magic.”

“Yes……it seems, a traditional barrier magic has been erected. Not just this room, but the entire building has been covered to prevent magical reconnaissance.”

“We can still use magic just fine within the room however.”

Sakurai-san showed agreement to my brother’s words.

I had had no idea……

“Hey, y-you guys are magicians?”

Unexpectedly, a man sitting a little apart from us called out to Sakurai-san and my brother. He wore well cut clothes, and appeared to be a man of status. The ones sitting with him were likely his family.

“Yes?”

At that sudden voice, Sakurai-san answered in a dubious tone. The man continued in a rather pompous manner, although I think it was mainly bravado.

“Then, have a look at what’s going on.”

……The heck?

It’s like he’s talking to some employees.

That’s so……!

“……We are unaffiliated with the base.”

Sakurai-san also replied in an offended tone.

Under duress it seems one’s true nature shows itself, but there is no obligation to engage with total strangers, especially ones who hold no interest to you, she was probably thinking.

However, Sakurai-san’s natural point was lost on this man.

“That’s irrelevant. You lot are magicians right?”

“Yes, I said we were.”

This man wasn’t even listening to Sakurai-san’s words.

“Then isn’t it your natural obligation to serve humans?”

……!

No way, for people to still say such things with such cold conviction……

Not to mention, right to a magician’s face……!

“Did you really mean that?”

Menace crept into Sakurai-san’s voice. Her eyes were already narrowed.

Even that man flinched slightly, but his rant didn’t stop.

“I-In the first place, magicians are ‘things’ created to serve ‘people’. So it shouldn’t matter whether you’re military or not.”

My shock and anger were too strong for words.

This man had just uttered the unspeakable.

But the sad truth is, there are still numerous non-magicians who think such things.

“I see, yet even assuming that we are indeed created existences.”

Replying in my place was my brother who had until now let Sakurai-san do the speaking.

His tone was neither upset nor angry, but merely cold and cynical.

“We are under no obligation to serve you.”

“Wha!?”

“Magicians, as existences who serve society and public order, are not required to follow the whims of one unknown individual.”

To serve society and public order is a phrase in the “Charter of the International Association of Magic” well known even to non-magicians. Of course, this man likely knows it as well.

“Y-You impertinent child!”

Hence this reaction.

That man yelled red faced at my brother.

Looking at my brother’s eyes, they were filled with contempt and pity.

“Honestly……as an adult, aren’t you ashamed to act like that in front of your children?”

Although they had used the same word “child”, the meaning was completely different.

The unknown man looked back at his family with a start.

His family was looking back at him.

His own children, seeing his childish outburst, stared at him in contempt.

To the trembling man’s back, my brother delivered the coup de grâce.

“You seem to be misunderstanding something……in this country, more than 80% of magicians came about through lineage and ancestry. Even including partial treatment, the number of biologically ‘made’ magicians does not even reach 20%.”

“Tatsuya.”

Bringing matters to a close was Okaa-sama. She most likely didn’t have any such intentions though.

Speaking in a languid voice from the sofa, Okaa-sama called my brother’s name. My brother took his eyes off the trembling man’s back.

“What is it?”

“Go see and report on the situation outside.”

As usual, my mother gave instructions in an indifferent tone.

But unusually, my brother frowned.

“……More so than knowing the situation outside is the possibility that harm may befall you in here. In my current state, I cannot protect Miyuki from a remote location.”

“Miyuki?”

In a cold voice, Okaa-sama cut through my brother’s objections. Her eyes, frigid, narrowed.

“Tatsuya, do you remember your place?”

Only her tone remained courteous; her voice trembled along with her back. My brother called me Miyuki, because I had wished it. Yet hearing Okaa-sama’s soft imperative voice, I couldn’t even speak up in his defense.

“—My apologies.”

My brother apologised with a word, and didn’t speak up any more.

“……Tatsuya-kun, leave this place to me.”

Breaking into that awkward atmosphere, Sakurai-san spoke up.

Losing interest, Okaa-sama looked away.

“Understood. I’m going.”

Bowing in Okaa-sama’s direction, he left the room.

Neither my brother, nor Okaa-sama, so much as spared one glance at the man’s family as they looked on with frightened eyes.



I can hear sounds like firecrackers coming from outside.

Of course, there’s no way they’re having a festival out there.

The sound of shooting is audible even to me now.

And it’s not just gunshots which are getting closer.

A number of footsteps approached the room, and stopped outside.

Sakurai-san stepped in front of Okaa-sama and me.

Her bracelet CAD was charged with psions, ready to deploy magic immediately.

It’s difficult to maintain a ready state for a prolonged period of time like this; Sakurai-san’s technique really is quite something.

I can only see her back, but she was probably glaring sharply at the door.

“Excuse me! I am PFC Kinjou, Airborne second squad!”

Although maintaining her alert state, I could tell Sakurai-san’s tension decreased slightly. I was also relieved to hear voices on the other side of the door.

It seems like they’re soldiers from the base.

Standing behind the door when it opened were four young soldiers. They all seemed to be second generation Left Bloods, but I wasn’t particularly concerned. It was just the nature of the base’s locality.

Their machine guns being tinged with heat was probably a result of rushing here whilst exchanging gunfire with the enemy.

“We are here to take you to an underground shelter. Everyone, please follow us.”

They were expected words, yet I hesitated. If I leave now, I’ll become separated from my brother.

“I’m sorry, but one of us went out to see the situation outside.”

Before I could speak, Sakurai-san talked to PFC Kinjou.

Sure enough, the PFC frowned.

“But enemy forces have penetrated deep inside the base. It’s dangerous to remain here.”

To some extent, this was expected as well.

“Then, please feel free to take just those people along for now.”

However, Okaa-sama’s words were completely unexpected.

“I will not simply abandon my son.”

Sakurai-san and I exchanged a silent glance.

Although her words are completely natural if you think about it, a sense of discomfort remained.

“But……”

“You, Kinjou-kun was it. Please go ahead and take those people along, we will remain here.”

The man from earlier came forwards to see what was going on, and the four soldiers, now looking grim, began talking to each other in undertones.

“……About Tatsuya-kun, couldn’t we contact Captain Kazama later and get him to meet up with us?”

In that gap, Sakurai-san spoke to Okaa-sama in a low voice.

“I’m not worried about Tatsuya. That was just for face.”

Okaa-sama’s reply was returned under her breath.

I was forced to spend great effort to prevent my knees from knocking together.

Why does Okaa-sama, to her true son, act so indifferently……?

“Then why?”

“Intuition.”

“Intuition, you say?”

“Yes. Intuition that these people are not to be trusted.”

In an instant, Sakurai-san’s alertness flared to the max.

I also forgot all my grievances.

Setting her apart from others, earning her the name Ruler of the River of Oblivion “Mistress of Lethe”, Okaa-sama’s “intuition”.

Okaa-sama’s specialty magic lies not in perception nor prediction magic, but is a mental interference magic, and as “mental” magic users are hypothesised to be closely linked with the “Akashic Record”, they possess exceedingly insightful intuition……although there are exceptions, such as me.

At that time, the four soldiers also finished their consultation.

“We are very sorry, but we cannot leave you in this room. Please act responsibly, and come with us.”

The words were the same as before.

But, the feeling that their attitude has suddenly become threatening, is surely just my preconception right?

“Dick!”

A new character brought rapid developments to the scene.

PFC Kinjou, upon hearing that voice, immediately opened fire on the speaker, Lance Corporal Higaki.

There are no windows in the corridor walls so I cannot tell if he was hit, but it was certain that the voice just now had been Lance Corporal Higaki, and it was also certain that PFC Kinjou had been firing at him.

The man’s family began to scream.

PFC Kinjou’s companions advanced into the room, their muzzles aimed.

Sakurai-san immediately began an activation sequence, but a “noise” suddenly filled my head, like scratching glass, and the magic formula’s construction faltered.

This is, a Psion wave? Cast Jamming!?

Holding my ears and turning around, I saw that one of the four wore a brass ring.

Okaa-sama was clutching her chest and slumping over!

This is bad……!

From the start, Okaa-sama had extreme sensitivity to Psions. In addition, she was no longer young, and her Psion wave resistance had fallen as of late.

The Psion waves from Cast Jamming now adversely affected her body as well.

I have to stop it!

“Dick! Al! Mark! Ben! Why?”

My palms still held to my ears, I heard Lance Corporal Higaki’s voice faintly.

Thank goodness, so he wasn’t hit……

“Why are you betraying us?!”

“Joe, rather, why are you so loyal to Japan!”

Between single shots—so machine guns can fire single shots as well I thought, although honestly I could care less right now—PFC Kinjou bellowed in return.

“Have you lost it, Dick! Isn’t Japan our homeland!”

“Look at how Japan has treated us! Even though we joined the army, even though we worked for the sake of Japan, we’re still just ‘Left Bloods’ to them! We’re outsiders, no matter how much time passes!”

“You’re wrong! Dick, that’s just what you think! Our parents were unquestionably foreigners. Compared to the guys who have lived here for generations, it’s natural for them to treat us a bit like strangers! And yet the military! The unit! Our superiors and our comrades, treat us as brothers! Accepted us as friends!”

“Joe, that’s because you’re a magician! Because they see value in you, the military guys show you a good face!”

“Dick, are you really saying such a thing? Are you really saying that as a Left Blood you’re treated as an outsider, and as a magician I live a separate existence from you guys? Am I not your comrade, Dick!”

The sound of gunshots faltered.

And, the Cast Jamming Psion wave weakened.

A chance!

Judging from this instability, the Antinite user is a non-magician without a magic field. Just because you’re pushing a bunch of Psions, and are using a general form of Cast Jamming you can’t even control properly, thinking you can keep me, the candidate for the next Yotsuba head, down forever is a big mistake!

I cannot use a CAD. The time taken to initiate an activation sequence would be too much.

The only magic I can use then, is that.

The mental interference magic I inherited from Okaa-sama.

It’s different from Okaa-sama’s magic, which interferes with mental structure, but like Okaa-sama’s magic, it acts upon the target’s mind.

It’s a magic which freezes their soul.

So as to not involve unrelated people in the effect, I took aim only at the one wearing the Antinite ring—

And activated my mental freeze magic, “Cocytus”.



The Cast Jamming stopped.

I knew that the person had “stopped” as well.

He was the third human I had “stopped” in this manner.

They aren’t killed, but that which is frozen will never again melt, that which is stilled will never again move; the same as death.

To hold back my guilt, I ground my teeth together.

In doing so, valuable time was lost.

That was my weakness.

So therefore, this result was well deserved.

I knew he wasn’t alone.

I knew there were numerous muzzles pointed in our direction.

As Sakurai-san activated her magic, those triggers were pulled at the same time.

The magic Sakurai-san had been forming dissipated with no effect.

One sweep of those machine guns drilled me, and Okaa-sama, and Sakurai-san, full of holes.



The places I’m hit are,

Not so much painful as,

Hot.

My whole body is,

Cold.



I understood that flowing out of me was not only my blood, but also my life.

I am, going to die……

I had always thought that when you die you’re supposed to feel things like regret or attachment, but surprisingly I can’t think of anything.

If I could have just one regret, it would be, that I had wanted to apologise to that person properly.

If I didn’t exist, that person could have lived a more normal life.

He could have been free.

I’m sorry, Nii-san.

I’m so sorry, Onii-sa……



“Miyuki!”



I’m hearing things.

I’m thinking about my brother, so my mind conveniently fabricates my brother’s voice for me, I thought.

I mean, there’s no way my brother would call my name with so much emotion, in such a desperate voice.

As if he didn’t want me to go.

I fluttered my eyelids open with difficulty, and greeting me was the sight of an overcast sky, disappeared walls, rebels nowhere to be seen, and, my brother, with his left hand stretched out towards me.



An overwhelming “something” was released from my brother’s left hand.

It covered my dying body, easily penetrated my barrier of Data Fortification, and flowed into me.

My brother’s “heart” enveloped me.

I could think of no other way to describe it.

It read my body’s everything, and remade everything anew.
