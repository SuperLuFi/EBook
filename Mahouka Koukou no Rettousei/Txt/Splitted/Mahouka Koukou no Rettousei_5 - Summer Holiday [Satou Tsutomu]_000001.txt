Summary: The story follows Tatsuya Shiba, a bodyguard to his sister Miyuki Shiba who is also a candidate to succeed the master clan, Yotsuba. They enroll into First High School which segregates its students based on their magical abilities. Miyuki is enlisted as a first course student and is viewed as one of the best students, while Tatsuya is in the second course and considered to be magically inept. However, Tatsuya’s technical knowledge, combat abilities, and unique magic techniques causes people to view him as an irregular to the school’s standardized rankings.

Magic and Magicians





Magician




Shorthand for [Magic Skills Expert]. A generic term for persons capable of using practical-level magic. Whether the magic used is Modern Magic or Ancient Magic, all are [Magic Skills Experts]. However users of Ancient Magic prefer traditional terms like [Sorcerer], [Medium], [Ascetic], or [Ninja] when introducing themselves. It is said that 1 in 1000 teenagers have magical talent and this becomes 1 in 10000 for adults after power loss due to stresses during growth phases, but this is entirely for [practical-level magic]; persons possessing [combat-level magic] are even rarer.





Magic Sequence




Information bodies meant to temporarily manipulate phenomenon-related information. These are constructed from a magician’s stock psions. Phenomenon-related information are also psion information bodies, so magic sequences alter them like what computer viruses do. The [World] has the recovery strength to maintain temporal continuity, hence a magic sequence’s effectiveness is only temporary. Given that fact, if sufficiently prolonged magic-induced [alteration] is kept up, it can be [established] as [reality] to the [World]. Magical therapy exploits this principle.





Output Processes of Magic Sequences




Outputting magic sequences obey the following processes.

One receives the activation sequence from a CAD. This is called [activation sequence loading].

Variables are added to the activation sequence, then both are sent to the magic calculation zone.

The magic sequence is constructed from the activation sequence and the variables. This is automatically executed in the magic calculation zone, a black box process even to magicians themselves.

The constructed magic sequences are forwarded through the [Route] (it serves as the bottom layer of the conscious and the top layer of the unconscious), and outputted from the [Gate] (the threshold that exists in both conscious and unconscious mind) on to the [Idea].

The magic sequences being outputted to the [Idea] alter the Eidos at the specified coordinates, and so rewrite it.



In each magic system and magic process, completing these five processes in 0.5 second is the benchmark for a [practical-level] magician.





Magic Systems




Traditional magic classifies the techniques by applying symbolic elements to the phenomenon being activated. Model classifications include the major four elements ([earth], [water], [fire], [air]), the five rings ([sky] is added to the major four elements), and the wu xing ([wood], [fire], [earth], [metal], [water]). There are even cases when elements such as [light], [dark], [void], [nothingness], [divine], [lunar], [lightning], [mountain], and [valley] were added. Modern magic, with its roots from ESP research, are classified not from the perceived property but from its functionality.

Namely,

(Acceleration and Gravitation) (Movement and Oscillation)

(Convergence and Dispersion) (Absorption and Emission)



The above-mentioned is the four-system, eight-type magic taxonomic schema.

Of course it is known that there are always exceptions, magics that cannot be classified under modern magic’s four-system eight-type schema. So for example, since the four-system eight-type is focused on functionality, ESP (aka parapsychology, extra-sensory perception) is classified as [Perception magic], separate from the the four-system eight type magics; in this division parapsycholgic approaches are still strong. In terms of scholastic research, the magic systems are finely classified; still [rewriting information that are attached to reality and reflecting those alterations back to reality] is magic’s only truth, and this applies to both classified and unclassified magics.





Magic Processes




In modern magic the term “magic processes” carry two meanings: one, the very processes to activate magic, and two, the combined singular and multiple magic processing for the purpose of performing the target alterations to reality. For the latter meaning, taking for example magic to relocate an egg from the kitchen to the table, the required processes would be acceleration, movement, acceleration, then movement. Movement magic rewrites an object’s velocity and linear coordinates, and omitting the acceleration processes means an increase in acceleration that ignores a target object’s inertia (this means one shattered egg). Omitting the movement processing and using only acceleration and deceleration processes means the egg will follow a parabolic trajectory, and this requires extremely fine deceleration control. Even with repeated deceleration processing, using movement magic to zero out the velocity is far easier. With these four processes, it becomes the magic of [relocating an egg from the kitchen to the table]. Prevailing view says civilian-use magics requires more processing stages than military-use magics.





Magic Evaluation Standards (Magic Strength)




Magic through put (how fast one can construct psion information bodies), magic capacity (how big one can construct psion information bodies), and interference strength (how strong one’s magic sequences can rewrite the Eidos). These three together define magic strength. Other main factors like stock psion capacity (limits how many times one can activate magic) or multi-variable processing capability (influences the degrees of freedom for magic) are not counted towards magic strength. Magicians are controlled through a licensing system, and it is the norm for them to be assessed from A-rank to E-rank.





Magic Calculation Zone




The mental zone when magic sequences are constructed. The wellspring for the ability called magic. It exists in a magician’s unconscious mind, and while magicians are normally aware and make use of it they cannot sense the actual processes that are being performed there. The magic calculation zone is said to be a sealed black box even among magicians.





Summer Break




“Want to go to the sea?”

The one who had asked those words all of a sudden was Shizuku.

“By the sea, you mean the beach?”

Modern TV phone systems, as a standard, can take up to 10 calls simultaneously. As Miyuki used that system to talk with Shizuku and Honoka and engage in idle chatter, Shizuku gave a brief affirmative “yes”. That answer was a bit short, but even so it seemed to ring a bell with her friend since primary school, Honoka.

“Ah, could you mean?”

“Yes, that.”

But for Miyuki, who had only known them for around four months, this conversation was altogether on a different level.

“Could you mean…… what?”

At that, both Honoka and Shizuku realized that they had left Miyuki behind, albeit too late. They shared a glance. That being said, on Miyuki’s display she could only see them looking aside. Honoka was then the first to direct her eyes back to Miyuki.

“Well you see, Shizuku’s family has a resort in Ogasawara.”

“Eh? Shizuku, your family owns a private beach?”

“Yeah……”

At Miyuki’s question. Shizuku answered briefly again, although this time with a slightly embarrassed expression.

Recently, having a villa in the uninhabited island of Ogasawara had become fashionable among the rich, though this had been reproached by ignorant critics misunderstanding intellectual expression as “arrogantly willful destruction of nature.”

These uninhabited islands, where the resorts are, were mostly once populated islands, but had been abandoned due to the rough conditions. As these villas were zero emission (energy sources came from sunlight, so if you include energetics they weren’t truly zero emission but still), they were not destructive to nature but rather unashamed valid uses of land. Of course, Miyuki wasn’t blaming Shizuku(’s family) for anything. It was just that even among those households considered wealthy, only a handful possessed villas with their own private beach. That was probably something Shizuku also understood, but even in the case of unjustified criticism she would probably retain a manner of general common sense and feel a subconscious degree of guilt.

“My father said to ‘please invite your friends’. It seems he really wants to meet Miyuki and Tatsuya-san.”

At Shizuku’s words calibrated to change the mood (this being again something the one who had not known them very long didn’t catch), Honoka mumbled something.

“So your father will be there as well this year……”

Her expression seemed to be recalling something, most likely memories of a previous vacation she had been on with Shizuku’s father. Perhaps at the very villa they were talking about.

“Don’t worry. He’ll only be around for a short while. It seems he has a pile of work, and he’ll probably just be able to spare a few short hours.”

Honoka’s somewhat apprehensive face softened in relief at Shizuku’s words. Miyuki felt curiosity at just what could have happened, but she didn’t lose sight of priorities.

“I don’t mind, but…… what time?”

“It hasn’t been decided yet. We had been thinking whenever it’s convenient for Tatsuya-san.”

At Miyuki’s expression saying “I need to ask Onii-sama”, Shizuku understood perfectly well her answer.




“……is what we were talking about.”

Tatsuya heard of the matter during breakfast the next morning.

At first Tatsuya had considered asking “did you guys talk about that all the way until midnight?”, but of course what came out of his mouth was different altogether.

“The only ones attending will be Shizuku, Honoka, and ourselves?”

“Shizuku said she also wants to invite Erika, Mizuki, Saijou-kun, and Yoshida-kun.”

At that Miyuki hesitated slightly,

“But they’re not as familiar with them as us, so they wondered if we could be the ones to invite them.”

She probably didn’t want to say anything which would bring inconvenience to her brother. Of course, Miyuki didn’t intend to make Tatsuya do anything and was going to contact them herself, but.

“I got it. Then, I’ll contact Leo and Mikihiko. For dates, let’s see……”

Conversely, Tatsuya also didn’t want to impose on his sister, resulting in a pre-established harmony.

Taking a sip of coffee, Tatsuya went over the schedule in his head.

“……I’m free next week Friday to Sunday. Every other day is pretty busy.”

Summer break for magic high schools runs until the end of August. (For most science and literary high schools it’s mid August, while for most PE and arts high schools it’s mid September.)

Tatsuya’s summer break last year and the year before last had been mostly taken up by training with the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.

(In addition to that last year had been studying — namely, tutoring Miyuki.)

This year the first half had been taken up by the Nine Schools Competition, so things were extra tight. Developments involving the soon to be released next month “dedicated magic flight device” were also in motion.

This year as well, there was no “break” in his summer break.

“So that’s next Friday to Sunday, three days and two nights. I’ll contact Shizuku.”

Which was why Miyuki was so fired up about not missing this opportunity. To her it was a little disappointing that she wouldn’t be spending time alone with just her brother, but giving him time to refresh took priority over any of her own desires.




It seemed Shizuku really had been leaving her plans open for Tatsuya, as she immediately nodded upon receiving Miyuki’s call. Honoka was contacted by Shizuku, Erika and Mizuki by Miyuki, Leo and Mikihiko by Tatsuya, and whether the fact that everyone was free was a coincidence or not Tatsuya took with a grain of salt.

And on the day of travel he had looked on in blank amazement. He had been forced to accompany the ladies out shopping, a very attention grabbing event in the swimsuit section of a large department store; Tatsuya later relegated this memory to a distant drawer in the depths of his mind and welded it shut, hence there was no recollection of that particular event here.

For some reason, the specified meeting place was not the airport but the Hayama marina.

“Wooow…… that sure is a nice boat.”

This time (unlike during the Nine Schools Competition) Erika’s short pants weren’t out of place, so she looked up at the gleaming white hull even as she showed off her sleek shapely legs, her eyes shining.

“Doesn’t Erika’s family have a cruiser as well?”

As Shizuku questioned her with a slightly embarrassed face (Tatsuya had become quite adept at reading her expressions), Erika shook her head with a wry smile.

“We do have a ship, but it can’t really be called a ‘cruiser’…… Heck, I don’t want to call it that.

They normally turn the stabilizer off too, so it’s the worst ride ever.”

“……don’t tell me, for training?”

“Yep.”

“You guys really are quite thorough……”

Next to Miyuki’s murmur and amazed expression, Mizuki was at a loss as to what kind of face to make, so she just smiled ambiguously.

On the other hand,

“A Fleming propulsion system is it…… there aren’t any air ducts, so the power doesn’t come from gas turbines. Is it powered by photocatalytic hydrogen plants and fuel cells?”

Engrossed as he was in the boyish interest of mechanics, Tatsuya muttered to himself as he observed the propulsion in detail.

“There’re also hydrogen storage tanks onboard just in case.”

An unexpected answer came. (It wasn’t that the answer itself was unexpected, but rather the fact that an answer came at all.) Looking up, the “captain” of the ship was there.

With a Greek hat pulled low over his face and dressed in a jacket with decorative buttons, he was politely munching on a pipe.

He simply lacked that stout look slightly.

Obesity as a lifestyle disease had been eradicated 20 years earlier thanks to drug treatment, but if cosplaying a captain a bit more girth is desirable.

As Tatsuya thought so with a puzzled face, the “captain” extended a handshake. By the way, the pipe he held in his left hand really was a classic pipe. —If you looked closely enough, you’d see it was empty.

“You’re Shiba Tatsuya-kun, aren’t you? I am Kitayama Ushio, Shizuku’s father.”

He wasn’t quite able to contain his confusion at this franker-than-expected personality, but Tatsuya had far more social experience than most high school students. Rather than succumbing to embarrassment, he returned the greeting flawlessly.

“It’s good to meet you, I am Shiba Tatsuya. I have heard much about you. Along with my sister, we are pleased to make your acquaintance.”

“It’s good to meet you too.”

Taking Shizuku’s father’s proffered hand, Tatsuya intended to squeeze lightly so as to not violate etiquette, but Ushio heartily grabbed Tatsuya’s hand.

His grip was unexpectedly firm. Still, compared to Kazama and Yanagi, his hands were more accustomed to desk work. What caught Tatsuya was not the force of his hand but the power in the gaze he directed at him. Those hard-bitten eyes appraised you without making you feel uncomfortable, took the lead, strove with similar luminaries; the eyes of a leader.

“……not just a smart-ass good only for his brains. Not just a techie with superficial excellent techniques either.

Appearance truly seems superbly dependable.”

His murmur would normally be inaudible. As even Tatsuya had to consciously concentrate, that volume of voice was more than quiet enough for consideration. But even if it had been uttered in a normal volume, Tatsuya would not have considered it discourteous. Kitayama Ushio possessed the majesty to honestly appraise the value of the one in front of him.

—But.

“Yes, it seems Shizuku’s eyes weren’t mistaken. While my daughter, she really does have it together.”

At this sudden doting parent remark, Tatsuya ostensibly kept his expression neutral while sighing “so this is the great ‘Kitayama Ushio’ huh……” in his mind.

When he had said that he had heard of him earlier, that had not been mere politeness.

It’s now normal to use a business name rather than your real name in the management of a company to protect your privacy. His own father does not use his name of “Shiba Tatsurou” but rather the name “Shiibara Tatsurou[2]” in his capacity as head of development at FLT.

He had only heard from Shizuku that her father managed a business in passing, but after being told his business name, he had been quite surprised that he was such a bigshot.

He had married late (marrying a magician had involved numerous issues and although those were overcome, it had taken years) so he really should have been over 50 or so, but this frank, or rather excessively light air, didn’t seem to make him any more than 40.

“—Miyuki!”

Giving notice with a glance, Tatsuya called his sister over.

Miyuki came over at a trot, immediately assessed the situation, and bowed gracefully to Shizuku’s father.

“Pleased to meet you, I am Shiba Miyuki. Thank you so much for inviting us over.”

“Thank you for your kind words, milady. I am Kitayama Ushio. Such a lovely greeting from such a beautiful maiden is an unhoped honor both for me and my ship.”

At his placing his hand on his chest and giving a deep bow, Miyuki also with a playful smile curtsied in the Western manner.

Being faced with a beauty of Miyuki’s stature and bearing, it couldn’t be helped that even Ushio’s jaw slackened a bit.

“Ah, father. I don’t think you said any such thing when you met me?”

“Dad, it’s undignified so please close your mouth.”

However, there was no way that would be tolerated. At Ushio’s hapless appearance, a sudden barrage of words flew from two more ladies who came up.

“No no, it’s not like I was opening my mouth or anything……”

If he had only been up against his true daughter, he might have been able to make something up, but also being faced with Honoka who he had loved as another daughter since primary school, even this talented businessman floundered. (Incidentally the reason Honoka had been so apprehensive at hearing that Ushio was coming might be due to him seeing her as his daughter, every time they met he had passed not inconsiderable amounts of pocket money on to her.)

Gesturing wildly at Erika and the others who were approaching from a distance, he was obviously trying to distract the others from the topic at hand.

“—Ooh! You must be new friends of my daughter as well? Welcome. Please enjoy yourselves.

Unfortunately I have to go now, but please feel free to relax as if it were your own home.”

It was probably out of his depth dealing with his daughter unlike his business partners. His unrest could be discerned from his disjointed words.

Watching him rush into a large car with indecent haste and lifting his Greek hat in regret as he sped off, Tatsuya muttered “I think he had at least wanted to sail with his daughter……” in a voice no one could hear.




It was around 900 km to the island archipelago where the villa was located.

Tatsuya didn’t quite understand what the fun of sailing rather than flying was (it’s not unusual now to privately own VTOL propeller aircraft, and in fact that would be cheaper than a Fleming propelled cruiser), and upon asking Leo and Erika, he was simply told something like “this is the most charming way to travel”. He almost inadvertently retorted “the point of the trip is swimming, not traveling”, but had settled for muttering “these two really are a perfect pair” under his breath.

Well, everyone had come along, and no one should be seasick. Taking into account the travel time, they had gathered at 6 am early in the morning. In order to leave as quickly as possible, Tatsuya got on the ship.

The deck was even larger than it appeared from outside. There wasn’t a pool or theater or any such extravagant things (this was a “cruiser” not a “luxury liner” after all), but even if eight people got out deck chairs and hung up fishing rods, there would still be plenty of space to spare.

—However, since the entire deck was covered by a transparent dome streamlined for air resistance, it would be impossible to actually hang out any lines.

“But, when cruising at low speeds the sides are opened.”

The one who explained that was the helmsman, as well as the one who had taken care of their belongings, the omni-housekeeper Ms. Kurosawa.

From her appearance…… rather than housekeeper, it felt there should be a more appropriate word. She didn’t seem any older than her mid-twenties at most.

Though that being said she didn’t give off a soft image, as she seemed more the type to come accompanied by the “snap” SFX; still on the open sea under the blazing sun in mid summer, however much excess rays the dome could be said to cut out, Tatsuya had to wonder if she wasn’t hot in that dress. Or maybe that was just him.

Firmly wrapped up in a long sleeved summer jacket as he was, he probably wasn’t quite qualified to be thinking such things.

The ship’s design placed the wheelhouse at the bow, the cabins beneath, and the transparent dome extending from the top of the wheelhouse all the way to the back half which was the deck.

After confirming all seven passengers were aboard, Kurosawa proceeded straight to the wheelhouse, and soon the ship had left the coast.




The weather was calm throughout, and although there were some rough patches, thanks to the stabilizers and motion absorption systems no one on-board suffered motion sickness. At length, the ship eventually made it to the villa at Nakodojima island.

The atolls around the island had been devastated by feral goats in the latter half of the last century. After that, efforts to restore an artificial reef were unsuccessful. Later, villas were built, and the red clay that had been dredged up onto the coast were used via private funds to create a pier and sandy beach. This was what the “intellectuals” had been decrying as “destruction of nature”.

However, at the time the islands had been inhabited, there had been no destruction and it had been the people who had cleared out the feral goats as well. Did the destruction of nature occur because there were people, or did it occur only after they left?

He had been lost in such idle thoughts, but coming back to reality and in the face of the fact that he too had come to play at that very same sandy pier, he had to admit he was in no position to critique.

As could be inferred from his monologue, they had already arrived at the beach.

The sand was white and the sun dazzling.

But the beach was even more dazzling than that.

“Tatsuya-kun~, wanna swim?~”

“Onii-sama~, the water’s cool and very nice.~”

As Erika and Miyuki called out from the beach, Tatsuya, under the shade of a parasol positioned into the beach, shook his hands with a vague smile.



—Too dazzling.



What was dazzling, by the way, were the swimsuit clad girls frolicking around on the beach.

The first to catch one’s eyes would probably be Erika’s flashy colored one-piece. It was a simple design with no frills which brought out and enhanced her slender proportions.

Next to her, waving her hands was Miyuki in a floral-print one-piece. Her femininity increased with each passing day, and the bold pattern served to emphasize her vibrant fairy-like charm.

The surprise was Mizuki. While her polka-dot patterned separate swimsuit wasn’t as revealing as a bikini, the deep cut at the chest area showed off her ample assets, and it was impossible to link her to her usual docile image. Perhaps because of her narrow shoulders and hips, the slender curve of her waist resulted in a particular attractiveness.

Likewise in a separate swimsuit, Honoka had a pareo wrapped around one shoulder giving off an asymmetric style of mature air. If not simply considering size, but curves, this was probably the best proportioned one out of them all.

On the other hand, Shizuku was in a girlish swimsuit laden with frills. Even so, however, she continued to wear her grown-up detached expression, the two combining to create a perverted mysterious charm.

Staring at this sight made Tatsuya feel peculiarly uncomfortable deep inside, and he shifted his gaze.

To the side, flashy waves of water rose.

Leo and Mikihiko were having a (swimming) competition.

As Tatsuya watched, Leo seemed to be right in his element, while Mikihiko was desperately trying to catch his stride. ……For some inexplicable reason it made him recall a sense of intimacy.

Looking further into the distance, towards the horizon, he gradually let his consciousness drift away.

For a while, he immersed himself in solitude.

Then suddenly, he felt the presence of people.

Glancing at the bodies around him — Tatsuya complimented himself for managing not to utter a sound.

Five people were bent over looking at his face.

This would have been problematic in a normal situation, never mind in swimsuits.

“Tatsuya-san, thinking?”

Shizuku asked as she bent over him from the front at the waist, her hands on her lap. Looking from this angle, it appeared that Shizuku’s body wasn’t as childlike as he had imagined. Of course, that wasn’t something he said aloud. Likewise, staring was obviously out of the question.

“Onii-sama, we finally came all this way to the sea, so won’t you come swim?”

“That’s right. Just camping under the parasol like this all day would be a waste.”

With Miyuki on the left and Honoka on the right, surrounding him in a similar posture to Shizuku, there was no escape for his eyes wherever he looked.

Behind Shizuku, innocently waiting for his reply was Mizuki, and next to her was Erika wearing that evil grin of hers. Leaving things like this would be very bad. With no clear reason why, Tatsuya severely felt so.

“Fair enough, I guess I will.”

Getting to his feet and brushing sand off his trunks, he casually removed himself from the line of sight of those five charming figures. While keeping his eyes firmly down, he took off his yacht parka.

As the parka hit the sand, the mood visibly changed.

Oh crap, Tatsuya thought, but it was already too late.

“Tatsuya-kun, those are……”

Erika couldn’t hide the tension in her voice.

What those were soon became clear. Not just Tatsuya, but Mizuki, Honoka, and Shizuku all readily realized just what Erika had been so nervously surprised about. The eyes of those maidens were glued to “those” on his body.

Underneath the parka hid a body forged of steel. The thickness of the muscle wasn’t anything surprising. It didn’t even quite approach the volume of an adult’s body. But even whilst boyish, the chest and abdominal muscles were heavily toned and firm, almost like a Renaissance sculpture.

There was one feature there that sculptures lacked however — criss-crossing all over the skin were innumerable scars.

Many were cuts.

Just as many were punctures.

There were some minor burn marks in places.

Oddly enough there was no trace of fractures, but even accounting for that it was not a body raised in a usual way.

Mere normal training could never do this.

Nor could simply training until your blood ran.

Only actually being cut, stabbed, and burned, until blood flowed as if under torture, or perhaps the training itself was torture; could produce such a body. Precisely because Erika understood, she didn’t scream out loud.

“Tatsuya-kun… you, just what…”

“Sorry, it’s not something pleasant to look at.”

Returning an irrelevant answer to that unspoken question, Tatsuya averted his eyes from Erika and stretched out for his just discarded parka.

But his hand couldn’t reach it. That which he should have dropped in the sand a moment ago, was now firmly held tight against Miyuki’s chest as she knelt at his feet.

Although his sister, he would not allow his hand to go near a lady’s chest, so his left arm ended up wandering aimlessly through the air. Fortunately, there was no need to worry about retracting it. Because the moment he rose, his left arm was enveloped by Miyuki’s right arm.

“Wah!”

The one who had raised her voice in surprise was Mizuki. In close contact, Miyuki’s chest was pressed against Tatsuya’s arm with only a thin swimsuit between them. At that however, Miyuki showed not a hint of embarrassment.

“Onii-sama, it’s fine.”

Miyuki’s face was faintly red, but it came not from any shame at clinging to him half-naked.

“I know. That every one of these scars, is proof of the pain Onii-sama went through to become stronger than anyone.”

But rather from looking deep into his eyes at such close range.

“So, I don’t think Onii-sama’s body is anything to be ashamed of.”

At Miyuki’s words, Tatsuya’s expression softened slightly. Then, he felt the impact of something soft pressing on his right arm.

Erika gave a low whistle. It wasn’t in ridicule, but rather in praise.

He was pretty sure he already knew who it was, but nonetheless he turned his head to verify the presence wrapped around his right arm.

As expected, it was Honoka. Almost as if competing with Miyuki, she hugged Tatsuya’s arm tight with both hands. Unlike Miyuki, she was wearing a separate swimsuit, so Tatsuya’s arm was touching her soft skin directly. Whether because of that, Honoka’s face was three times as red as Miyuki’s.

“I, I don’t mind either!”

Despite fumbling at the start, she began to talk rapidly after that. Probably as a matter of course, an act which would be natural for lovers being acted upon on someone of the opposite sex, while in a swimsuit, was far too bold. It would be even weirder if she wasn’t this nervous.

Although speaking of weird, what was weirder was Honoka’s actions.

For a teenage girl, no, even a woman rich in life experience, the scars engraved all over Tatsuya’s body should be something hard to face. If there were only a few small ones there might not be any problems, but those scars would normally be associated with events of terror.

Tatsuya could only suppose that removing his parka in front of those girls despite knowing that was a stupid moment of carelessness, perhaps caused by the blazing tropical sun, he thought bitterly.

That aside Erika’s reaction, while rare, was nonetheless understandable. And as far as he was concerned he had long ago given up trying to classify Miyuki’s words and actions with anything that could be considered as “normal”. But what was behind Honoka’s actions was a mystery to him. It was almost as if—

“It’s almost like… being caught between your sister and your girlfriend isn’t it?”





“Hey, shh! You can’t say that Mizuki. Things had finally gotten interesting and all.”

Mizuki’s words were likely not desultory, but rather simply her honest thoughts. Tatsuya understood that perfectly well, but he nonetheless wholeheartedly agreed with Erika’s words “you can’t say that”. The second part however he couldn’t agree with at all.

But in between the first and second half of that sentence, Erika’s voice notably changed. Her reservation disappeared. Mizuki’s voice was the same as usual throughout.

With that evil grin Erika backed away slightly from Tatsuya, who was futilely trying to deal with Honoka still wrapped firmly around his arm (he had long since stopped caring about Miyuki).

“Uh, sorry Tatsuya-kun. I showed a strange attitude.”

“No, I don’t mind. So Erika, please don’t mind anything either.”

“Even if you tell me not to… ah, that’s right!”

I’ve just thought of something good, her expression said, as that smile lit up her face once more.

“I will properly show my atonement as well.”

As she said so she hooked the thumb of her right hand under the shoulder strap of her swimsuit and with a wink, lifted it about the width of a finger.

Next to Erika, Mizuki stiffened.

With Honoka still rapidly chattering away without lifting her head, and Miyuki looking up at him with that perfect smile, Tatsuya turned to alternatively look at the two girls still clinging to his arm.

“Let’s go swim.”

With the two of them still firmly attached to his arms, Tatsuya began to awkwardly proceed towards the beach.

Erika puffed out her cheeks, while Mizuki smiled vacantly lost in her own world.

Passing those two and catching up to Tatsuya’s crowd, Shizuku nodded and simply said “well done” to the back of the girl on the right.




A brilliant blue sky spread out overhead before Tatsuya. Floating on his back in the calm sea (only his almost submerged face rose over the surface of the water), the only sensation was the lapping of the waves.

Just a while earlier a water fight had ensued, with what could be called “jetstreams” flying everywhere (of course as if by magic, it was decided the enemy was Tatsuya); however, five girls on one guy was too much of a mental strain even for him. If Leo and Mikihiko had been around he might have been able to hang on a little longer, but the two of them must have been engaged in some serious long distance swimming as they were no longer in sight. When he had said “I’ll be off for a bit” and turned his back to those five, Miyuki’s face seemed to be filled with frustration, but as expected she understood his discomfort well.

Now the ladies were playing on a boat. The location was a beach close to where Tatsuya was drifting. Keeping a distance so as not to disturb him but within eye-shot seemed to be a compromise Miyuki, then the rest of the girls, had settled upon.

The happy voices of the girls carried over on the breeze to where he lay. Most of it was not conversation but simply senseless shrieking, yet without even looking by analyzing the pushions they were emitting he could grasp what they were likely to be doing. Honoka and Shizuku were on the boat, Miyuki and Erika in the water around the sides, and Mizuki should be sitting about under a parasol on the beach.

While being rocked by those gentle waves, Tatsuya remembered something. Honoka had said she wasn’t a very good swimmer. Though she was in a boat it wasn’t particularly big, nor was it particularly stable, and he wondered if it was alright for her to come so far out.

That ominous premonition turned out to be right on the money. Whether the power of language or a flag as it’s designated by various people, the idea was that unfortunate possibilities if put into words would transcend theory into reality. That doesn’t simply apply to words uttered from the mouth, but thoughts formed in the mind as well.

A scream suddenly cut through the calm summer air. Tatsuya perceived the capsizing event as information faster than the eye could see, and immediately rose onto the surface of the water and began sprinting full throttle towards the boat. It was a movement technique he would normally never use if others were around to see, but it sure was a heck of a lot faster than swimming.

Running up next to the capsized boat, Tatsuya in one step had continuously been Flash Casting a surface tension amplification magic to achieve an effect like a “water spider”.

Tatsuya dived feet-first into the water. Following Miyuki’s gestures who had dived in earlier, Tatsuya hooked his hand around Honoka’s waist. In an understandable state of panic, Honoka was wildly flailing her limbs, kicking away even as Tatsuya brought her up to the surface of the water.

Above him, Erika had pushed Shizuku back onto the boat. Either Erika or Shizuku had righted the overturned craft. Tatsuya decided to think about just how they had managed that later, and took Honoka towards the boat.

Ever since making it back onto the surface of the water she had calmed somewhat, but she was still in a relatively agitated state. Desperately and unreasonably resisting being led to the boat, she kept pleading “please wait a bit!” and “I beg you!”. However, just by being in the hot water of that summer sea would sap her depleted strength further. Because of her weakened state, it was necessary to have her rest inside the boat. Tatsuya reluctantly shook his head, and forcibly lifted Honoka’s body into the vessel. The momentum propelled half of her body inside, and before she could rise she was restrained by Shizuku. Seeing her up close from the front, Tatsuya suddenly realized why she had been so reluctant.

The swimsuit Honoka had been wearing had probably been designed with fashion foremost in mind, and swimming practicality after.

Her swimsuit was missing the top.

Tatsuya shut his eyes tightly, and wordlessly allowed the gravity from his lift to carry him back down beneath the waves.

A fresh scream rent the peaceful air, as Honoka crouched down and covered her chest with both hands.




“Hic, hic, sniff…”

“Uh, uhmm, is there something… Honoka-san, are you alright…?”

Upon reaching the beach she had broken down and began crying in earnest, and in confusion Mizuki who didn’t know what had happened was trying to comfort her. The other three — Shizuku, Erika and Miyuki stood around the two in abject embarrassment.

“Hic… that’s why, hic… I told him… sniff, to waaait…”

Of course, the one who felt the most awkward was Tatsuya. Truth be told, he would have wanted nothing more than to run away.

However, this wasn’t something he could just hide from.

“That, well… Tatsuya-kun was just trying to help…”

Erika’s words naturally had no effect. Miyuki wasn’t able to find words for either party, not even Tatsuya.

“Honoka, I uh… I’m sorry.”

Tatsuya himself had had no malicious intent, and although he held no accountability in that regard, he couldn’t just keep an indifferent face. Thinking so Tatsuya bowed low, as Shizuku whispered something in Honoka’s ear.

“Honoka, you know that Tatsuya-san isn’t to blame.”

A quiet voice only Honoka could hear.

“He gave you plenty of time to fix your clothing after.”

Despite the small volume, and despite the numerous contradictions, Shizuku’s words seemed to have a calming effect.

“This wasn’t exactly according to plan, but…”

However, it also seemed something suspicious had gotten mixed into those comforting words.

“This is a good chance.”

That line was somewhat conspiratorial.

Shizuku had a few more inspirational words with her, then Honoka finally looked up.

“Tatsuya-san… are you really sorry?”

“I am being perfectly sincere. I truly am very sorry.”

As Tatsuya bowed again, Honoka muttered “Then…”

“…just for today, listen to everything I say.”

“Come again?”

At those totally unexpected words, confusion settled on Tatsuya’s face. Honoka didn’t fit the image of someone who would say something like that at all. Not just Tatsuya, but Miyuki and Erika wore similar expressions.

“If you do, I’ll forgive you. Is that ok…?”

Tatsuya and Miyuki exchanged glances.

Miyuki’s crooked smile seemed to suggest “it can’t be helped”.

“…If that’s what you want.”

Although she had said “whatever she says”, he knew she wasn’t a girl who would make malicious requests like in the “King’s game” that was popular several decades ago. As he nodded yes, Honoka happily cried “it’s a promise!” with a broad smile.




By the time Leo returned from his looo-o-ong (both in distance and duration) swim, he was just in time for tea on the balcony.

Cold drinks and colorful fruits were arrayed all over the table.

The acting waiter Kurosawa didn’t wear a costume underneath her apron, but a light, mini one-piece. Her shoulders were bare, and her slender limbs peeked out from behind the apron that was larger than the dress itself. The sheer sex appeal it exuded would have instantly attracted the eyes of any teenage male, but today there were four more powerful swimsuits alongside her.

Taking a step back and looking maturely, two were beauties and two had already surpassed the level of the word beauty. For Leo, however, who distinctly felt “food before romance” before these four swimsuit clad forms, not even Kurosawa’s “adult appeal” was a match for him.

But that didn’t mean he was insensitive. Recognizing those four swimsuits, Leo remarked “oh?” as he looked around.

“Where are… Tatsuya and Mitsui?”

“They’re in, the boat, way over there.”

The answer came not from the table, but from behind.

Tired all over and dripping seawater, Mikihiko breathlessly answered as he pointed.

Tatsuya and Honoka were heading out to sea in a retro rowboat.

“…What the heck’s going on?”

“Stuff happened. Yeah, stuff.”

At Leo’s question, Erika answered toothily.

Rather than curt, that expression was almost a sulk, and as she turned away, Leo, rather than being offended had his curiosity piqued further.

Seeing Mikihiko watching the scene with interest, he also immediately looked over to sea.

Wearing a straw hat, Tatsuya’s expression was hidden under its shade and indiscernible.

Honoka held a parasol and had her back turned to them, so her expression likewise couldn’t be seen.

Even so as the small boat receded from the shore, Mikihiko could feel the exceedingly peaceful air they gave.

“…That’s quite the nice atmosphere isn’t it?”

“You two, hey,”

You morons, she left unsaid.

Even as Erika freaked out, a cold air cut through the room from the opposite seat.

Snap snap snap… Mikihiko could hear these ominous sounds coming from the girl sitting next to him, reminiscent of deepest winter.

“Mikihiko-kun, won’t you have a chilled orange?”

Talking affably, Miyuki laughed as she passed a far too cold orange to Mikihiko.

With perfect timing, Kurosawa passed him a spoon.

Mechanically, Mikihiko took the sorbet spoon from her.

Miyuki had another piece of fruit in her hands. Once again, that snap snap snap… sound could be heard, and immediately she was holding a raw mango sorbet. Removing her frozen gaze from the fruit she had been staring at, she offered it to the person across from her with another bright smile.

“Saijou-kun, won’t you have one too?”

“Ah… thanks…”

Leo decided that answer would be for the best.

Miyuki directed her gaze back at the mountain of fruit before her, but perhaps losing interest, glumly looked away.

“Shizuku, I’m sorry, but I feel a bit tired. Could I rest somewhere for a while please?”

“It’s fine, don’t worry. Kurosawa-san?”

“Of course. Miyuki-ojousama, right this way.”

Following Kurosawa, Miyuki slid away into the villa.

Compared to Mizuki’s cringing expression, Shizuku’s signature poker-face was a marked contrast.




Dinner was a barbecue.

Eight people gathered harmoniously around the console, with Miyuki perhaps calming down after resting going back and forth between the table and the barbecue.

Before going off to incessantly pester Tatsuya, Honoka happily chatted away with Erika and Shizuku.

Perhaps because of the trauma incurred during teatime, Mizuki sat away from Miyuki and the others, engaging in conversation with Mikihiko.

Leo was wolfing food down with gusto. Kurosawa was almost exclusively serving him.

Of course the groupings weren’t exclusive, with Honoka joining Miyuki’s group sometimes, and Tatsuya getting into a foodfight with Leo.

But somehow — somehow compared to usual, there was an awkward air floating in between them.




It was the calm before the storm.

It’s impossible to be sure of what will happen, but something definitely was going to happen — the one who broke that position and raised the curtain, was someone unexpected.

As soon as the card game the five girls had been playing ended in Mizuki’s defeat, Shizuku asked Miyuki “Will you come with me for a bit?”

“…Sure.”

Her confusion lasted only for a second.

Almost immediately, Miyuki was smiling again.

“…Um, are you guys going for a walk? I’ll come too.”

“You can’t Mizuki. You have to go through the punishment game.”

As Mizuki rose to follow after Miyuki, Erika grabbed her by the shirt and pulled her back down.

“Ehhh!? I didn’t hear anything about that!”

“The loser obviously has to go through a punishment game. Anyway with that being said, you two take care.”

Whether reading the air or not Erika subtly bound Mizuki, and pretending not to notice the tensions between them she waved Miyuki and Shizuku off.

The ones who sensed the tense atmosphere weren’t just the ladies. After finishing dinner, Leo grabbed the pudding and took off, probably realizing the situation and Mikihiko, who was unable to concentrate on his game of chess, shot side glances at the girls.

“Checkmate. 10 more moves.”

“Ehh, already!?”

Cried out at Tatsuya’s ruthless sentence.




Leaving the villa, they turned left onto the beach.

Shizuku walked on in silence, and Miyuki followed in silence.

They proceeded in that way and when the lights of the villa could no longer be seen, Shizuku turned around.

Her normally expressionless face was tense.

Miyuki simply smiled, but that expression was an archaic smile from which no emotions could be read.

“Sorry for making you accompany me all this way.”

“It’s fine. Is there something you wanted to talk about?”

Even at Miyuki’s prompting however, she couldn’t bring herself to immediately cut to the chase.

After counting 10 rounds of waves washing gently over the shore, Shizuku opened her mouth.

“I want to know.”

“About what?”

“Just how does Miyuki feel about Tatsuya-san?”

At Shizuku’s question without any covering or roundabout approach, without any explanation or reason of intent,

“I love him.”

Miyuki answered in a single word with absolute calm.

“…Is that, as a man?”

Rather, the one who seemed upset was Shizuku. She keeping her cool was probably just another aspect of her personality.

“No.”

Miyuki’s answer came without the slightest hesitation.

Her expression was serene.

“I love and respect Onii-sama more than anyone. But, that’s not as a woman. These feelings I have for my brother are not romantic love. There could never be such a love between him and I.”

Meeting Shizuku’s gaze,

“I’m curious to know, why would you ask such a question of me?”

She gave a sly grin.

“It’s fine. I have no intention to interfere with Honoka whatsoever. …Just so you know, I will feel really jealous though?

So rest assured, although I guess that’s going to be difficult.”

As Miyuki gave a light laugh, Shizuku’s expression seemed to be nearing tears.

“…Why.”

“Why what?”

“Why…do you try to detach yourself like that? I mean, when it’s so evident that you love Tatsuya-san so much.”

Miyuki took a step towards Shizuku.

Shizuku visibly stiffened, but, she didn’t flinch.

Miyuki walked past her in that way, until they were back to back.

“…It’s difficult to explain the relationship between us siblings to someone else. There are too many speculations intertwined. But the feelings I have towards Onii-sama are not so simple as that.”

“…Are you really siblings?”

As Shizuku turned around,

“You’ve asked a pretty well worn question.”

Miyuki answered with her back still turned.

“…I’m sorry.”

“No, I’m not blaming you or anything.”

Shaking her head, Miyuki’s smile was carefree.

“Very well… since you have a friend who really is trying her hardest.”

“I… also think of you as my friend.”

“I know. Which is why you’re so conflicted right? You’re doing your best not to hurt either of us.”

At Miyuki’s gentle gaze, Shizuku abashedly looked away.

“As I was saying… Onii-sama and I are true siblings. Or at least that’s what it says on the records, and DNA tests have always confirmed that relation.”

“But…”

“I know what you want to say.”

As Shizuku stammered, Miyuki nodded understandingly.

“These feelings I have for Onii-sama, even I know it transcends the realm of normal sibling bonds.”

Shizuku fell silent in embarrassment.

“You know… in truth, I died three years ago.”

“Huh?”

In light of this confession, not even she could suppress her voice.

“Or maybe it’s better to say I should have died? But at that time, I truly could feel my life fading from my body, so I suppose ‘I really did die’ isn’t that inaccurate either.”

As Miyuki spoke her smile was so fleeting, and the line “I really did die” delivered with such conviction that Shizuku couldn’t help but feel a shiver run down her spine.

“It’s because of Onii-sama that I can stand before you like this. Being able to cry, to laugh, to speak with you right here and now, is all thanks to him. I owe my life to him, and all I have and all I am belong to him alone.”

“That’s…”

The question “what does that mean?” remained unspoken, and no answer to it came.

“The feelings I have for Onii-sama are not romantic love.”

The answer she gave instead referred to the second question “as a man?”, and the conviction in her voice was no less than before.

“Romantic love, means you want something from that person doesn’t it?”

Even if she could have conversely asked Miyuki “isn’t love wanting that person to be yours?”, Shizuku didn’t reply. She believed it wasn’t suitable, and besides,

“But, there is nothing I want from Onii-sama. Because I have already received me myself from him.”

She instinctively understood Miyuki wasn’t searching for an answer.

“I don’t desire anything more from him. I won’t even ask him to accept my feelings. In the end… I guess, love[3] is the only word I could use to describe it.”

“…I got it.”

At Miyuki’s confession, Shizuku could do nothing but raise the white flag.

“Miyuki, you really are the real deal.”

“I think it’s a somewhat warped way of looking at things myself.”

As Shizuku just shook her head, Miyuki closed one eye and gave a mischievous smile.




Soon after Shizuku and Miyuki left, Honoka went to check herself in a mirror. When she left the room, she said she was “going to pick flowers”.

While she looked herself over, she ran through the words Shizuku had said. “I’ll take Miyuki outside, so you invite Tatsuya in the meanwhile”.

She had immediately known what she meant. Shizuku understood Honoka’s feelings perfectly well without needing to consult her. Truthfully speaking, the capsizing incident earlier had also been something “orchestrated” by Shizuku in an attempt to bring Honoka and Tatsuya together. She had informed him earlier that Honoka was not a good swimmer, and her plan had been that Tatsuya would save her then Honoka could use that as a pretext to approach and thank him. In case Tatsuya didn’t make it in time, she also had a followup plan prepared. What had eventuated was a complete accident, but as a result Honoka had been able to monopolize Tatsuya for the day, so even as Shizuku felt guilty she was also rather happy.

Now, Shizuku had set the stage for Honoka’s confession. Apprehensively, Honoka applied a light covering of pale rouge. Touching up her hair and rechecking her attire, Honoka muttered “alright!” as she psyched herself up. According to plan she was to lure Tatsuya away while Miyuki wasn’t here, and Honoka proceeded back in to the living room.

She wasn’t even aware that her feet were trembling slightly.




Walking next to Tatsuya and stealing a glance at his face every now and then, Honoka was troubled as to when she should start talking.

So far everything was going as envisioned. When she had asked him “would you come outside with me for a bit?” he had immediately replied yes, which puzzled her somewhat.

In a way, the far too smooth start had shaken her slightly. Tatsuya was silent.

Out from the villa they had turned right, and as if to shelter Honoka from the waves Tatsuya had walked on the sea side throughout.

Somehow, it felt to Honoka as if he had already guessed her intentions and was avoiding reaching the conclusion.

A growing sense of crisis welled up within her that if she didn’t act herself, nothing would be resolved.

“Tatsuya-san.”

After opening and closing her mouth countless times Honoka finally managed to let out a strained voice, and Tatsuya stopped and turned around.

By now the lights of the villa were out of view.

Other words which were even now being exchanged that same night were lost to the sound of surf and never reached them.

Under the endless starlit sky, accompanied only by the murmur of the waves, Honoka stood looking at Tatsuya face to face.

However, she couldn’t proceed. Even as he encouraged her with his eyes, Honoka could only glance aside and start chattering.

“I…”

At times she would look up, meeting his gaze as if trying to say something, then with a strained expression stammer something out; this process was repeated numerous times.

“Yes, what is it?”

Tatsuya encouraged her in a softer tone than usual, with softer words than usual.

Perhaps encouraged more by his voice than his words,

“I… uhm, I… I like you!”

These words that Honoka finally managed to squeeze out, after all her hesitation, may have even managed to penetrate through to the other side of the darkness.

But Honoka didn’t think about that at all.

Right now, to her, the two of them were the only ones in the whole world.

“—So how does Tatsuya-san feel about me?”

Unable to look him in the eyes Honoka squeezed her eyes tightly shut, yet an answer didn’t come.

“…Did I cause you trouble?”

Gingerly opening her eyes Honoka asked in a tearful voice, but Tatsuya simply shook his head with a smile.

“Not at all. I had a feeling you might say something like this. Though I only realized around afternoon today.”

As they looked at each other, Honoka felt she could sense a deep indescribable sadness in his eyes.

Preparing herself for the sorrow that was sure to come, Honoka squeezed her hands tightly. But Tatsuya’s response, for better or for worse, was something unexpected entirely.

“…You know, Honoka, I’m actually a human missing part of his soul.”

“…eh?”

“When I was a child, I was involved in a magic accident of sorts… some of my mental functions were erased.”

Honoka’s face paled visibly. Her pallor was evident even in the dark night.

Her eyes were open wide, and only a “no way…” leaked out as she covered her mouth with her hands.

“At that time, I guess, I lost all of what you could call feelings of love. They weren’t sealed, so they can’t be released. They weren’t broken, so they can’t be fixed. That which is lost, cannot be recovered.”

Tatsuya spoke casually as if it were someone else’s affair.

“I can’t feel love. I can like someone, but I could never fall in love with them. In a way, only the knowledge remains. Searching my mind, I can tell a part is missing.”

As Honoka covered her mouth, she didn’t utter anything like “that’s a lie” or “I don’t believe it”. She was literally shocked speechless. Only Tatsuya’s profession rang though her mind.

“This may be an underhanded way of speaking, but, I do like you. However, that’s only as a friend. No matter how hard you try, I will never be able to think of you as a special woman. That will definitely be something painful for you — something that will hurt you.”

Saying so, a powerless smile drifted across his face.

“Which is why I cannot answer your feelings.”

Tatsuya fell silent.

Honoka likewise.

Only the sound of breaking waves filled the dark night.

As the tide gradually crept up the shore,

and at length, finally reached their feet,

Honoka raised her head.

“Please don’t be mad… you know, I had thought, Tatsuya-san liked Miyuki. Not as a sister, but as a woman.”

“…That’d be a misunderstanding.”

“Yes, it seems so. Tatsuya-san is smart, so… if you were lying, you’d definitely be able to come up with something more credible. I’ve never heard of a magic capable of erasing partial features of the mind, yet even so, I believe you. Still, that being said, it also means you’ll never be able to love any other girl right?”

Somewhat puzzled at this unexpected turn of events, Tatsuya answered “well, yeah…” with a nod.





“…If so, then it’s fine.”

“?”

“From now on always, Tatsuya-san will never have a lover right? If so, for me to like you, wouldn’t turn into an illicit love right?”

“That’s… true, I suppose.”

“Then there’s no problem. From now on as well, I’ll continue to like you! Um, until I can like someone else that is!”

Her declaration was bright.

“…I don’t mind.”

Tatsuya nodded with a wry smile.

He wasn’t so dull as to not understand why Honoka had purposely added “until she likes someone else”.




The sun aggressively asserted itself the next day as well.

The temperature was in excess of 30°C from the morning.

In that sweaty weather, upon the sandy beach—

A fierce scorching battle was being waged.

“Onii-sama, my back. Won’t you help me with this sunscreen?”

“Tatsuya-san, want some juice?”

Or,

“Shizuku is lending us her jetski. Want a ride?”

“Apparently there’s a nice dive spot just over there, want to go?”

And so on, while the others around felt the oppressively heated atmosphere.

“Miyuki, you really were holding back yesterday, huh…”

“Honoka-san, it seems a great weight has been lifted from you, huh…”

As Erika and Mizuki looked on in amazement,

“…”

Shizuku’s face was troubled,

“Well, it seems he really has it tough.”

Leo’s face was filled with compassion,

“…Yoshida-kun, what’s the matter?”

“Eh, no, it’s nothing.”

and Mikihiko was — no, well, for the sake of his honour it’d be best not to say.

Anyway as their friends each had their own separate thoughts as they gazed their way, Tatsuya alternated between Miyuki and Honoka’s requests, sighing at every turn.

When jet skiing, he rode tandem with Miyuki in the passenger seat (afterwards was Honoka).

Truth be told, Honoka was actually a fairly competent swimmer — yesterday she had panicked for a different reason — as he went with her via motorboat to the dive spot (Miyuki also came along).

After applying sunscreen (or rather reapplying), he had food pushed into his mouth one after the other, like a goose being fed for foie gras (“ahhn’s” accompanied and all).

Being caught in this pressure hotter than the Ogasawara air mass (love pressure?), Tatsuya who was being constantly buffeted around in this burning atmosphere…

More than yesterday, more than ever, looked forward to being able to relax again.





The Honour Student’s Supplementary Lesson




Entering into the second half of summer vacation, First High’s campus became rather deserted.

With the Nine Schools Competition – a major event of the summer season – drawing to a close, the various athletic clubs fell into a state of self-guided practice. Another week into the future, all the clubs would once again be bustling with activity in order to welcome the new semester, but currently even club activities fell prey to summer vacation.

Yet, the place was not completely deserted as a small minority of students still came to engage in individual practice. This was especially the case for Year 1 students, who found it difficult to use the training facilities when certain upperclassmen were present and could now take full advantage of this opportunity to fully employ the facilities.

In the sealed practice field for mock battles, the figures of many a Year 1 student could be seen.




Someone was running amidst the irregularly erected large, square pillars.

With vision so severely limited like this in a room, this was practically a maze even if there were no walls. The intermittent flashes of light as well as the abandoned terrain littered about one’s feet aroused the terror that one might stumble at any moment.

Nevertheless, deceleration was out of the question even under these conditions. This was a timed exercise that was in progress. Even if this was individual practice, leaving behind a terrible blemish was unacceptable.

The forest of pillars split into a fork in the road.

The choice was made in a flash – take the right path. There was an automatic turret set just ahead.

As if on reflex, the right hand holding the CAD aimed the “muzzle” and pulled the trigger.

The preset Mass-Type Magic for competitive use was triggered.

The gravity sensory devices flipped a switch and the automatic turret ceased moving.

Cold sweat dripped down his back a little after the fact, but there was no time to ponder this. In order to salvage the time lost when his footsteps came to a halt on reflex, he had to pick up the speed to complete the exercise. Thus, he passed to the side of the motionless automatic turret and corrected his trajectory by following the curve formed by the pillars on the left.

At that instant –

--His flank suffered a vicious impact.

--The alarm signaling his disqualification rang out.




Along the racetrack that was illuminated once more, Morisaki grimaced as he glanced down at his body. A red paint pellet was tightly stuck to the right side of the practice uniform worn by the Battler Shooting Club.

The pellet could be directly peeled off by hand since it had already dried off, but in order to properly clean the uniform he needed to use the removal fluid stored in the preparation room. Morisaki swiftly headed for the exit in order to avoid obstructing the next user.

The sound of him brutally shoving the door open caused the female student performing maintenance on the shooting device used for Guided Shooting to widen her eyes and turn around. (Guided Shooting utilized bullets fired with magic rather than employing gunpowder or compressed air. This was a magic competition that fired small bullets that had a diameter of 2.54 cm (1 in). The shooting device used specifically for Guided Shooting was shaped like a rifle and the stock of the rifle was altered so that there were four channels fixed in place so bullets could be inserted from four different locations and a CAD was mounted within.)

“……Morisaki, you’re rude.”

This female student – Takigawa Kazumi from Year 1 Class C, stopped working on the shooting device and turned a caring voice towards Morisaki.

“Takigawa…… You’re a member from the Guided Shot (Guided Shooting Club). What are you doing here?”

“Woah, you actually responded like that.”

Just as Takigawa said, Morisaki’s response was “like that” and certainly rubbed others in the wrong way.

“I came to look for a few components for the internal CAD and I have received permission from your club leader. That’s why I think there’s no reason for you to ask something like ‘What are you doing here’?”

“Hmph…… And this can’t be done in storage?”

“So sorry about that. I’m going to say this first, sharing excess components has always been a tradition among the shooting clubs. Morisaki had no idea because you always use your own CAD.”

Setting aside members of the Student Council or Public Moral Committee who have been granted the right to carry CADs on campus, “normal club members” had to configure the reserve CADs provided to the various clubs and equipped with restrictions in the Local Positioning System for personal use. Upon entering high school, Morisaki had immediately joined the Public Moral Committee and had always used his own CAD even during club activities, so there was no chance he could have learned about the club’s processes and procedures for CAD maintenance.

This rejoinder was normally proof against any rebuttal, but Morisaki only snorted and turned his back on Takigawa. Wholly ignoring her words about “rubbing the wrong way”, he removed the spray can from the cabinet by the wall and sprayed it over his flank. The paint pellet stuck to his side fell off and landed on the ground in one piece. Several similarly red contours lay scattered across the floor.

“Morisaki…… How many times has it been now? Aren’t you pushing yourself too much? You should probably call it a day now.”

“……Are you worried about me?”

“Of course I’m worried about you.”

Morisaki rubbed away at the sweat that endlessly dripped from his forehead and spoke with a mocking tone. Takigawa nodded in earnest in reply.

“I want to make this perfectly clear. This is not because I’m interested in you, crushing on you, or some sort of malicious joke. I just can’t stand by and say nothing as someone I know collapses in front of me.”

“—I’m aware of that.”

Heedless of her words, Morisaki left those words as he turned to leave. Takigawa pressed on.

“In that case, you should stop here today. Continuing to practice will only pointlessly waste your strength, nor can you derive any personal satisfaction out of it.”

Takigawa directly took in the ugly glare Morisaki sent her way without averting her eyes.

“—I got it.”

The one who looked away first was Morisaki.

He ceased to speak and vanished into the men’s changing room.

“I can relate to that sort of anxiety, but…… No, I probably can’t understand. After all, ‘he’ and Morisaki are both boys.”

Takigawa watched his back disappear and murmured to herself.




Morisaki took off the club uniform and changed into a shirt and the school pants. Just as he was about to put on the school uniform for the summer, his eye fell across the embroidered insignia on the pocket that lay over the left bosom.

--Four months ago, he took pride in that insignia.

--Yet recently, he was usually confounded by a frustration that found no release.

This unexplainable frustration continued to erode Morisaki’s heart. Nay, perhaps it was more appropriate to describe this as “a truth he did not wish to explain”.

Morisaki forsook wearing the coat and draped it over one shoulder as he walked out of the changing room.

He squinted his eyes and raised his gaze towards the blazing sun that illuminated the earth.

Even without Takigawa reminding him, Morisaki could feel the anxiety building in him.

Still, without her putting it so plainly, Morisaki might still be wasting his time on fruitless self-practice even now. That was something Morisaki comprehended.

Next time they met, he should buy her a popsicle, Morisaki thought.

His injury from the Nine Schools Competition was deemed as having to take over a month to heal, though thanks to the advent of magical healing, he was the picture of good health. Nevertheless, his body had grown rusty after staying in the hospital for a week and he hadn’t fully recovered to his original level. At least, that was how Morisaki felt about himself.

Also……

--Forget being boosted by the experience on the grandest stage, his magic skills seemed to have regressed compared to his state before summer vacation—

This doubt lurked in the recesses of his heart.

Morisaki was aware that this was not a healthy state of mind, but he was unable to beat down his frustration.

(After all, there’s no teacher present……)

Course 1 students possessed the “privilege” of being individually instructed by the instructors, but this was of course out of the question with no instructor on campus. This went beyond Morisaki, as even the participants of the Nine Schools Competition wouldn’t typically receive instruction during summer vacation and would have to make an appointment for some time after next week.

If all he wanted was to learn theory then a simple visit to the library would suffice, but at the moment Morisaki was contemplating how to improve his technical skills. He was not decadent enough to ask for practical experience, but at the very least he wished to improve his magical abilities. That was the thought that dominated Morisaki’s mind.




When speaking of the Morisaki Family, the first thing that came to mind was the “Quick Draw” technique.

Among the Hundred Families, the Morisaki Family was a side family that did not possess a “number”. Though their magic power was rated as pedestrian, when it came to practicality under specialized conditions, they received high praise thanks to their unique talents. Even when compared to the “Numbered Families”, their talents matched if not exceeded them outright.

So, what sort of technique was “Quick Draw”?

In reality, this title did not contain any hidden meaning. “Quick Draw” was simply “quick activation”. This technique was designed with one thing in mind – how to activate magic as quickly as possible when employing CADs. Specifically speaking, this was a technique that jumpstarted CAD activity and activation before the CAD had even been raised in hopes of using magic to subdue the opponent before they could release their magic.

Strength was a secondary priority.

Degree of difficulty was not within the realm of consideration.

Even if the strength of the magic was lowered, so long as the attack could be launched first then a successful incapacitation of the enemy could be achieved.

After CADs became available at large, the speed of magic activation also increased. This technique was developed with this consideration in mind to utterly maximize speed and its element lay in the development and modification of CAD operation to raise efficiency.

In pursuit of speed, the focal point naturally drifted towards Specialized CAD and not Generalized CADs. Specialized CADs in the form of handguns were currently mainstream, so the first developed technique was the motion of swiftly drawing the handgun-shaped CAD and firing.

Hence the English name “Quick Draw”.

This initial development brought about an unforeseen side effect.

From not holding a CAD, which is to say being “completely unarmed”, to striking down the ambusher by activating magic before they could. This technique was highly compatible with Japanese operatives who usually carried concealed arms.

American special agents might intentionally brandish a weapon to threaten the attacker, but Japanese agents were asked to conceal their weapons so as to reduce the anxiety level of their principals or related personnel.

Owing to the unique nature of this ability, the Morisaki Family frequently accepted bodyguard requests. Their primary clients were civilian corporations that could not always call upon the police or military for personal protection. Although their primary objective remained researching modern magic, the Morisaki Family was better known in society for their side job running a protection agency.

Morisaki Shun was the only son of the Morisaki Family’s main branch (there were no other young men in his generation) and had started working in the agency two years ago. As a youth, people were not as wary of him. Rather than serving as a primary accompanying agent, he utilized this to his full advantage and served in a support role and observed the surroundings from the rear while preventing attacks.

When the agency was short on manpower, he was always called upon to assist regardless of whether he had the time (even though this was a side job), but recently he had not been asked to undertake any missions. Currently, Morisaki wasn’t interested in conducting practices that had no physical sense of accomplishment as he was more desirous of real (combat) experiences that validated his existence. However, he was not dispatched on a mission today either.

After removing his uniform jacket and tossing it aside, Morisaki caught the eyes of the frustrated young man watching him from the mirror.

The face belonged to him and no one else.

Takigawa’s warning reverberated in his ears.

Morisaki was aware that his current mental status was decidedly in poor condition.

He needed to switch gears while the warning from other people still dwelt in his mind – he told himself while forcibly suppressing his frantic mood before changing from his uniform into casual wear.




Even if this was a spur of the moment outing in the afternoon, he could immediately find four or five companions if he opened his communication device right now.

Yet, Morisaki chose to walk the streets by himself.

He kept a small CAD hidden in the front pocket on the inside of his vest and kept the smaller, scattered belongings in a backpack slung over one shoulder before hitching a ride on the bus to downtown.

His destination was chosen entirely on whim. He did not come here for some specific purpose nor was this Morisaki’s preferred stomping grounds. Strictly speaking, he probably just wanted to will away the hours in a location that wasn’t too noisy but fairly lively at the same time.

With so many parks in the area, this location belonged to more than just youngsters. Still, during daylight hours on a day that wasn’t a holiday, the most conspicuous figures were young men and women of high school age enjoying their summer vacation. Most of them wore clothing appropriate for the summer season with an emphasis on cooling off.

This was rather refreshing for Morisaki.

Even during summer vacation, most students were dressed in accordance with school rules on campus.

Male students wore large sleeved tunics and female students wore leggings beneath their dresses. As a rule, both men and women wore jackets on top. Their athletic uniforms had long sleeves and pants while female students wore swimsuits used for competitions that covered everything below the neck.

However, cuteness in the form of backless clothing or revealed shoulders was on full display here. Wearing sandals with bare feet was perfectly natural just as miniskirts or shorts that covered the bare minimum areas were nothing out of the ordinary.

Morisaki himself was wearing easy-going gear that included a short-sleeved tunic embroidered with flower patterns and the top two buttons unbuttoned.

However, he was wearing a vest that opened in front that concealed a CAD.

This was the singularly most out of place area.

The youth coming and going were not carrying CADs. From the onset, Morisaki never witnessed any young man wearing dark jackets or vests nor did he see any young ladies carrying thick bracelets.

Just now, he hadn’t seen a single Magician.

It seemed like Morisaki was only able to truly comprehend the cold truth just now that Magicians belonged to a decisive minority.

Furthermore, he suddenly felt that “his throat had gone dry”.

(……This must be because I was sweating a lot in the morning……)

He rationalized this as thirst.

Not far from where he was standing stood the terrace of a café.

Without further contemplation, Morisaki walked towards the aesthetically pleasing café as if in stark resistance to acknowledging his thoughts and doubts.

The rather limited capacity of the café had no empty spaces left.

Lacking further options, Morisaki could only take a seat on the terrace that only provided an umbrella’s shade from the sun. Outdoor air conditioning services were not a rarity, but this café was not equipped with one. Given the outer appearance in the style of a small log cabin and the white wood furniture, the café owner was possibly a fan of natural décor.

A certain group of people might conceive the café’s style as “fashionable”. Though there was indeed a demand of such in the market, this was wholly dependent on the time of year. As proof of this, the terrace of the café was sparsely populated.

Morisaki claimed a corner seat for himself as he held a cup of iced coffee and observed the youth on the streets in a lackadaisical manner.

He felt that most of them were young men and women about his age.

At least half of them were couples whereas over 90% of the other half were moving as a group. Less than 5% of the crowd were loners like him (though based on mood, he was more of a solitary soldier than a true loner).

An ostracized feeling gradually overcame Morisaki as he continued to observe the human beings around him when suddenly the silhouette of a young girl entered his eyes.

Just like him, she was by her lonesome self. No, the rarity of this was exponentially higher given that she was female.

She wore a sleeveless tunic with a high collar and a pleated skirt that fell to her knees while her bare feet were covered with sandals, a rather neutral wardrobe that was neither coquettish nor mundane.

Still, her features defied the term “mundane”.

Eight out of ten people, and this number would spike to nine if they were men, would rate her as a “beautiful young lady” or “beautiful woman”.

If released from the ponytail that trailed down the front side along her left shoulder, her hair would have fallen to waist length. Her large eyes that were slightly uplifted along the corners flitted about without any effort, giving the impression of a large feline on the prowl. In this case, she was a leopard rather than a tiger or lion.

Her face bespoke of an Eastern ancestry but her complexion was that of a Caucasian. Rather than labeling her a leopard, perhaps a snow leopard would be more precise (except that in reality, the snow leopard’s fur was closer to gray than true white).

She looked to be two or three years older than Morisaki.

Though her features were certainly eye catching, there were quite a few young ladies present whose appearances were more beauteous when it came down to “eye catching”. Morisaki noticed her because of her appearance, but stared at her for an altogether different reason.

(She…… must be a Magician, right?)

She was not wearing the commonly seen bracelet-shaped CAD.

Seeing the bag she carried with her, there was the possibility that she was carrying a handgun-shaped CAD, but there was no way to verify short of popping open his machine.

Her appearance gave no indication that she was a Magician, but Morisaki instinctively labeled this girl as someone connected to the magical world.

She remained oblivious of Morisaki’s gaze, or at least feigned so, as she walked in front of the café where Morisaki was sitting.

Morisaki pursued her figure with his eyes and noticed that there were others also watching her.

And not with flirtatious intent.

Helping out the family business – an “instinct” gained from his role as support personnel raised the alarm.

She was being pursued by gazes with “malice” lurking behind them.

Morisaki paid the bill using the terminal on the table and stepped away from his seat as if nothing was out of sorts.

Morisaki was not shadowing this girl due to careful contemplation on his part. Morisaki’s experiences were not profound enough to constitute a “workaholic”, but this description was the closest approximation. Truth be told, the fact that she was a beautiful (young) woman certainly had an impact on Morisaki’s choice.

This young lady (though she was probably more mature than that appellation) seemed to be on some sort of business as she departed the park area and walked towards the manufacturing streets.

Maintaining a prudent distance as he trailed behind her, Morisaki noticed that there were few pedestrians passing by. Although this direction ran counter to the park or other amusement facilities, the rate at which the pedestrians were disappearing could not be explained as mere coincidence.

Morisaki recognized that this was unnatural – as if some “unnatural” force was at work.

Morisaki was unfamiliar with Ancient Magic, but he believed that Taoism or onmyoshi arts should be able to use some sort of technique to affect the subconscious, causing people to avoid a specific location.

In other words, this was the work of Magicians. Ever since Morisaki noticed this young girl, she never showed signs of casting magic. Thus, Morisaki judged that there was someone other than her wielding magic to ward away outsiders.

Then, what was the motive behind avoiding other people?

Obviously, this wasn’t a confusion engineered to avoid embarrassment. There was no way that would be the reason.

Possibilities included kidnaping, robbery, or – sexual assault.

In Morisaki’s opinion, assassination in broad daylight was out of the question, but at any rate they were up to no good.

The next question was how many people the other side possessed. Based on the broad scale of the magic involved, there couldn’t just be one or two people behind this. Without a clear picture on the opposing manpower, direct confrontation was a choice for fools. As such, the only option was to wait for the opponents to act then catch them by surprise from the flank, temporarily immobilizing the “enemy” and seizing that opportunity to evacuate the girl from the scene.

--Morisaki decided on this course of action.

However, the speed at which the situation spiraled out of control surpassed Morisaki’s calculations.

Morisaki had believed that these miscreants – at least whom he deemed were miscreants – would wait until the young woman reached the deserted factory area before making their move.

Even if there were only a few people around, the streets were still under observation from the cameras. Hence Morisaki was certain the events would not play out according to the miscreants’ wishes once the young girl reached the (second generation) Rainbow Bridge.

Nevertheless, during the instance that the road was devoid of vehicles and pedestrians, the eyes that followed the young girl transformed into figures that surrounded the girl.

“Who…… Who are you guys!?”

The young girl screamed at the silently approaching men.

Her reaction was rather defiant. Under these circumstances, it wouldn’t be strange for even a male to be stricken with fear and unable to speak freely.

Still, based on the fact that the young woman failed to detect that there was no one else around her, she too must have fallen prey to the miscreants’ magic.

Morisaki verified that the young woman was not panicking – her state of panic would necessitate a change in plans – and raised his CAD from behind the trees that dotted the sidewalk. Sniping from concealment was not one of the Morisaki Family’s stronger suites, but from an objective perspective, given Morisaki’s traditional responsibilities as a support member in the protective agency, he should be more adept at “Flanking” than “Quick Draw”.

There were a total of 6 suspects.

He needed to take them all out in one strike to safeguard the young woman.

Cold sweat slid down Morisaki’s temple.

At some point, his breathing became shallow and hurried. Forcibly adjusting his breathing pattern, Morisaki charged out from behind the trees.

As he charged towards the young woman, he squeezed the trigger twice.

He dove forward when he saw his targets reach inside their jackets and squeezed the trigger once more in mid-air.

In lieu of the nature surrounding the “bodyguard” profession (even a side business still counted as a profession), the Morisaki Family developed a type of a magic that could bring down a target with one blow without inflicting serious damage.

He caused the targets to accelerate to the rear then immediately accelerated them forward to nullify the force. By rapidly looping this Move-Type Magic that incorporated two processes, he shook the internal organs of five of the targets – with an emphasis on the brain, causing them to collapse one by one.

By the time Morisaki took aim at the sixth target, his heart leaped violently.

Directly in front of his eyes was a silencer – the gun’s muzzle.

That was no CAD.

It was a real gun – an automatic pistol.

Morisaki had accounted for the possibility of a magical counterattack, but never expected that someone would possess a firearm.

Given their use of magic to clear the area, he had assumed that his targets would lash out with magic.

He had erected magical countermeasures ahead of time, but was not prepared to defend against bullets.

There was no time to use magic to block the bullets or shift his own body.

Morisaki redoubled the efforts in his legs and sought to escape the line of fire.

Nonetheless, by the time he gave the order for his muscles to move, the unique cough that accompanied any firearm equipped with a silencer rang out.

The muzzle was not aimed at Morisaki.

The young girl had grabbed ahold of the hand holding the gun from the side.

Morisaki pulled the CAD’s trigger.

When the sixth person collapsed to the ground, the young girl seemed to be dragged downwards as she fell to a seat on the road.

“Can you stand?”

Morisaki ran to the young girl and reached out for her hand without waiting for a response.

“We best leave here soon. At any rate, let’s head for the bus station. These guys don’t seem like they want to cause a scene.”

The young girl was indeed made of sterner stuff. Despite suffering an ambush, there was no sign of tears or hysterics. After nodding in reply to Morisaki’s words, she grasped his hand and scrambled to her feet.

“This way.”

“Thank you.”

Hand in hand, Morisaki led the young girl on a run towards the train station.

Wearing sandals with heels normally prevented running at will, but rather than being pulled along by Morisaki, the young girl was neck to neck with him (Morisaki had obviously lowered his velocity as well).

She never let go of his hand.

The soft touch of that petite hand spurred the (nominally) chivalrous spirit in Morisaki’s heart.





After reaching the bus station, Morisaki proposed that they quit Ariake, but the young girl shook her head.

“I have an appointment with someone else here.”

“Sending an e-mail message would……”

“Owing to a few pressing reasons, I am unable to directly contact the other person.”

The young girl raised her eyes and wore a slightly perplexed smile.

This bewitching smile caused Morisaki to lose the tenuous control he had over his internal turmoil.

“I am very grateful that you saved me.”

The young lady turned a blind eye to his furious blush.

Morisaki was appreciative of this caring side of hers that was altogether different from his peers.

The obligation that men held towards beautiful females – or something of that nature – burned even brighter in Morisaki’s heart.

Which is why he found it doubly hard to accept the young woman’s next words that ran counter to his expectations.

“However, I think this is far enough. Some other time…… Some other day I would like to find a way to repay the favor. If it’s convenient, could you give me your contact information?”

At this point, the young girl revealed a “dismayed” expression. Figuring something was amiss, Morisaki’s entire body tightened, but upon discovering the bashful smile on the young woman’s face, a different sort of anxiety pervaded his frame.

“Ah, my apologies. My name is Lin Richardson. I’m attending college in California and traveling at the moment. Please call me Lin.”

“I am Morisaki Shun.”

Morisaki was intensely thankful that his voice wasn’t amplified when he delivered his name, though it wasn’t like he knew who these thanks should be extended to.

“You don’t have to pay me back. After all, you bailed me out when I was in danger earlier. That aside……”

Morisaki drew upon duty as his motivation and sought to switch gears from his agitated mood (that being said, claiming that this duty arose from a more romantic motivation would be the most genteel way of putting it). When the enemy possessed the numerical advantage, loitering near the scene of the ambush was not a wise decision. Normally, they should not be leisurely conversing like so.

“I do not believe that this incident will end like this. Do you have any inkling as to the cause behind this attack?”

Seeing as the optimal decision of “fleeing” was off the table, Morisaki was trying to gather more information to devise a plan of action. For example, factors such as the identity of the enemies, how long until reinforcements arrive, etc. Protection of privacy was also one of the mandatory duties of a bodyguard, but this was subservient to necessity if that information was vital to the principal’s protection.

“I’m terribly sorry. I cannot reveal that.”

Furthermore, being unable to obtain all the necessary information was not a legitimate reason for failing to complete a protective assignment.

“Is that so……? I understand. I will not pry into Lin-san’s personal business. In turn, may I serve as Lin-san’s protection until the arrival of the person who was responsible for meeting you?”

Morisaki’s request caused Lin to widen her eyes.

“……Why?”

“This country has a saying: years of toil for a single moment.”

“I have heard of it.”

Lin’s tone sounded displeased.

“I see, my apologies……”

Morisaki awkwardly apologized, but that did not imply that he was backing down.

“I chanced upon the scene where Lin-san was almost abducted. This must be a fate of some sorts.”

In truth, Morisaki himself did not know why he was so stubborn on this matter. Lin had made her stance very clear. Even if she had not blatantly rejected him, she was hoping that Morisaki ceased to associate with her – that she didn’t want to put him at risk was obvious enough. In spite of this, Morisaki was not of a mind to beat a retreat here.

In short, the term “abduction” was based solely from Morisaki’s point of view. There was a possibility that Lin was a young lady of wealth who had gone truant and that these men were dispatched by her parents to bring her home. Assuming this was actually an “abduction”, then this may be related to a major crime and the earlier group of people may belong to an opposing organization. Alternately, they may have been sent to recapture a former member who fled the organization. Regardless, anyone who dared to directly fire their weapon without warning in broad daylight could not possibly be an upstanding citizen. This was the conclusion that Morisaki arrived at – or perhaps unilaterally decided this was so.

“……You should have realized just now that this will be very dangerous, correct? You don’t seem like a person who cannot differentiate between reality and games.”

Lin’s somewhat befuddled eyes did little to dampen Morisaki’s ardor. The other side consisted of scoundrels who were preying on a fragile, defenseless woman. In that case, it was clear which side Morisaki should support – at least this was what his heart told him.

“Lin-san is in far more danger than I am. I would not be lying or exaggerating to say that this country’s law enforcement is quite capable, but the crime rate is not zero. This is especially true for magical police officers handling magic crimes, where the reaction speed is practically lethargic.”

“The same could be said for every country.”

Lin wore an impish grin as she tried to deflect the statement, but Morisaki was not fooled.

“That’s why I believe that Lin-san needs a retinue.”

“……And you are volunteering?”

With a completely serious expression on his face, Morisaki nodded in agreement to her leading question.

“Don’t judge a book by its cover. I have two years of experience as an attache.”

“……Aren’t you a high school student?”

“I am a Year 1 student at the Magic University-affiliated high school. However, the family business manages a protection agency.”

“Oh…… Your name is Morisaki, so you must be from the Morisaki Family then?”

Lin only halfheartedly lent an ear to Morisaki up until this point before finally nodding in the affirmative. At the same time, this also implied that Lin belonged in a social stratum that was well versed with a retinue.

“But I don’t have any money on me.”

“I’m not here to talk about a job. I just don’t want to pretend not to see anything.”

“How gentlemanly of you.”

Lin laughed lightly, causing Morisaki to avert his eyes in embarrassment.

“—I understand. Since you’re so worried, then I place myself in your care.”

“—Please leave it to me.”

Altering her earlier expression, Lin fixated her eyes on Morisaki, to which he responded with a nod as if bestowed a great honor.

“Then there’s no time like the present, is it OK if I made a request right this moment?”

“What is your request?”

Bodyguards were not butlers, but in order to effectively fulfill their protective duties, establishing rapport with their principal was highly important. So long as the demand was not too ridiculous and did not affect the guard’s mission, then compliance with the principal was a must. This was one of the basic rules for bodyguards in both the east and the west – though “East Side” might be a little different. Morisaki had no idea what this request could entail so he was slightly nervous as he waited for her to continue. Lin smiled in a charming fashion before dropping this line:

“Please call me Lin. The next time you call me ‘Lin-san’ will be grounds for immediate dismissal.”




“……So Lin isn’t a Magician?”

“Yes, though I don’t know how Shun came to that misunderstanding……”

Lin smiled in confusion. In comparison to Morisaki who was struggling to lower his guard and still spoke in a stiff tone, Lin freely referred to Morisaki as “Shun” and embraced him as a friend.

Was this the poise that came with maturity?

Morisaki pondered this as he peeked at Lin’s face.

He felt that Lin was a beautiful young woman.

Normally, a person’s appearance would be beautified when observed from a distance, but in her case, seeing her from up close was just the same and may be even more bewitching. This might be due to her rich array of expressions that never appeared twice – that was the conclusion Morisaki drew from his limited life experiences.

“Ah, maybe it’s because of this?”

Lin said this as she pulled a necklace out from before her chest.

With the top button left undone, soft cleavage danced in and out of sight. Morisaki’s heart raced at this scene just as blood suffused his face, but Lin appeared to be entirely unaware.

“What is that?”

“It’s a magic talisman.”

“Ah?”

“A magic talisman. Wearing this reduces attention from other people. This was made during the age when abductions ran rampant for a variety of reasons and was crafted as a protective charm to ward against being targeted by evildoers…… It’s a bona fide artifact.”

Modern magic was created from the research and systemization of Ancient Magic. In that context, Morisaki was aware that among the objects referred to as magic talismans, there was many an “artifact” that could actually release a magical effect.

On the other hand, it was also true that fakes which were nothing more than decorations had flooded the market in numbers that were dozens of times greater than the true artifacts. Given that Morisaki was a young Magician who focused solely on modern magic, it should be no surprise that he bore a suspicious impression of objects like “magic talismans”.

Yet right now, Morisaki was not questioning Lin’s words.

Her smile seemed to dispel the skeptical thoughts being raised in Morisaki’s mind.

The question that floated into Morisaki’s brain was another one altogether.

“You’re not a Magician but you carry a magic talisman?”

When Morisaki asked this question with a perfectly straight face, Lin suddenly wore a flustered expression.

“Oh…… Well, this was something a friend gave me to ‘ward away stalkers’.”

“Stalkers…… So you ran into something like this in the past?”

“Uh…… Well, kind of.”

“Then were those guys earlier……? No, I said I wouldn’t pry. Sorry.”

Seeing Morisaki abidingly refrain from questioning her any further, Lin secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

“……Still, this doesn’t seem to work against those guys any longer.”

Morisaki’s attention was already turning to the attackers from earlier.

His diligent personality saved Lin just now.

“……Nor is it effective against Shun. Are Magicians just special?”

This question was angled in a different direction than the dialogue Morisaki was constructing.

If asked in the days of old, he would probably have puffed his chest and answered with a nod in the affirmative.

He believed he was special. His status as a Magician was a source of great pride, just as he was confident that even among his peers he was a particularly talented Magician. Although the results of the Nine Schools Competition ran counter to his hopes, he was of the belief that had the other team not treacherously broken the rules, he should have been able to achieve results befitting his own confidence without relying on that strategist who only had wily tricks up his sleeve for assistance.

However, for some reason, the current Morisaki was unable to affirm Lin’s words.

“……I don’t think there’s a great difference, since magic is a human ability after all. Lin’s magic talisman is an object that allows people to use magic powers. In that context, there’s nothing different than a Magician’s arts.”

“Hm…… That makes sense when you put it that way. Magicians are human beings just like us.”

Lin was unaware that her words formed an opinion that separated “Magicians” and “non-Magicians” into two racial groups.

Fortunately, Morisaki missed that nuance.

Morisaki was adamant about avoiding areas with few people, so the two of them ultimately spent their time in the restaurant in front of the bus station until the person Lin was waiting for made contact. The one who initiated the conversation was always Lin with Morisaki largely only agreeing with her, but neither felt the time was ill spent.

Just as Morisaki expected, they never caught sight of any suspicious individuals afterward. Yet, occasional opportunities allowed him to feel various auras watching them from a distance in all directions.

At this point, Lin’s expression suddenly tightened in anxiety as she pulled out her information terminal before Morisaki’s questioning eyes. Apparently, her point of contact had sent her an e-mail.

However, how should he explain why Lin tensed instead of relaxing when the person they were waiting for made contact? Morisaki was quite bewildered by this.

Could it be that the person they were waiting for was one of Lin’s “enemies”? Morisaki hoped that Lin was at least able to explain that to him – or perhaps come clean.

“Directly beneath the Rainbow Bridge.”

Lin spoke with a tight expression on her face.

“A boat will be dispatched to pick me up.”

“……Let’s go.”

Directly beneath the Rainbow Bridge that the other individual spoke of probably referred to the square next to the bridge’s foundations. On a normal weekday, that was a location inundated with visitors. Morisaki urged Lin to stand and reached out his hand towards the terminal set on the table’s surface.

However, Lin beat him to the punch by a hair and placed her card on top of the terminal first.

“Plainly a high school student yet you dare to pick up the tab for an older woman. Far. Too. Brazen.”

Using her index finger, Lin punctuated each word with a poke on Morisaki’s forehead, eliciting a furious blush on his part.

Lin’s originally tensed face was now exchanged with a composed smile.

Taking the main road would be faster, but Morisaki purposefully chose the winding paths leading through the park. He believed that the magic used earlier to ward away pedestrians and vehicles would have a much harder time in the park where most people stood still compared to the constantly moving flow of people on the streets.

He was not cognizant that this lengthened the time he spent with Lin.

At the very least, his surface thoughts did not venture into this territory.

Morisaki also requested that she place her necklace into her purse. Under the current conditions, spells that diverted other people’s attention would only achieve the opposite effect.

Logically speaking, this was the right idea. However – this unfortunately brought them to unexpected trouble.

Currently, a human wall was erected in front of Morsaki and Lin.

The human wall was thick enough that it could even block the free kick from a professional soccer player.

Alas, in terms of wardrobe, appearance, and all assorted factors, these individuals were a far cry from the refreshing air found on athletes. To put it bluntly, they looked more like hoodlums.

Though there might be a few minute differences here and there, the majority of them wore similar garb. Most of their naked torsos were only covered by leather vests whereas metal rings covered above and below their wrists and elbows.

Their vests reminded people of a lizard’s scales and their surface texture reflected the metallic scales that were popular three years ago among the “small crowds”. Compared to the usual bulletproof and anti-piercing fibers, this composite material boasted gigantic leaps in improvement in both protection and shock resistance. However, since the air permeability was terrible, forget wearing this outdoors in summer, even wearing this in a heated indoor environment during winter would cause someone to sweat like a horse, thereby deeming this product a failure. The overwhelming majority of the young men in front of them kept the front unzipped, though even the sleeveless vests looked to be quite warm indeed. Given that this completely defeats the purpose of blocking frontal stabs or shots, the only conclusion that could be drawn was that this was a fashion statement from the past that was stylish but impractical.

The metal rings around their wrists utilized EMS – muscle amplifiers that stimulated the muscles through electric currents. Training devices that utilized EMS were an early form of technology that existed back in the 1960s, but in the modern age, other electric currents have been introduced to successfully raise the speed for muscle contraction. These rings were normally used for medicinal purposes during rehabilitation, but could also be used to easily improve punching power, making it a popular choice among disreputable street fighters.

Several of the young men wore AR goggles over both eyes. The metallic straps attached to the goggles were covered with sensory devices which appeared to be equipped with light capture processes. These processes normally emitted a directional signal once objects approached within a predetermined distance but were not something that could be wielded at will by casual users. In short, this was also probably a fashion statement.

This martial style that emphasized physical appearance was the telltale feature of the delinquent gang who styled themselves “Fight Club”. Standing in front of the two people who came to a halt, the group of young men never stopped leering at them.

Not a word was uttered.

Morisaki slipped an arm around Lin’s shoulder and sought to retrace their footsteps.

Several people let out wolf whistles.

The human wall moved with an astonishing level of organization and surrounded the two of them in a veritable human fence.

“—We are in a hurry, please let us pass.”

“Ah hah, please don’t say that. How about playing with us?”

“Yeah, yeah, compared to that little man, we know what the really fun things are.”

Lin sought to peacefully defuse the situation, but the young men only tightened the noose while making disgusting sounds that were displeasing to the ear.

“We’re really in a hurry—”

“It’s no use, these guys never planned to listen our words in the first place.”

Morisaki stopped Lin’s continued attempt at persuasion.

“Ho ho, telling it like a big man.”

“Though it’s true that we’re not here to talk.”

Crude laughter drifted in from their surroundings.

“Little man, let’s cut to the chase.”

“Leave the job of guiding her to us, you’re free to go. Now scram!”

A young man who must be the leader of this gang changed his tone from friendly to threatening from the rear of the crowd – which happened to be right in front of these two. He was a head taller than Morisaki and the T-shirt he wore was missing sleeves that appeared to be ripped off, revealing a pair of biceps with thick muscles rising and falling. His arm was covered from hand to shoulder with silver geometric shapes which served the same purpose as the muscle amplifiers in boosting muscle contraction speed (though the results were questionable). A swarthy waist and sturdy thighs clearly denoted a physique that did not belong on someone with a passing fancy.

In response to the look that did not stretch the term ugly, Morisaki wore a light smirk on his face.

“What’s so funny……?”

“Nothing, pardon my manners.”

The young man’s low tone grew evening more threatening. However, Morisaki still wore a mocking expression as his choice of words grew scathing.

“I could understand if this was Shibuya or Ikebukuro, but I never imaged I could run into endangered species like yourselves in Ariake.”

“……What a fascinating guy.”

“You should be satisfied with blowing one round of hot air, no? We’re actually pressed for time, so could you let us pass?”

“……Looks like you need to learn a lesson in pain.”

The young man shifted his weight to the tips of his toes. Seeing this, Morsaki slightly shifted his right shoulder backwards.

The vest that opened forward moved slightly.

“Takashi-ni, this guy is a Magician!”

The movement must have revealed the handle of the CAD being held in the hidden holster. A young man to Morisaki’s right side shouted out a warning.

The circle surrounding the two of them backed off a bit. With one notable exception, they had grown fearful.

“There’s nothing to be afraid of!”

The sole exception – the “Takashi” who served as the leader exhorted his comrades onward.

“I know as well, Magician.”

The corners of his mouth twisted as he looked down upon Morisaki in a theatrical manner. This didn’t seem like bravado, so perhaps he warranted a tiny hint of praise.

“Your guys’ magic is on the same level as guns, right? You would be arrested and imprisoned if you use magic on an unarmed person, right?”

Morisaki silently looked upon the young man.

The young man continued onward with a gusto.

“A Magician who cannot use magic is nothing more than a wooden doll. What did you think that sort of empty hot air was going to do? Ah ha ha ha!”

The youth let out a foolish bray of laughter to which Morisaki returned a merciless smile up at him.

“You who face extinction, dare you put that to the test?”

“……What did you say?”

“I said, do you want to test whether we Magicians are nothing more than wooden dolls without our magic, you pretentious scoundrel.”

“Ha…… Hey, none of you interfere.”

The leader of the endangered species who styled themselves the “Fight Club” turned his face back from a jigsaw mess to his normal expression (as ugly as it was). He raised his fists before spreading his legs to lower his center of gravity, hereby adopting a fighting stance.

Seeing this, Morisaki also wiped away the derisive smirk on his face and allowed his backpack to slide off one shoulder. He raised both fists in front of his face and lightly starting hopping in place.

“Wooden doll, let’s dance.”

“I accept, superficial scum. However, you touch her at your own peril. I will make you all regret being born into this world.”

“You’re just a little man, but that mouth of yours…… Has spunk!”

That sentence served as a declaration of hostilities.

Like a whip, an upward kick was sent hurtling towards Morisaki’s face.

In order to protect Lin right behind him, Morisaki could not evade to the back.

Instead, he lowered his head to duck beneath the swirling kick.

“Takashi” adroitly pulled back the upward kick and sent the leg pummeling downwards to Morisaki’s head.

Rather than calling this a hook kick, this was more like an ax kick.

Morisaki rose in the direction of his kick and narrowly avoided the blow.

The other man’s face changed.

The moment the leg touched the ground, he immediately let fly a lightning fast punch.

Morisaki deflected it with one hand.

Forward kick, mid punch, low kick, mid kick, sweeping kick, revolving elbow…… A swift combination of attacks showed that this young man was not just shooting his mouth and his moves were not just cheap imitations. Based on these movements, he had probably undergone the entire training regime for karate under special tutelage.

Yet, all of his blows were being entirely dodged or neutralized by Morisaki.

Frustration was starting to mount on “Takashi’s” face.

He sought to decide the fight in one blow and telegraphed a long range hook punch towards Morisaki’s chin.

Morisaki was not going to let this opening pass by.

Stepping forward, he directed a left jab towards “Takashi’s” face.

No, the force behind the punch was a direct punch rather than a jab.

If his fists have not been thoroughly trained, the force of the punch might readily damage his own hand, but Morisaki never wavered and sent a well-trained right palm strike inside the enemy’s guard.

“Takashi” wavered and fell rear first onto the ground.

He was utterly astounded at being taken to the floor in two blows by someone who was an entire head shorter than he was.

Morisaki sent a mocking smile at the older man looking up at him with “disbelief” written all over his face.

“Damn, that was slow. That sort of speed might get you through a street brawl, but you don’t have a chance against us combat Magicians.”

The other young man probably could not grasp the meaning behind Morisaki’s declaration.

The young man was unable to accept a reality where a Magician who relied entirely on a cheating ability like “magic” somehow possessed greater physical prowess than someone like him who had undergone rigorous training.

In systematic magic, there were the Four Great Systems and Eight Major Types, one of which was Acceleration-Type Magic.

This sort of magic was not just used to accelerate or decelerate an object, but could also be used on the caster.

A Magician who cast personal acceleration magic would normally become accustomed to operating at the upper speed limits of what the senses can handle. This was a speed that could not be comprehended by people without magic.

In truth, the speed that professional racers experienced on the race track was a velocity that they frequently encountered at school, on the practice field outside of school, during competitions, and in combat.

Blows that professional fights would deem “fast” were practically slow motion in their consciousness.

Morisaki picked up his backpack and grasped Lin’s hand.

He had no inclination to continue dealing with the “endangered species” who refused to accept reality.

Furthermore, even though they hadn’t wasted too much time, there was no denying that this was the longer route.

Nonetheless – Lin quickly thrusted away Morisaki’s hand.

Before Morisaki’s shocked gaze stood Lin as she seemed to stare in surprise at her own actions.

The mind ground to a halt as their limbs seemed to be frozen in time.

Seeing Morisaki freeze, the young men reached out their hands towards Lin instead of taking action against him.

Grab ahold of her hand, pull her entire body over, and then press a knife against her face – that was probably their plan of action. Yet, this desperation ploy was rendered obsolete before they even reached the phase of pulling Lin over to them.

Behavior patterns that had been deeply engrained into his subconscious overcame his brain’s rigidity and spurred Morisaki’s body into action on reflex.

In a smooth motion like flowing water, Morisaki drew the CAD from his bosom.

By the time the “muzzle” was aimed correctly, the standby phase for the CAD had already been disabled.

The time Morisaki spent hesitating over using magic could be measured in milliseconds.

The young men were all struck in the head and keeled over on the ground.

Some of them fell on soft parts of the body and started to bleed, but Morisaki’s “reflex” never stopped.

By the time Morisaki recovered his wits, the only people standing at the scene were her and himself.

And one other person.

The young man who had his seat glued to the ground was spared being knocked unconscious.

Morisaki turned an emotionless eye, one that had not reawakened his feelings, on the young man.

“Y…… You damnable monster! Don’t come over here! Don’t come over here!”

The youth remained prone on the round and reached a hand into one of his pockets before plucking something out and throwing it.

Seeing that the opened switch knife harmlessly flew off into an inconsequential direction, Morisaki once more reached out a hand to Lin.

This time – Lin grasped his hand.




And so, the two of them silently ran hand-in-hand all the way to the appointed place where the boat should be waiting.

There were no further obstacles along the way. As befitting the waterside square in a park, many couples were about. Many spared a glance at the two people that had a carried a different air about them before turning their eyes away as it was none of their business.

Lin stood on the small pier where the ferries docked and looked out towards the sea. The hands that connected the two of them naturally parted here.

“……Shun.”

After a lengthy silence, Lin softly called out to Morisaki.

“What is it, Lin?”

Lin kept her eyes on the sea and did not turn her head.

“Do Magicians…… have a thirst for battle?”

Lin did not look at Morisaki’s face and made sure that he could see her face as she asked this question.

“Lin?”

“Do Magicians…… have a thirst for battle? Do they like hurting others? Do they hunger for danger? Do they desire to display abilities that normal people do not possess?”

Lin’s volume was slightly elevated, giving Morisaki the impression she was reprimanding him.

“……Are you upset?”

“I’m not upset! I’m furious!”

In short, she’s upset, right? This thought ran across Morisaki’s mind, but he wasn’t calm enough to actually retort.

When Lin turned to face him, her eyes were brimming with tears.

“……It is not because Magicians thirst for battle. At the very least, I dislike hurting others.”

Lin’s expression and the tears threatening to burst from her eyes put enormous pressure on Morisaki.

“Then why did you aggravate him?”

“Because that wasn’t someone you can talk down!”

Yet, Morisaki had his own reasons. He did not believe he made the wrong decision. Perhaps there was an even better solution, but Morisaki believed that he had also handled the situation fairly well.

“In that case, we can still flee! There was no need to defeat everyone, all we had to do was use magic to escape! We also had the option of calling for help. I don’t think that fighting was the only option we had.”

“That……”

Morisaki was unable to say anything because he knew Lin’s words made sense.

But –

“Maybe we could have ran away at the time. However, those guys might have called in more companions. Also, there is no way of knowing if the earlier crowd was going to show up either. There was no need to take on unnecessary risk, so if the opportunity presented itself to crush the enemy then it should be taken.”

--Even so, he was not going to back down.

“Why is fighting the only thing you think about! Why is it that everyone who isn’t with us is against us!?”

“Magicians are not superheroes! It’s not like in the TV dramas, where there’s a logical solution for everything!”

This principle, along with the fundamentals of the bodyguard business, was drilled into Morisaki by the uncle that was closest to him in age.

Magicians are not superheroes.

Magicians did not possess the power to do whatever they pleased.

Thus, do not hesitate when pulling the trigger.

Calmly differentiate between enemy and ally.

The techniques of the Morisaki Family and Morisaki Shun the person, neither was strong enough that they were still able to safeguard their target of protection after an enemy had launched their attack.

“—I am unable to show mercy to my enemies. I’m not incredible.”

“Shun……”

When Lin saw Morisaki gritting his teeth with a pained expression his face, the tumultuous emotion in her eyes faded.

With a warm expression on her face, she reached out and took hold of Morisaki’s hand.

“Lin……”

Morisaki allowed Lin to grasp his hand, but didn’t match her gaze as he murmured to himself.

“Do you also think…… that Magicians are monsters? Do you believe that Magicians are monsters that wield powers beyond human limits? That Magicians are able to grant any wish like Deus ex machina?”

“Shun……”

“Magicians…… are also human beings.”

“Shun…… are you afraid of fighting?”

“……I’m terrified. Regardless of whether its guns, blades, fists, magic…… I’m scared of them all.”

“Then why do you fight? You are obviously a high school student, why do you take on a dangerous job like being a bodyguard?”

“That’s because…… I possess a power that I was born to carry……”

“Shun, I don’t think that you have to do dangerous things simply because you’re a Magician or because you possess magic. Since you’re terrified, then why don’t you just stop……? Magicians are human beings too, right?”

Morisaki’s face was clearly faltering.

Terror and hope were stirred together among the maze of confusion.

With a protective smile, Lin continued to watch over Morisaki.

Amid all the couples at this location, their actions were not particularly conspicuous.

Still, based on what was about to ensue, the two of them were overly focused on the conversation.

Lin was the one who noticed that something was awry.

“Shun…… Isn’t this strange?”

“Lin?”

“I get the feeling that no one has been looking at us for a while……”

If this phrase had originated from one of Morisaki’s peers, he would have explained it as being “overly self-aware”. Yet, these words coming from someone as beautiful as Lin carried an entirely different context.

“Lin, you aren’t using that necklace, are you?”

“Ah? Yeah…… That’s why it’s so strange. I’m plainly not using that, but I feel just like as if I’m using it……”

“Lin, sorry.”

“Ah!”

Morisaki suddenly clasped Lin to his chest.

At the same time, he swiftly surveyed their surroundings.

Even after performing such an outrageous (in his eyes) motion, no one paid them the slightest heed.

No one even glanced at them.

Morisaki let go of Lin and began hunting for the hint of magic.

Although there was no way to be sure, there was definitely a vague aura enveloping them.

“What is it? What’s going on?”

“Quiet!”

Morisaki dropped his backpack and pulled out a thick bracelet from within before wearing it on his left wrist.

Then, he removed an empty holster and hung that from the pocket around the right side of his waist.

Completely abandoning the “low-key” approach, he was preparing for battle.

As if on cue, men dressed in pitch black and wearing dark sunglasses materialized all around them and half surrounded Morisaki and Lin. This was practically straight out of the urban legends surrounding the MIB.

Morisaki gritted his teeth.

He should have known ahead of time that the enemy would use mental interference magic.

(……The time for regret is later!)

Morisaki told himself in encouragement.

One of the men in black stepped in front of the two of them.

The gaze hidden behind those dark shades was not directed at Lin, but at Morisaki instead.

“……We are from the Intelligence Control Agency.”

The man pulled out a black card holder with those words.

He opened it to show Morisaki.

There was indeed the mark of the Department of the Interior’s Intelligence Control Agency inside, as proven by the special print that changed color and shape depending on the light’s refraction. Morisaki was aware that the changing shape carried a hypnotic effect so he immediately averted his gaze after verifying its authenticity.

The corners of the man’s mouth twitched upwards as he stored the document in his breast pocket.

“We will take responsibility for protecting Miss Richardson. What happens beyond here is official business, so please leave immediately.”

Morisaki was on the verge of nodding in reply when he realized Lin behind him had a white-knuckled grip on his vest.

“Lin, are you going with them?”

Lin furiously shook her head in response to Morisaki’s inquiry.

Morisaki turned his eyes forward and gazed into the eyes of the man in black – or more like his sunglasses.

“Permit me to refuse.”

His conveyance left little room for misinterpretation.

“I’ve already said this was official business……”

“This is a mission of protection, isn’t it? In that case, you have no right to override the decision of the person in question and enforce your own will on the matter. Or do you all have a warrant? Not that ‘Internal Affairs’ has the right to make arrests, of course.”

The man in black revealed a smile that said “you’ve forced my hand” and turned to look to his side.

That was the signal.

Gun muzzles appeared from the men’s sleeves.

Throwing his left arm around Lin’s waist, Morisaki used his right hand to operate the bracelet and jumped for the water’s surface.

Lin gave out a shriek.

The sounds of compressed air being fired and short needles shredding through the air were covered by her cries.

The darts from the tranquilizer rifles passed above the two figures who had leaped to one side.

Morisaki activated Move-Type Magic while in mid-air.

They stopped falling as they approached sea level and bounded to the next pier.

At the same time that he moved Lin to a kneeling position, Morisaki also dropped his own stance and set his bracelet to standby mode.

In the next instant, he had pulled out the handgun-shaped CAD from his breast.

He had confirmed 8 enemies when they had been surrounded.

Of which 2 were Magicians.

The enemies’ identities were extinguished from his mind.

The sole idea that occupied his thoughts was to protect the young woman behind him.

The notion of “escape” never crossed his mind.

His fear of battle had already faded.

Nor was he afraid of being watched by terrifying eyes.

He will strike down the enemy to protect others.

That was the only option in his mind.

First, Morisaki acted to disable the enemy Magicians and clicked the trigger twice.

Following that, one deep groan could be heard.

Confirming results. One down and the other warded it off.

Morisaki saw the enemy Magician operating a CAD with his fingers.

He also saw the muzzle of tranquilizer rifles pointed towards him.

With the speed of a stage magician employing his tricks, Morisaki returned the handgun-shaped CAD to the holster around his waist and disabled the standby mode on the bracelet-shaped CAD he wore.

He could feel that the enemy’s Acceleration-Type Magic was beginning to have an effect on him.

However, Morisaki ignored that magic.

He was calling the Activation Sequence for Area of Effect Move-Type Magic.

Morisaki used “Stillness” Magic to catch the incoming needles fired by compressed air.

Horizontal Acceleration-Type Magic rushed towards Morisaki’s body.

His feet left the ground and fell towards the water.

Lin stretched out her upper torso and called for Morisaki.

The men in black swarmed towards her.

The “gun” popped out of the water.

Holding the CAD that bore a resemblance to a handgun in his right hand, Morisaki began to float upwards thanks to the breath he inhaled earlier and aimed at the Magician to the enemy’s rear.

Magic was activated.

The “opposing” Magician was caught off guard by Morisaki’s surprise attack and struck unconscious.

Following that, Morisaki once again changed the Specialized CAD in his hand to standby mode and activated the powers set in the Generalized CAD. He sank into the water while operating the number pad and activated Acceleration-Type Magic.

Morisaki burst through the water in a manner that would turn a dolphin green with envy, no, that even a dolphin could not hope to match.

His wrists overlapped with the right hand over the left as he aimed the Specialized CAD in this manner at the enemy while turning off the power of the Generalized CAD. Pumping his psions into the Specialized CAD, Morisaki pulled the trigger six times in the air.

Morisaki was unable to completely neutralize his descending force and had to immediately fall into a roll upon coming into contact with the cement.

As his body descended to the earth, all of the men in black collapsed as well.




“Shun, Shun! Are you alright?”

Lin knelt next to Morisaki as he lay prone on the ground and desperately called out to him.

“I’m fine.”

Morisaki opened his eyes and nodded. Maintaining his current position, he temporarily regulated his breathing before sitting up.

“Ouch!”

However, he immediately fell to one knee when he attempted to stand.

“Shun?”

“It’s nothing…… I just twisted my ankle.”





By the time he said this, cold sweat beaded his temple.

Lin looked around them for help. The mental interference magic that blocked other people from noticing them had already been disabled. Many sightseers or couples out on a date were watching them from afar.

They were just watching them from a sizeable distance with an uncomfortable look in their eyes.

Their eyes were focused on Morisaki’s left hand.

On the bracelet-shaped CAD that signified his status as a Magician.

Lin knew that the people around them were whispering among themselves.

Not a single person approached them.

Morisaki gave up on trying to stand and sat down with legs splayed out.

“Lin, has the appointed boat arrived yet?”

“Huh? Ah…… I think it’s that one.”

“I see……”

A small vessel was drawing closer. It was a swift boat that didn’t draw much water and could be used either on the river or at sea.

“I’m sorry, it’s all because of me……”

Morisaki said “Don’t worry about it” to the drooping Lin.

“Forget about it, so long as Lin is safe and sound. I can finally relax now that I’ve kept my promise.”

This was not the sound of bravado, but of earnest satisfaction that welled forth from the heart.

“Why……?”

“Why indeed……”

Morisaki used a reply that was not a reply to answer Lin’s question that was not a question.

“Maybe it’s just as Lin said.”

Still, even if her question was incomplete, Morisaki largely understood what Lin wanted to ask.

“Our magic is a tool developed for battle…… We Magicians were assembled with this in our hearts, so it may be true that we have a thirst for battle and are only tools used for battle.”

Morisaki’s soliloquy seemed to have entirely abandoned his own sense of self and prompted tears to appear in Lin’s eyes when she heard this.

“I’m sorry, Shun, I’m so sorry……”

Lin burst into tears as she lowered her head and repeatedly choked out apologies.

“Lin? Why are you apologizing? Why are you crying……?”

Bewildered, Morisaki asked Lin the reason behind her tears and apologies, but his mind was calm and at peace to the point that even he was astounded.

“I’m sorry. I said something so terrible, I’m sorry……”

“Lin?”

Morisaki was flabbergasted.

He had no idea what to say.

Nor did he have any clue what to do.

Unfortunately, up until this moment, no one had ever taught him what to do under these circumstances.

“Don’t call yourself a tool. Shun always protected me regardless of the danger. Compared to those who only watch other people suffering without lifting a finger, Shun is much more humane.”

Morisaki managed to connect Lin’s broken words that came between her sobs –

--and his heart swelled with pride.

“I’m…… ashamed of myself. Just then, I was exactly like those people in that I also felt somewhere in my heart that Magicians were disgusting and were different creatures than myself. That’s why…… Shun…… I’m sorry……”

“Don’t worry about it too much.”

Morisaki’s words were spoken in a steady tone. More so than the literal words themselves, this served to help encourage Lin and caused her to raise her head.

“I am very satisfied that I was able to assist Lin. For me, today was a very meaningful day.”

Just as Morisaki had no idea what Lin was hiding, neither did Lin knew the inner struggles Morisaki was facing.

Before a rather perplexed Lin, Morisaki revealed a pleasant smile.

“Lin, the boat’s here.”

Morisaki’s words prompted Lin to turn her body.

Just as he said, the small vessel had docked. Two men wearing suites bowed deeply to Lin.

“Lin, please go ahead. I’ll be alright after I sit here a little longer.”

“Huh, but……”

“Go on. They might attack again later.”

“……I know. Shun, thank you very much.”

There was no kiss of goodbye.

To say that there were no expectations involved would be a lie, but not progressing in that direction may actually be for the better. This fulfilling “reality” would not be tarnished. Rather than pushing himself, this was how Morisaki truly felt.

The only regret he had was that he could only sit there and watch her leave.

Lin waved from the boat, to which Morisaki raised a hand from his sitting posture in response.

This was rather improper, but Morisaki felt that this was probably more like his style.




“Meilin-sama, thank goodness you’re alright.”

“Yes, that’s because that young man saved me.”

On board the vessel that had left the shoreline, Lin wore a radically different and cold expression as she called out a name to one of the men who came to welcome her and nodded in agreement.

At this moment, an older gentleman with a head full of white hair appeared.

“Meilin-sama…… To visit this country alone at a time like this. Do take heed of your position.”

“Are you giving me orders?”

“No, your subordinate dares not.”

The old man bowed respectfully towards Lin.

The older gentleman’s decorum was impeccable, but his attitude was hollow.

“Nevertheless, this country’s government appears to fight with us until the end. This time they dared to insult Meilin-sama, I believe equivalent retribution is in order.”

“I forbid it.”

The old man raised his eyes and put forward this suggestion, but Lin resolutely vetoed it.

“It’s true that the Japanese government was both barbaric and rude this time. However, from that young man, I obtained a bond of friendship that is more than enough to compensate. Since you all have chosen a person without any magic like myself as your leader, then I forbid you all from taking action against this country. If you are unwilling to accept that, then I will return to California.”

“No, let everything be done in accordance with Meilin-sama’s wishes.”

Morisaki was not arrested by Internal Affairs.

They were likely also acting beyond the bounds of law. The unconscious men in black were borne away in front of Morisaki’s eyes by their comrades. The agents from Internal Affairs who came to collect their colleagues never spared Morisaki a single glance.

As to who Lin was and why she was being targeted a government organization, no one told Morisaki the truth.

Lin’s real name was “Sun Meilin”. She was the adopted daughter of “Sun Richardson”, the head of the Hong Kong international crime ring known as “No Head Dragon” – the daughter of the leader’s most beloved mistress – and the new leader chosen by the lucky survivors, but Morisaki never had the opportunity to know that.





Amelia in Wonderland




On a certain cloudless day in the last third of August, 2095 CE.

Standing at the gates to the amusement park awaiting the arrival of her friends was a young girl whose red hair was ruby-like in its brightness and wearing a military style jacket with its many pockets and a miniskirt.

The girl’s name was Akechi Eimi, also known as Amelia Goldie, a student of the National Magic University Affiliated First High School.

With summer vacation nearing an end, the plan was to come to this amusement park to play around with some fellow first years. As they were in different clubs, normally there were few chances for them to hang out.

(It seems I’m a bit too early…)

It was still half an hour before the appointed time. That might be expected if it was a date with the opposite gender, but there was likely no one who would come this early when going out to play with friends of the same gender. Eimi herself certainly would not normally come this early. (Incidentally, as Eimi herself had yet to experience such encounters with the opposite gender, there was little meaning behind her supposition).

As for why she had ended up here so early, an international phone call she had received this morning was to blame.




It was the sound alerting her to an incoming call on her room’s video phone that drew her out from the world of dreams.

The digital clock read five o’clock.

Thinking “what a nuisance,” Eimi looked at the message window and saw that the caller was her grandmother on her mother’s side, the matron of the renowned Goldie mage family of England and effectively the “number two” in authority.

Eimi snapped wide awake.

Even if that were not the case, Eimi’s parents were unbelievable people who never rose from bed until a predetermined time, not even if a truck crashed into the house. Consequently, it was an unwritten rule in the Akechi household that Eimi, who did not use a Sound Sleeper device, would handle all early morning callers and visitors.

“…It has been a while, Grandmother.”

Eimi refrained from saying good morning.

“Because I am not properly dressed, please excuse my using voice-only with the call.”

[Good morning, Amelia.]

It seemed her grandmother was also aware of the time difference, Eimi thought as she heard the greeting.

As it was daylight savings time, the difference between here and England was eight hours. Over there, it was now nine o’clock. If one thought about the time here, to be honest, Eimi really wished her grandmother had waited another hour before calling.

[It may be very hot over there, but are you keeping healthy? Your body has never been very strong after all.]

If you know I’m not very tough, then I wish you would let me sleep a bit more, Eimi sincerely thought. Of course, she did not give voice to that wish.

“I’m fine, Grandmother. The heat wave for the past couple days has been subsiding.”

This was just some honeyed words so as to provide her elder with some peace of mind. In reality, last week’s heatwave had been absolutely horrible, though this week it was becoming more tolerable.

Summer would soon be ending anyway.

[Is that so? Don’t push yourself too hard, Amelia.]

“Yes, thank you very much, Grandmother.”

Even as she replied politely, Eimi’s head tilted to the side. Just as she was wondering why on earth Grandmother had called-

[Actually, to avoid the heat, I will be staying at the Swiss mountain villa from next week until the fall. I would be very happy if you would also come, Amelia.]

“…Me, go to Switzerland?”

The hesitation in Eimi’s response marked her awareness of the invitation’s undertones.

[Yes. I have wanted to have a nice, long chat with you for quite some time, Amelia.]

“I as well, Grandmother. There are a great many things I would like for you to teach me, but…”

But this was impossible. In a little over a week the second term would start.

While Eimi was trying to politely decline the invitation with that explanation, her grandmother was not so easily deterred.

[If you are worried about school, there is also an excellent magic school in Switzerland. It should be fine if you studied abroad for about half a year? I could handle the arrangements with the school.]

Because you’ve known the head of the Magic University for a long time is what you’re saying, Eimi thought impatiently.

No one would be surprised that her grandmother was well acquainted with the highest levels of the magic community in Japan.

With the restrictive control of overseas magic education, the chances for a magic high school student to study abroad were for all practical purposes nonexistent – at least Eimi had not heard of any such instance – but, with her grandmother, the impossible might well be achieved.

At this rate regardless of Eimi’s intent, it looked like she might well find herself studying abroad.

While somehow or another halting the discussion here with her emotional appeals was a victory of sorts, after the phone call ended, rather than relief, Eimi felt uneasy.

Though she was a grandchild of a daughter married into another family, until now her grandmother had never interfered with her life. While visits tended to require Eimi to be on her best behavior even as she was treated kindly, other than that she had been left to her own devices – until now.

Now however some reason had appeared to prompt her grandmother to want to keep her close by.

However, without having any knowledge of her grandmother’s reasoning, the endless worrying afflicted upon her head made going back to sleep impossible. As such, Eimi ended up leaving the house well before the meeting time.




“Eimi!”

When she turned her head toward the call of her name, Eimi saw the girl who was today’s sponsor waving.

“Sakura!”

As Eimi waved back, the girl trotted over.

The girl wearing the (thoroughly) goth loli-esque one-piece dress was Sakurakouji Akaha.

This girl’s name was read as Akaha, not Momiji.



On the day these two met as classmates,

Eimi: Akaha, how do you write that?

Akaha: Red leaf, the same as “autumn colors” but pronounced Akaha, you see.

Eimi: Hee? So sakura and akaha, that’s cherry blossoms and autumn colors put together. That’s a rather gorgeous name.

Akaha: But you know, it’s a shame both are rather ephemeral.

Eimi: Aha, the beauty of elegant simplicity, no?

Akaha: But you hardly seem the type to have much relation with elegant simplicity. You’re a rather colorful brilliance.

The chance to become friends came with the exchange of false laughter after their conversation, making fate rather mysterious.



“Sakura, you came with Subaru?”

“Ehehe…”

Though Eimi’s questioning had no deep meaning, Akaha began laughing nonsensically.

Eh, is it possible you actually have that kind of preference? Unbeknownst to Akaha, Eimi made a mental note regarding her.

However, as Eimi focused once more on the companion standing next to Akaha, she revised her opinion and felt that she could “understand it a little, probably.”

At a glance, there was a handsome young man wearing a summer suit. That image was only further emphasized with the sophisticated under-rim glasses.

However, in reality this youth was a androgynous female classmate.

Satomi Subaru was by way of a teammate at the Nine Schools Competition – a relatively new friend, but now, their relationship was amiable enough to allow for exchanges such as, “Subaru, you came as a deterrent against skirt-chasers?” or “Milady, it would be a pleasure to escort you.” – Moreover when in the middle of such conversations, the two would smile, no, grin without reserve.

“Is something wrong, Eimi?”

As Eimi allowed her mind to be filled with fantasies of Akaha’s inclinations, Subaru peered at her face suspiciously. Confronted with the prim and proper facial features of the handsome young man (only in appearance) staring at her up close, Eimi felt her heart racing a little but resolutely refused to let any of her thoughts surface in her behavior, replying “Nothing’s wrong” with a curt shake of the head.

“Is that so?”

Subaru’s wide grin was galling and Eimi really felt like giving her a good stomp on the foot, but doing so might end up dragging herself into an even more embarrassing situation, so with all her will she pretended not to notice.

“That’s a relief. In that case, let’s go in.”

Objectively speaking, Eimi’s poker face was rather lacking, but having said her piece Subaru turned away. Knowing when to stop was also one of her charms. However, to be considered “charming” by other girls might well be something Subaru herself would only accept reluctantly.

Without further thought on what “a relief” and “that case” was, so as no to waste any more time Eimi made no objections.

“Oh yeah, it’s been a while since I’ve been to an amusement park.”

When Eimi said this with a lively voice, “Theme park.”

For some reason, Akaha interrupted her with a displeased tone.

“Eh?”

“Theme park. Wonderland isn’t an amusement park, it’s a theme park.”

As expected from the repeat customer with the most visits on hand, it seemed Akaha could not help but be more than a little finicky about this amusement, no theme park.

“Sorry, sorry, yeah, Wonderland is a theme park.”

While Eimi felt there was little difference in either label, that very same feeling meant there was no need to stir things up. Eimi was soon correcting herself to use theme park instead of amusement park. Nevertheless, the irreverent tone and manner of the two did not go unnoticed and with half-lidded eyes Akaha regarded the them with displeasure, but with Subaru and Eimi proceeding through the gate she hurriedly chased after their backs.

With that amusing mood, the two went through the gates without having to queue and lost themselves in Wonderland.




Wonderland was an amusement park with magic as its theme.

Possibly because of that, all the interior fencing and attractions in the premises were arranged like a labyrinth. Furthermore, every attraction also served as some kind of trick house. It was very difficult to leave after entering, even if one did not try out all the attractions. Due to this kind of park layout, rather than “entering” the park, it would be better to say that visitors were “lost” in it.

And right now, a certain girl was really lost inside.

“Seriously! Forget about Local Positioning System navigation, but what’s with GPS not working either!?”

After visiting three attractions, Eimi had somehow lost her two friends and was now grumbling at a portable terminal.

[Can’t be helped, right? Isn’t that one of the park’s selling points?]

Subaru was the one receiving her vented frustrations.

“Even if that’s the case, blocking GPS signals is going way too far!”

[Relax. Is there a map display somewhere?]

Well-versed in dealing with girls, Subaru (despite being a girl herself) took an approach of gentle appeasement. As a result, Eimi seemed to put aside her annoyed emotions somewhat.

“I’ve been searching since a while ago… But let alone a map display, I can’t even find a guide anywhere.”

[Really…? Anyway, if worse comes to worst, just light some fireworks and I’ll use my magic to come pick you up.]

Subaru’s specialty was Leap magic along with inborn talent for Cognitive Inhibition (her usual flamboyant behavior was apparently a reaction to the skill of “imperceptibility”).

Despite possessing skills in Cognitive Inhibition, she was nowhere near the level of First High’s counselor, Ono Haruka, whose true identity was a Public Safety investigator. Nevertheless, it would be an effortless task for her to stroll casually in the air without attracting attention while other park visitors were focused on having fun.

On the other hand, Eimi’s personal talent what was known as Artillery Magic under the Movement System, capable of accelerating massive objects to high speed using only a short amount of time. During the Nine School Competition’s Pillars Break event, she had used her own ice pillars as bowling balls to launch into enemy territory, knocking down the opponent’s pillars all at once, thereby displaying her strong-arm tactics. For Eimi, it would not be a difficult task to replace heavy projectiles with compressed masses of air then firing them into the sky to produce explosion noises on the level of fireworks.

[Subaru, that’s not allowed. Using magic for such reasons will get us into trouble.]

However, Akaha entered the conversation on her own terminal and rejected Subaru’s suggestion.

Laws had very strict conditions regulating the use of magic. Indeed, using magic for something as trivial as kids getting lost would definitely entail dealing with the police.

[…Can’t be helped, Amy. Can you see the Sage’s Tower?]

The Sage’s Tower was Wonderland’s signature attraction and the tallest structure there.

“Yes… Just barely.”

Eimi turned her head and looked around, finding behind a hedge the pinnacle of the building, constructed from faux white stone.

[Then we’ll meet up there.]

“Okay, got it.”

Ending the conversation, Eimi glared at the Sage’s Tower viciously, as though it had killed her father--well, that might be an exaggeration, but at least the killer of a beloved puppy.




Staring at the voice communcations unit on the portable terminal whose call-inprogress light had switched off, Subaru pondered a certain matter.

“What’s the matter, Subaru?”

Naturally, this behavior made her companion suspicious. In response to Akaha’s question whose tone was split evenly between curiosity and worry, Subaru smiled slightly demurely and said,

“Hmm, nothing much… I was just wondering why Amy would end up getting separated from us.”

“Because she’s too hyperactive?”

“Hold on, that’s…”

Akaha had given a blunt answer without thinking, putting Subaru at a loss for words.

“It’d be understandable if it happened momentarily, but she didn’t realize until neither of us could get a bead on each other’s location. I think the situation isn’t very normal.”

“Hmm~ …Does Amy have no sense of direction?”

“…Umm, Sakura, you’re making me very curious how the two of you perceive each other…”





Subaru shook her head, trying to dispel the urge to sigh, then made her tone of voice serious.

“Putting that aside, Amy doesn’t have a terrible sense of direction. She’s in the hunting club and already acknowledged as a promising first year. Sure, that’d irrelevant if all she did was compete in indoor shooting competitions, but someone with no sense of direction can’t possibly hunt birds and animals in the mountains.”

Subaru’s diatribe made Akaha finally realize the possibility that “Eimi was perhaps simply lost.”

“Besides, Wonderland is a recreational facility that even children can visit to play. No matter how much it’s made like a maze, it’d be too weird if there were no clues at all for finding friends who got separated or if people who are lost cannot even find a map or a guide.”

“You have a point. Since it’s one of the park’s selling points, it wouldn’t hurt to provide some assistance in this area.”

Exchanging solemn glances, the two girls made their way to the Sage’s Tower as Subaru suggested.

“Anyway, let’s go.”




Unlike her friends who were weighted down by burdensome doubts while gradually making their way to the meeting point, Eimi was getting more and more frustrated by her lack of progress in approaching her destination, making her too occupied to think about anything else.

Currently, the tower’s pinnacle was still visible so the direction was still clear.

But whenever she tried to walk towards it, she would always encounter dead ends that forced her to find detours.

Subaru had determined that Eimi “did not have a terrible sense of direction” but that description was far too conservative.

To be more precise, her sense of direction was extremely sharp.

Eimi’s sense of direction and ability to grasp the landscape made her aware that she was simply going in circles in the same area.

Having a visible target that could not be approached, knowing the current situation yet unable to find a way out, this further magnified her frustrations several fold.

And now, a thorny hedge of wild roses was blocking Eimi’s path. Exasperated by the numerous dead ends she had lost count already, Eimi reached the limit of her tolerance.

Even a boy would have trouble crossing a hedge formed from thorned roses, so a girl would have no way of breaking through.

But Eimi was no ordinary girl.

(Watch me blow up this hedge…!)

Totally vexed, Eimi reached into the pocket of her miniskirt--more precisely, it was a hole in the skirt that looked like a pocket. Reaching for the leather holster strapped to her thigh, she drew out the long and slim terminal-style CAD.

Her main CAD was a shotgun model but that was not something to be carrying openly in the streets after all. Still, this backup CAD was more than enough for eliminating this obstruction. Usually operating gun-model CADs with one hand, Eimi used both hands to invoke the activation sequence on this CAD.

“Hold on! Akechi-san, are you for real?”

However, a voice was heard from behind as though perfectly timed. Eimi was startled as though someone had splashed a bucket of ice water on her head. The magic sequence was dispelled in the middle of its construction.

Caught in the act of using magic arbitrarily.

More precisely, it was an abortive attempt, but by this stage, Eimi’s intentions were obvious to any magician. Her actions were very unlikely to be overlooked. Also, the other person knew her identity, which made things even worse. Pondering these matters in a mental state of despair, Eimi felt cornered without any way out, even failing to realize that since it was someone who knew her, it might be possible to plead to him to turn a blind eye.

Eimi turned around in trepidation but the sight of the completely unexpected figure stunned her, rooting her to the spot.

The person who spoke to her was a short clown (short was relative to male norms, he was still taller than Eimi).

In circus performances, magic tricks were usually performed by clowns. Hence, using magic as the park theme, it was not surprising that Wonderland had staff dressed as clowns.

However, this clown was not wearing a typical baggy clown outfit. The right torso was black while the left torso was white. The right sleeve consisted of irregular horizontal stripes of black and white while the left sleeve had vertical narrow stripes of black and white. The pants were black on the right and white on the left. The vest was white on the right and black on the left in front while the colors were reverse on the back. A very peculiar outfit.

He was wearing a white glove on his left and a black glove on the right. Instead of a brimless clown’s hat, he had a wide-brimmed top hat with vertical stripes (black and white as always).

Beneath the top hat was a face with a fake expression drawn in black and white.

No, it was actually a fake face--A mask.

The right side was a crying face with black on a white background while the left side was a smiling face with white on a black background.

This eerie atmosphere, rather than a clown, was more like--

“--The Phantom?”

Eimi was reminded of a certain well-known opera character.

“Huh? Akechi-san, what are you talking about?”

The familiar voice, speaking friendly words, quickly brought Eimi back to reality.

“…Tomitsuka-kun?”

“Yes, I’m Tomitsuka-kun.”

The clown took off the mask to reveal a familiar face.

Tomitsuka Hagane, Year 1 Class B of National Magic University Affiliated First High School.

Eimi’s classmate.

“Why are you dressed like that?”

“This is my part-time job.”

Eiri asked in surprise whereas Hagane answered while slowly putting his mask back on.

“Job? Why?”

First High did not forbid students from working part-time.

What Eimi meant by her question was “Why are you working as Wonderland staff, a job that only ordinary students would pick?”

Not only was Tomitsuka Hagane a student at a magic high school, he was also a Course 1 student at First High.

He was ranked fifth in the year group for both practical skills and theory respectively. His overall grade made him an honors student ranking fourth in the entire year.

Due to his specialty in magic being unsuited to the type of events offered, he was not chosen to compete at the Nine Schools Competition. But in the realm of Martial Magic Arts where magic fighting was combined with unarmed combat, he was rumored to be the school’s number one despite his short height and being a first-year student. Eimi had no idea what being number one at First High actually meant in the real world, but undoubtedly, he was an excellent magician (to be).

Even as a “seed” or a “sapling,” those who possessed excellent magic skills would not have any trouble at all in finding short-term employment. For magicians, job openings for people with magic skills were ever present and offered better conditions than normal jobs for the most part.

Eimi could not imagine the hourly wage for a host staff in this park, but it could not possibly be higher than renumeration for magicians.

“It’s family-related.”

“…Oh I see.”

She was satisfied with this answer.

Hundred Families--Tomitsuka.

The Tomitsuka was one of the top clans in the Hundred Families. Furthermore, among magicians in the country, they were also top-class in wealth. This probably meant that the Tomitsuka family had invested in either the company managing this park or its parent company, a large construction firm. Asking him to work as park staff probably included handling magic-related situations.

If that was the case, Eimi had something to tell Hagane.

“Tomitsuka-kun, say, isn’t this going way too far?”

“…What’s going way too far?”

Eimi suddenly pointed at the hedge and grumbled angrily, causing Hagane to lean back in surprise. Although covered by a mask, his face was probably twitching slightly.

“This hedge mechanism! I don’t know anything about ‘recreating a wondrous space,’ but isn’t blocking people’s way with mobile obstacles going too far? Thanks to this design, I’ve been stuck going in circles in the same area for a while now!”

However, Hagane’s mental state was reset to a blank piece of paper after hearing Eimi’s accusations.

Hagane could not understand her.

“Hold on, Akechi-san. There’s no such mechanism in Wonderland.”

“Huh?”

Expecting to hear some kind of excuse, Eimi’s mouth gaped open in surprise after hearing Hagane’s answer.

“Doesn’t that go without saying? The design concept here is ultimately ‘recreating something like a maze’ but not actually a maze. If visitors felt frustrated, then it’s a negative effect on the performance. In the end, if visitors are unable to advance, that would lower the usage rates of park facilities, reducing revenue.”

“Eh… But…”

“Besides, this area is a construction zone under expansion. Park visitors are not supposed to enter in the first place. Even involved personnel almost never come in here during the daytime. How exactly did you get yourself lost into here?”

Eimi almost panicked from hearing the unexpected, but forced her hands and lips to move.

“If you ask me where… Basically there.”

Eimi pointed at the hedge she had just tried to blow up.

“Huh?”

“I said, I entered from there! There wasn’t a hedge there until just now!”

“…Are you serious?”

“I am very serious. Despite how I may look, I’m quite confident in my ability to grasp local geography.”

Seeing Eimi’s serious look, Hagane’s gaze suddenly turned sharp behind his mask. Staring straight at the hedge, he made a “hmm…” sound from his throat.

A mobile hedge made of thorned wild roses. From what Hagane knew, there were no such mobile obstacle mechanisms in this kind of place. Even if he had missed the detail in briefings, this area was not supplied with electricity, hence it was impossible for mechanical objects to be moving. Just to be on the safe side, Hagane took out an information terminal to confirm testing conditions in the new facility under construction--Indeed, this area did not have any operational facilities.

“…Akechi-san, I allow you to continue what you were doing just now.”

“What?”

This sudden instruction… Or rather, commanding tone, caused Eimi to react predictably.

“It’s okay, blow it up… The type of hedge Wonderland uses is an improved thornless variant so that visitors won’t get hurt even if they accidentally bump into them. As far as I know, there shouldn’t be any hedges here.”

“I see~”

Understanding what Hagane meant, Eimi restarted the magic sequence she had failed to unleash earlier.

“Then I won’t hold back… Tomitsuka-kun, you’re taking responsibility for this!”

Eimi’s magic activated simultaneously with this blame-shifting declaration.

Movement-type magic Exploder.

This was magic that caused all objects within the effective range of the “point of impact” to diverge spherically at high speed in an equidistant manner. This magic was capable of blowing obstacles that were collections of multiple objects, like debris or barricades, but would have no effect on a single entity like a wall or a rock.

But in this case, Eimi was treating every rose leaf as a different target and had set the effective range relatively wide, allowing Exploder to detonate in the very center of the hedge. Torn apart, the leaves dragged the vines with them, producing a large hole in the center of the hedge.

Eimi nodded with satisfaction and was just about to pass through the hole she had made when…

“Hold on.”

Her classmate’s voice stopped her.

“What now?”

Feeling as though he was blocking her joy in finally freeing herself from this dead end of a maze, Eimi replied in a displeased voice.

“I knew it…”

But judging from Hagane’s expression, he was not aware of Eimi’s ruined mood (that being said, his actual face was hidden by the mask) while he kept staring at the hedge wall with the hole in it.

“What? WHAT IS GOING ON?”

Eimi deliberately lowered her pitch slightly and raised her voice at the same time. Hagane finally seemed to notice her brewing thunderstorm of a temper tantrum and reacted by speaking relatively quickly.

“Akechi-san, take a look. This hedge is not rooted. Neither is there a frame for supporting the vines.”

“Now that you mention it…”

Having been stuck in Britain a number of times (for the short term), Eimi was very familiar with this type of hedge. As a semi-climbing plant, roses could not grow tall without support and were unable to form this kind of wall over two meters tall.

“Right, Akechi-san. This wall is supported by magic!”

Hagane swiftly inserted his right arm into the hole resulting from Eimi’s explosion.

Instantly, the scattered vines converged to devour Hagane’ right arm.

In terms of speed, it really was better described as “devoured” rather than “covered” by the vines. The vines, all covered with thorns acting as sharp teeth, were just about to pierce the black and white sleeve, stabbing into Hagane’s right arm--That was what was supposed to happen.

“How naive!”

However, what ended up torn apart was the magic driving the vines.

Releasing a shockwave radially, Hagane’s right arm blew apart the rose barrier.

“…What was that?”

From Eimi’s view, Hagane had simply released a psion wave.

But psions would not affect matter directly.

A wave of psions should not be capable of blowing material objects with an impact.

“Nothing much, it’s purely acceleration magic. Making the psion wave permeate through contact, I blew away the immobilizing magic that’s supporting the wall, then I activated Explosion.”

Explosion was a spell that accelerated all objects within the point of impact’s effective range to uniform speed. It was the twin of Exploder except substituting speed-type magic for movement-type magic.

In other words, during the instant when the thorned vines made contact with his arm, Hagane had used non-systematic magic to destroy the immobilizing magic supporting the wall, apparently freeing his arm by reversing the vines’ momentum before their thorns pierced his clothing.

“Gram Demolition…?”

Eimi whispered in surprise and fear. Forcibly diabling spells using the pressure of a psion wave was non-systematic magic, a type of top-level anti-magic known as Gram Demolition which hardly any magicians used.

However, Hagane shook his head with an awkward expression (that said, his face covered by his mask as before).

“Well, it’s regrettable… I’m unable to inject enough of a psion wave unless through bodily contact.”

This prompted Eimi to recall Hagane’s moniker.

His moniker was “Range Zero.” Eimi had heard of this nickname before which made reference to his nonexistent range of fire. Although it teased him for not being proficient in long-distance magic, the nickname also respected his peerless reputation at point blank range. Back when Eimi first heard about this, she had been wondering why he held this other title in addition to his family’s codename without any outstanding accomplishments. After witnessing the scene just now, she finally acknowledged his prowess.

A single touch from him would dispel any antimagic protecting the body, exposing it to offensive magic in an unguarded state. Besides, simply injecting a high-density psion wave into the human body was enough to disrupt biological rhythms, rendering the victim unable to stand properly.

“…Anyway, enough about my magic…”

Hagane had probably misunderstood the meaning of Eimi’s reticence, turning away with an embarrassed look (but because of the mask, his expression… hold on, there’s no need to repeat that anymore), whispering in a voice that was rendered even more unclear by the mask.

“We’ve got company. Is their target you, Akechi-san?”

It was anyone’s guess whether this just happened to be pure coincidence or if they decided that the fake hedge’s destruction served as the best timing, a group of men, dressed in black clothing, black hats and shades, emerged to surround the two of them.

“MIB?”

“All I know is that the park doesn’t use these outfits.”

Whether Eimi’s exasperated remark or Hagane’s casual comment, neither reflected the gradually tense atmosphere at the scene.

Or perhaps they were trying to unsettle the MIB’s intimidating aura.

But if that was the case, their attempt ended in failure.

The men in black closed in, surrounding them even tighter.

Hagane’s airs of playful bantering were gone.

For some reason, Eimi returned the CAD in her hand to inside her skirt.

Getting a strange feeling, Hagane placed his hand on his face. Instead of taking it off, he was pressing the mask against his face.

Eimi instantly understood why he did that. Under pressure, the mask would fit tigher with the shape of the face, improving visibility by presenting larger eyeholes to the eyes.

“May I ask what business do you have here?”

Hagane asked politely, presumably in consideration of his status as park staff and the possibility tha he had mistaken their relationship.

However, he had no expectations for a response.

The iron-clad rule in horror movies to incite fear was to refrain from speaking.

It applied to real life as well.

Arriving all at once, hiding their true identities, sealing off escape routes, applying silent pressure, then negotiating when the target had been worn down mentally and physically. The men in black had faithfully followed this set of procedures up to sealing off escape routes.

“Miss Goldie.”

But contrary to Hagane’s prediction, one of the men in black spoke up politely.

Instead of using “Ms.”, he was using the old-fashioned title of “Miss.”

“We have no intention of harming you.”

Although the man was speaking in English, not only Eimi but Hagane was also proficient in English conversation.

“All we wish is for you to hand over something to us. Naturally, we are not making demands without compensation. In exchange, we will provide something that you will need the most from now on.”

“I am afraid that the meaning of your message is lost upon me.”

When speaking in English as “Amelia,” Eimi was far more elaborate than when she spoke Japanese as “Eimi.” Perhaps because of that, her dignified airs made her sound almost like a different person. Despite being born in a side branch, she was still part of the prestigious Goldie family, hence such airs were perhaps quite suited to her stature.

“Pardon my poor manners. Then I shall be more blunt.”

The man remained polite but the men in black surrounding Eimi and Hagane closed in even more, exerting pressure on the two of them.

“Miss Goldie, please teach us the spell of the magic projectile, Tathlum. What we will provide in exchange is assistance in stopping future assassins who intend to harm you.”

Hagane originally thought that what the men in black wanted was profiting through kidnapping, at most.

However, the magnitude of the matter in conversation was far greater than expected, making him miss the chance to speak up or make a move.

Eimi responded to the man in black with a stiff tone of voice, but did not tremble.

“That magic is the Goldie family’s secret technique, only taught to those recognized as members of the main family. Seeing as I am living as a Japanese far away from the main family, do you truly believe that someone like me would have learned Tathlum?”

Indeed, the Goldie family, standing as one of the main authorities on Modern Magic in England, was originally one that passed down Ancient Magic through the generations. Tathlum was the trump card spell they had acquired during the ascent of Modern Magic, involving the rewriting of Ancient Magic into Modern Magic. But no other information was known apart from the fact that it used physical projectiles.

At least, Hagane--the Tomitsuka family--had not been able to find any further details.

“Rather than believe, we already know.”

However, judging from how the man in black responded to Eimi, Hagane surmised that his classmate had already learned Tathlum. As soon as he reached that conclusion, Hagane could hardly suppress the burgeoning curiosity surging in his body.

“Through certain channels, we have become privy to the knowledge that Mrs. Goldie has already taught you the spell of Tathlum.”

Meanwhile, Eimi reached an almost complete understanding of the background behind the series of events.

Her grandmother had taught that magic to her; that was the truth, but it was something that only people within the Goldie family were supposed to know. Eimi had never used Tathlum anywhere outside of the Goldie home but even if outsiders were to see her practicing the magic, they would not be able to identify it as Tathlum.

The reason why Tathlum was called a secret technique was due to its activation sequence. Ordinarily speaking, magicians could only recognize magic through their effects or potential effects. Simply judging from the result of rewriting phenomena, it was impossible to distinguish Tathlum from common movementtype magic.

But this person knew that she had already learned Tathlum, in other words…

(An internal conflict within the family… No wonder grandmother suddenly made that kind of suggestion…)

Not recent events but the matter of “early this morning.” As the center of all this, Eimi could not help but feel an urge to laugh at how rapidly things were developing.

“Miss Goldie, what are your thoughts? We have received indisputable information that there will be people posing as a threat near you. Pray forgive me for being forward, but your parents are only ordinary magicians. Their power alone is probably insufficient to guarantee your safety.”

(So if I refuse, you guys will become the people “posing as a threat near me.”)

Eimi sighed lightly.

“Why do you wish to obtain that magic spell?”

Eimi felt quite sorry for getting Hagane involved, for he was just a classmate.

“However, I know the answer already.”

These people were not going to back down quietly no matter what.

“That spell is legitmate proof of being part of the Goldie family.”

In that case, she had to give up on resolving this through peaceful measures.

“Even if someone was born in the main family, but was unable to use that spell, they would not be recognized as a member of the main family.”

Eimi reached this realization.

“Naturally, they would be deprived of the right to inheritance as well.”

As soon as Eimi asserted that, murderous intent could instantly be felt coming from the men in black surrounding them.

“That sort of thing is so easy to understand.”

Eimi switched back to Japanese and taunted, meanwhile preparing for battle.

“You decline to cooperate? --What a shame.”

The man in black also switched back to Japanese for the latter half of his response.

“Capture Miss Goldie. Light injuries are fine. Dispose of the kid.”

At the man’s orders, silver light flashed from all of sleeves of the men in black. Slender daggers, the type used for throwing, appeared in the hands of the men in black.

There was no way they were adhering to Wonderland style, but they had hidden spring-loaded knife cases in their sleeves.

Daggers served two purposes: for melee combat and throwing. These daggers in their hands were weighted towards the tip as throwing weapons. Close-range encirclement combined with throwing daggers all at once was an effective tactic against magicians.

Nevertheless, before the daggers could be thrown, the encirclement was already broken.

“Dispose of me? Oh please, don’t just decide something so dangerous all on your own.”

Before the men in black could throw their daggers, the monochrome clown had already charged at the mob surrounding them.

The clown had not approached with speed faster than the naked eye could register.

Instead, he had simply run up to his opponenent normally. Although he was fast, anyone could match his speed with a bit of training. While the leader of the men in black was conversing with Eimi, the clown had already started taking action.

He had simply evaded attracting attention, like a ghost hidden in shadows.

The monochrome masked Hagane pressed his palm lightly against the man in black’s chest.

It only looked like a gentle touch.

But the man he touched ended up flying backwards ten meters before hitting the concrete ground.

The two-toned colors of black and white swirled nimbly.

The interplay of light and shadow and the dramatic changes in brightness contributed to blurring outlines.

Hagane’s karate chop struck the shoulder of the man in black beside him.

An ominous crack was heard.

Rather than a heavy chop with the hand, it was merely a light tap--Just a gentle touch.

Even so, Hagane’s barehanded chop still shattered the humerus of the man in black’s knife-wielding arm.

“Magic Arts!?”

The leader of the men in black yelled out in shock.

“Magic Arts” was the short form for Martial Magic Arts.

Martial Magic Arts consisted of unarmed combat techniques combined with magic.

Using points of contact as the points for magic activation, it eliminated the step of inputting location coordinates as variables. This type of “contact magic” was one of the fundamental skills of Martial Magic Arts.

Probably reacting to their leader’s voice, the men in black surrounded Hagane and lowered their stances.

Seeing the men in black became more cautious--more serious--Hagane smiled fearlessly.

“Dear customers, this zone here is not open to the public.”

Pretentiously, Hagane held his right hand to his chest while raising his left arm to horizontal and stepping his right foot behind his left foot.

“I’m very sorry but I must ask all of you to leave.”

Simply going through the motions of a bow.

“Or perhaps, shall I lead the way for you all? --To the police station.”

Hagane taunted the men in black using a respectful tone of voice.

The men in black behind him slowly closed in to attack him. One man attacked, creating an opening in the encirclement. This was precisely what Hagane wanted.

Taking action to accommodate the man in black, Hagane turned around and rushed at the attacking man.

The man in black was no amateur either.

Holding the throwing dagger, he stabbed at Hagane.

Instead of targeting the head that could dodge easily, the strike was aimed at the center of the torso--the bottom of the sternum.

However, the fluttering of dazzling monochrome colors caused the man in black to lose his aim. Stepping lightly, Hagane dodged the man’s mistimed stab and landed a punch on his lower jaw.

This was not real magic but stage magic, using optical illusions of conjuring tricks to produce dizziness.

This was an experienced magical dance using the entire body, not something that could be learned in short time.

Hagane’s strange attire was not only an outfit worn as part of the theme park’s staff but also a battle outfit with practical combat considerations.

Including the leader, the men in black all had their attention focused on Hagane.

This was Eimi’s rare chance.

Eimi reached into the pockets all over her military-style jacket.

What she took out was not a terminal-style CAD.

Lifted in front of her playing cards opened in a fan shape in each hand.

Holding these cards, Eimi casually swung her hands to the side.

Released from her hands, the cards flew through the air.

Some of the cards advanced straight forward while others turned and traced out curves.

Flying faster than the eye could see, the cards pierced the clothing of the men in black, stabbing into their bodies.

Blood splattered.

No one suffered a fatal wound, but no one was lightly injured either.



“Satisfied now?”

Eimi directed her question in Japanese to the leader of the men in black.

Confronting the nonstop bleeding without flinching, it was like she had simply knocked over tomato juice or something.

“This is the Tathlum you wanted. But just by watching, the spell probably can’t be identified.”

“No way… Tathlum is supposed to use small spherical shells instead…”

The man probably failed to realize he was using English to answer Japanese.

Intense pain did not allow for awareness of such a minor faux pas.

Rather, given that he was the only one remaining standing, one should commend him as worthy of being the leader.

Nevertheless, Eimi was not impressed with this. Neither did she care.

“…So you didn’t even know something of that level? Looks like I said too much.”

Eimi’s eyeballs kept turning left and right, reflecting the fact that she was pondering how to pull the wool over people’s eyes. Most likely, she was regretting inside for “telling” them she had used the magic projectile, Tathlum. She had misjudged after getting carried away when she realized her enemy knew about Tathlum’s existence.

Whether due to resignation or acceptance, Eimi immediately switched from a troubled look to a strong and cheerful expression.

“Uh~ You’re wrong. The choice of projectile for Tathlum depends on the user’s own style. The one who used shells, I remember that was my late great-uncle who passed away last year? Speaking of which, I think he had a grandson who’s two years my senior? I’ve never met this distant cousin, but he’s probably your employer, right?”

With one hand akimbo, Eimi waved her other hand at face height while making a gun gesture, chattering nonstop with a tone of “How’s that for a brilliant deduction?” Eimi evidently wanted to dominate the scene with her presence, but unfortunately, the man did not seem intimidated.

Ultimately, he did not respond at all.

“Excuse me… Akechi-san?”

While Eimi was waiting for the man in black to respond, Hagane spoke to her in a slightly cautious tone of voice.

“Hmm?”

“That guy already fainted.”

“Huh?”

Despite being unfazed by blood, Eimi frantically ran towards the man in black.

“Hold on, answer my question first before you faint!”

“Don’t ask for the impossible.”

Eimi had rushed right before the stationary man, looking like she wanted to give him a good slap. Thinking he had to stop her if she really acted out (because further attacks could lead to death), Hagane hurried over and remarked with exasperation and relief after seeing her hold back.



“Oh… T-Tomitsuka-kun?”

Seeing Hagane next to her with a face full of exasperation--but due to wearing a mask (the rest omitted)--Eimi suddenly settled down and looked up at him in an awkward manner, grasping for the right words.

Eimi was acting almost like a different person from a minute ago. Even though this thought crossed Hagane’s mind, he felt inexplicably afraid of ignoring her, so he decided to answer.

“Yes, Akechi-san, what’s the matter?”

“Umm… Sorry for getting you involved!”

“Oh, so it’s that.”

Eimi swiftly bowed her head and apologized, eliciting a reaction of disappointment from Hagane.

“Even as just a part-timer, I am part of Wonderland’s patrolling security. I can’t pretend I never saw a potential kidnapping happening inside the park, even if I abstain from interfering. Besides, it’s clearly our fault that so many suspicious people were able to slip into the premises, so don’t worry about it.”

Eimi instantly brightened up after hearing Hagane’s answer.

Seeing her so opportunistic, Hagane could not help but smile wryly.

Feeling the tension gone, Hagane casually said something inconsequential.

“Also, I got the chance to see something rare… So that’s the magic projectile, Tathlum. A delayed spell applied with activation conditions on objects to be used as projectiles. Shooting magic that activates movement magic simply by launching by hand. I don’t know how long the delayed spell can persist, but when faced against enemies, it allows the user to fire single shots, repeated shots, or firing all at once as they please without the need to operate a CAD or construct magic sequences. I see now, it’s definitely a spell worthy of being the prestigious Goldie family’s trump card.”

Only after he finished did Tomitsuka notice the change in mood.

“…Observing to such an extent after seeing it once, rather, shouldn’t I say ‘As expected of a direct descendent of the Tomitsuka--one of the strongest among the Hundred Families’?”

“Oh? Umm… Akechi-san?”

“…How regrettable, to think we could’ve been friends…”

“Huh? Eh? Why are you using past tense?”

“Tomitsuka-kun, let me tell you some good news.”

An intense alarm sounded in Hagane’s mind.

But for some reason, his feet felt rooted to the ground.

“Uh… What…?”

“A secret technique is called ‘secret’ because it must be kept confidential at all costs.”

“Whoa~! Hold it right there!”

The cards in Eimi’s right hand opened in fan shape, causing Hagane to wave his hands in a panic at the sight.

Not only that, he also frantically took off his hat and mask.

“I won’t tell anyone! I’ll keep it a secret! Read my lips! My face doesn’t look like I’m lying, right!?”

He had apparently taken off his mask to deliver these words.

Hagane suddenly prostrated himself on the ground, causing Eimi’s pressure to plummet, unable to continue acting serious.

“…Jeez, whatever. After all, I got to see an interesting dance just now.”

“S-sure~”





This time it was Hagane’s turn to sound troubled, still kneeling on the ground.

This sound alone was enough for Eimi to conclude that Hagane did not want others to know about his type of conjuring tricks. It was probably the secret trump card that Hagane had innovated on his own. In that case, things were simple.

“Very well, let’s keep each other’s secret!”

Eimi knelt down (naturally with her legs together to prevent exposing the underside of her miniskirt) to meet Hagane’s gaze at eye level. Hagane immediately smiled shyly and nodded.

“Oh, I almost forgot!”

Probably feeling relieved, Eimi suddenly stood up and took out her CAD from under her skirt.

While Hagane watched in puzzlement, thinking “What’s up?”, she activated a magic spell.

This magic manifested its effects in the form of light, heat and odor.

The cards buried in the men in black’s bodies suddenly ignited, cauterizing the wounds before turning into ash.

“Elimination of evidence and halting the bleeding, done. Now then, part-timer Tomitsuka-kun.”

“W-What is it?”

Eimi suddenly switched to a coaxing tone of voice, naturally causing Hagane to feel wary.

But there existed many things in this world where being wary was still futile.

“Injuries occurring in the park premises means that staff is responsible for medical care, right? And if those injured people are carrying illegal weapons, it’s also the staff’s responsibility to call the police, right?”

“Akechi-san… Are you trying to shove all the work on me?”

“How dare you say that I’ve shoving things on you, of course not! But think about it, I’m just a ‘customer’ today, after all. And my friends are waiting for me.”

“…So unfair.”

Eimi remained unfazed despite Hagane’s gaze of resentment.

“Very well, that’s settled then~ See you in school, Tomitsuka-kun!”

Eimi rapidly left the scene with just a turn and a wave of apology. Watching her leave, Hagane’s expression slowly turned from a poker face to a wry smile, finally ending with a long sigh.




Eimi finally managed to meet up with Subaru and Akaha. The trio sat down to a lunch of crepes on a bench. When a member of park staff dressed in a vertically striped outfit passed by, Eimi raised a question aimed at no one in particular.

“This place is clearly Wonderland so why don’t they dress up as rabbits…?”

“Come on… Wouldn’t that lead to copyright problems?”

“Hmm? You actually want a bunny boy to serve you, Amy?”

“Of course not! Sheesh… I was just thinking, since it’s not every day that one gets to visit a land of wonderment, it’d be better if the staff dressed up to give a more immersive feeling.”

“What kind of outfit would feel more immersive?”

“Hmm~ …Lemme think, maybe magicians with Venetian style masks or something like that?”

Surfacing in Eimi’s mind was a monochrome clown akin to a certain phantom, but she had a feeling that young children would cry in fright if they saw that look, hence she searched her mind for similar images.

“Oh, that might not be bad.”

“Yes, I agree. Sounds interesting.”

Then every time park staff passed by, the girls would enjoy the fun of virtual dressing up in their minds, chatting “not like that, not like this.” Meanwhile, Eimi was secretly contemplating extremely dangerous ideas, from Hagane’s perspective, such as “it might be nice to have Tomitsuka-kun dressed up as a bunny boy.”





Friendship, Trust, and the Dubious Lolicon




Third High School, which is affiliated with the National Magic University, is located outside Kanazawa City in the Ishikawa Prefecture. Because of the wide scale shift of district lines under the current district system, it is properly called the “former Ishikawa Prefecture,” but people, including the mass media, normally refer to former prefectures and their capitals by their old names. Probably out of habit. It could be that “Ishikawa Prefecture” is also used instead of “The Domain of Kaga” or “The Country of Noto” because “it’s what we’re used to”.

It’s not really important.

In the reference room of Third High School, located outside Kanazawa City in the Ishikawa Prefecture, Kichijouji Shinkurou stopped working so diligently on his manuscript and did a gigantic stretch. He might be on the brink of ruining it by trying to improve it, so he took off the headset for the brain wave assistant interface and once again made a big arch with his back.

He’d been working longer than he’d thought; it would probably be best to make that posture again. The sound of bones cracking back into place continued; the feel of small aches and pains made Kichijouji scowl.

Since he was taking a break from writing for now, he turned his face away. There was no window in the reference room since it might potentially be used to inspect the highly confidential documents, but, perhaps for refreshing purpose, on the side of a wall in the small private room was a window-emulating display that switched between different landscapes. The “landscape” he could see from this private room was of a grove of trees deep in the mountains wavering in a gentle wind; Kichijouji was fond of this scene.

What he’d been working on was the manuscript he would use for his presentation for “The National High School Magic Theory Thesis Competition sponsored by the Japanese Magic Association” at the end of October. Kichijouji was a world renowned magic researcher as well a first year high school student, so he’d been chosen as a member of Third High School’s representatives. His personal preparations had begun before summer vacation, but ever since the Nine Schools Competition had ended, he had become overzealous about writing his manuscript — even he himself felt so.

He was also aware of the reason.

It was the rivalry he felt with that boy he met at the Nine Schools Competition, Shiba Tatsuya.

Until the Nine Schools Competition, Kichijouji had never felt that he was inferior to anyone around his own age in Magic Theory. In fact, he had almost no memories of ever feeling rivalry with anyone. Aside from the practical side of Magic, the realm outside of magic theory, in terms of owners of brains equal to his own which discovered the “Cardinal Code”, Kichijouji prided himself on being the only one in his age group whose brain was at this level not only within the country, but even if taking the worldwide viewpoint.

And, he was not being conceited. In the world of the study of magic, there were currently new scientific findings being announced day by day, but scientific findings that equaled the “Cardinal Code” were no more than once a year at the most. Kichijouji Shinkurou’s achievement was that rare and valuable.

However, his vanity had been crushed a number of times in the last Nine Schools Competition. At least, Kichijouji himself felt so.

The theoretical is accompanied by the practical, for the first time that had meaning. In the world of magic research, this was a widely supported way of thinking; in this country especially, the concept was common sense and a widely diffused premise.

Kichijouji also considered that a natural idea. Magical theory in the end is something for the purpose of using technical skills called magic; a theory that can not be put into practice is ridiculous. If the study of magic is to promote learning, then sooner or later it might advance to include the study of logical concepts to explain reality that were purely mental constructs. However, the modern study of magic was not at that level.

And, in regards to the way theory is useful for practice, the technique demonstrated by that guy, First High School First Year — Shiba Tatsuya, had carved a sense of defeat into Kichijouji’s heart. Not just knowledge, not just technique, but the power of the two unified to make him actually feel that the sum was greater than the parts.

That left Kichijouji immensely aggravated.

Knowledge and technique were the cornerstones of his self-confidence. He who could never win against “them” in power was so useful to “them” that he was an utter necessity, and another person could not outperform him. Therefore, Kichijouji pledged to himself that he would redeem himself from his loss during the Nine Schools Competition at the Thesis Competition. He considered victory over First High School at the Thesis Competition to be the shortest route to regaining his self confidence, which he needed to do.

For that reason, directly after the Nine Schools Competition was over, he spent almost every day confined in this reference room working hard composing his presentation speech.

Speaking of the aftermath of the Nine Schools Competition.

—Ichijou’s state of mind seemed a little off—

That phrase fell into Kichijouji’s ears some days rarely, some days frequently.

He made no objection to calling Masaki’s condition as off. Kichijouji himself thought so. He was also aware that it was not just his imagination. After all, Kichijouji knew the reason Masaki was “off”.

(…Despite that, there isn’t really anything I can do)

Kichijouji probably could not be attacked for not being a “true friend”. After all, Masaki was afflicted with a disease that had from old been called “a sickness no doctor can cure” and “not soothed by hot springs therapy”.

Kichijouji accepted it. Ichijou Masaki was suffering from “Love Sickness”.



“Shiba Miyuki”

That was the name of the one Masaki had fallen for.

It was inconceivable that the next head of that Ichijou clan could be tormented by love troubles — but he was. Masaki with his brains, good looks and pedigree was the type that did not have to do anything to have a pack of girls after him; the reason for his torment was not anything like him being a neophyte, a complete prude, or a sexual deviant or anything like that — there really was no reason for him not to confess his feelings and end his torment of unrequited love, Kichijouji thought.

Even he himself couldn’t keep his heart from beating faster when he recalled that girl’s image.

The girl was that lovely. Not like a flesh and blood person, if someone said she was the fantasy of a teenage boy transformed into a three dimensional image by super science, he could just about believe it. Even without relying on a photo, his brain could revive her clear image; once or twice, he had gotten the feeling that she was some sort of dream or product of some wild delusion.

Since even he who had no feelings of affection toward her was in this state, Masaki who had fallen in love with her probably couldn’t help becoming more distracted than was usual for him.

In his case, she was an unreachable goal that inspire feelings of awe. Thanks to that (probably), the matter ended without inciting hopeless feelings of unrequited love; however, in Masaki’s case, in part due to the potential of actually getting her, the illness had become unnecessarily severe.

The name of Shiba Miyuki had special meaning for Kichijouji above and beyond that of being the subject of Masaki’s unrequited love.

She was Shiba Tatsuya’s younger sister.

The younger sister of the guy he held animosity for held his friend’s heart.

The inner workings Kichijouji’s heart were more complex than he knew.




“George.”

The sun was almost completely past the western horizon with just an edge was passing through when Kichijouji turned around towards the voice that called him just as he was leaving school.

“Masaki.”

Even without turning around, he had recognized him by voice alone. Before he could turn around, the owner of the name he spoke caught up to him mid-turn.

“You’re already leaving, right? If that’s so, let’s go together.”
