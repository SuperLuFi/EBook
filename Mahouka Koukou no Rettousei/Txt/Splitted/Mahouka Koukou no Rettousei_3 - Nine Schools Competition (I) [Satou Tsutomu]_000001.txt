The Ten Master Clans




These are Japan’s strongest magician families.

The basic dogma of the Ten is to maintain an inviolable and unshakable covert government influence, in exchange of disavowing any overt political power. From twenty eight families (Ichijou, Ichinokura, Isshiki, Futatsugi, Nikaidou, Nihei, Mitsuya, Mikadzuki, Yotsuba, Itsuwa, Godou, Itsumi, Mutsuzuka, Rokkaku, Rokugou, Roppongi, Saegusa, Shippou, Tanabata, Nanase, Yatsushiro, Hassaku, Hachiman, Kudou, Kuki, Kuzumi, Juumonji, Tooyama), ten are chosen once every four years in a [Ten Master Clan Selection Session] to carry on the [Ten Master Clan] name. Those unchosen eighteen families are called the [Supporter Eighteen] and act as counsels to each of the chosen ten families. Currently the Ichijou, Futatsugi, Mitsuya, Yotsuba, Itsuwa, Mutsuzuka, Saegusa, Yatsushiro, Kudou, and Juumonji families comprise the Ten Master clans. By chance the numbers one to ten were completed, but this is the first time that occurred since the Ten Master Clan rankings were implemented; until now repeated numbers and/or missing numbers was the norm.





The Numbers




Just like the Ten Master Clans whose surnames contain the numbers one to ten, the families that comprise the Hundred Families contain the numbers eleven onward in their surnames like 1000Chiyoda, 50Isori, and 1000Chiba. The number value is no indicator of strength, but whether or not a number is in the surname means everything, and is one criterion to guess a magician’s talent. And so the magician families with their number-affixed surnames, Ten Master Clans and the Hundred Families together, are termed the [Numbers].





The Missing Numbers (Extra Numbers)




These magical families with their [Number] deprived are called the Extra Numbers, AKA the [Extra]. This was branded to magicians, at a time when they were once weaponized guinea pigs and numbers were given to [Success] samples, that did not make the cut. Now the term [Extra Number] itself is formally struck out from common use. And the magician community considers discrimination due to being an [Extra Number] a grave criminal offense.





Chapter 0




There are currently nine national magic university attached highschools throughout the state.

The first highschool is in Kanto (Tokyo). The second highschool is in Kinki (Hyougo). The third highschool is in Hokuriku (Ishikawa). The fourth highschool is in Tokai (Shizuoka). The fifth highschool is in Tohoku (Miyagi). The sixth highschool is in San’in (Shimane). The seventh highschool is in Shikoku (Kochi). The eighth highschool is in Hokkaido. The ninth highschool is in Kyushu (Kumamoto).

These are the only magic highschools in the country. It does not refer to the fact that there are only nine highschools attached to the nine national magic universities, but rather that they are the sole nine highschools teaching magic as the main curriculum.

To tell the truth, the government is more than keen to increase the number of magic highschools. They are unable to do so because they cannot secure enough mages who go on to become teachers.

The first, second and third highschools accept 200 new students a year. The other six can take another 100 each.

In total, that’s 1200 entrants. This is the limit to the new number of mages that can be produced per year. It’s approximately equal to the number of youth with eligible levels of magic that appear in the population.

But at the same time it’s thought that if more ample educational opportunities could be provided, the possibility that even more youth with late budding magical talent could be discovered is not inconsiderable.

The reality however is that the running of just these nine magic highschools fully stretches the human resources of this country. Therefore the only way to address this deficit is to take these 1200 freshmen a year, train them as much as possible, and raise their level to the max. In doing so the number of mages will gradually increase, and in the future it is expected that this positive spiral will eventually fix the dearth of teachers.

One of the measures taken for that are competitions at the school level between the nine magic highschools, to fuel the aspirations of the students. The largest of these is the summer Nine Schools Competition.

It’s a nationwide magic highschool magic tournament.

Every year a selection of magic highschool students from across the country meet, putting their pride on the line, and unfold a story of frustration and glory.

With a huge crowd including not only government officials and those interested in magic but also businesses, overseas companies, researchers and scouts, this is the greatest stage for magic highschool students to shine.

This year too, soon, the curtains of that momentous event will be raised again.





Chapter 1




The year 2095 AD, mid July.

The week after the first semester’s finals were over for the National Magic University affiliated First High, the students devoted all their energy towards preparing for the Nine Schools Competition during the summer. However, he — Tatsuya Shiba that is — was completely out of tune with such school spirit. This was partially due to the fact that his logical nature overrode his emotions. That being said, the primary reason for his being at school today was because the faculty had summoned him for a meeting in regards to his exam scores.

“Tatsuya.”

“Leo…… Why is everyone here?”

Having finally escaped from the Faculty Room, Tatsuya found his classmates Saijou Leonhart, Chiba Erika, and Shibata Mizuki waiting for him outside.

Tatsuya’s little sister Miyuki was part of the Student Council, which was currently in the middle of preparations for the Nine Schools Competition in the School Council Room, so she wasn’t there.

As if to replace Miyuki, Miyuki’s classmates Mitsui Honoka and Kitayama Shizuku were there with worried expressions.

The Faculty Room was located on the teacher’s floor, which was separate from where the students usually attended classes.

However, that did not mean students did not pass by.

-- Regardless of whether the passersby were of the same grade or even upperclassmen, everyone snuck glances over at the five people surrounding Tatsuya.

Which was only natural.

They stood out. A lot.

This was not a distinction reserved for today’s situation, this was always the case.

Tatsuya had been appointed to the Public Morals Committee even as a Course 2 student and, through his numerous accomplishments during recruitment week, had proved that his selection was no fluke, ultimately resulting in his fame spreading across campus. While his single-handed annihilation of the terrorist organization had not been publicized, his outstanding success during recruitment week was enough to garner quite a lot of attention from his classmates and even female upperclassmen.

Erika was a publicly acknowledged beauty.

Owing to her constant proximity to Miyuki and Erika, Mizuki’s appearance seemed to pale slightly in comparison. That being said, her elegant and refined beauty was rated quite highly among male upperclassmen.

Despite being constantly ridiculed by Erika (or maybe “constantly bickering with” would be better), Leo’s Germanic features and superb athletic abilities identified him as “someone worth noting” among the female population. (The “pure Japanese style” that Leo referred to would be black-haired and black-eyed.)

As for Honoka and Shizuku, they were two superb students even among the 1st Year Course 1 students. Their appearance would easily qualify within the boundaries of cuteness (Strictly in terms of appearance, Tatsuya would be the most mundane).

Whether they wanted to or not, a group that transcended the Course 1 and 2 boundary and socialized together naturally drew extra attention.

Even so, possibly because this cohort’s 1st Year Representative, Student Council member and far famed beauty Miyuki wasn’t here, there were actually significantly fewer onlookers than usual. --

The people who paid these glances no heed whatsoever were unexpectedly close by.

For example, this man right here.

“It should be us asking what you’re up to, right? Why did you get called to the Faculty Room?”

Hearing Leo’s question, Tatsuya immediately understood.

It appeared that his friend was concerned on his behalf. For a moment, Tatsuya contemplated fabricating a reason to divert them, but he changed his mind upon reflecting that they deserved his honesty.

“The teachers interrogated me about the technical skills portion of the exam.”

Hearing this, Leo squinted his eyes in displeasure.

“……‘Interrogated’ sounds a tad suspicious. So what did they ask about?”

“Long story short, they wanted to know if I was tanking the test.”

Erika was the first to express her outrage at Tatsuya’s answer.

“What the heck? Tatsuya-kun doesn’t benefit in the slightest for doing that. Only a moron would ask that.”

Erika’s observation was not wrong, so Tatsuya could only smile back wryly. It was another story altogether if someone cheated to get a higher score, but there was no point in intentionally getting a lower score. This suspicion was just as ridiculous as Erika surmised.

“However, I can understand why the teachers think this way.”

“Why?”

Shizuku’s soft words bewildered Mizuki.

“Tatsuya-kun’s scores are just that astounding.”

Tatsuya did not preen at Honoka’s answer, but being overly humble might elicit a negative reaction as well. Unable to decide between the two, Tatsuya could only smile wryly again.

For First High, the final exams for magic high schools included magic theory examinations based on recall and technical skills examinations.

On the other hand, language arts, math, science, sociology and other mundane topics were graded based on daily homework. This was an institution that focused on high quality training for Magicians, so from the school’s perspective, having the students focus too much on subjects outside of magic was redundant. (Tatsuya and company made the distinction between Magicians and Magic Artificers only because their training naturally branched out in two directions. Normally, society would lump Magic Artificers into the same category as Magicians, but would not use “Magic Artificers” to refer to Magic Researchers who could not use magic.)

In terms of magic theory, the mandatory classes covered the foundations of magic learning and magic theory on the test; two additional topics were picked from the electives: magic geometry, magic languages, magic botany, and magic architecture, as well as one selected from either magic history or magic systems theory, for a total of five topics.

Magic technical skills were measured through application ability (the speed of magic design), magic tolerance (the scale of the Magic Sequence), interference ability (strength of rewriting Eidos), as well as the combined Magic Power given from the culmination of all three, thus resulting in four scores.

Students with superlative scores would have their names and ranking publicly announced on the campus website.

The 1st Year students’ results had already been announced.

Those who had earned the highest combined scores between magic theory and technical skills were completely as expected.

First Place: Shiba Miyuki.

Second Place: Mitsui Honoka.

Third Place: Kitayama Shizuku only a few points behind.

The first three were all names from Class A, and it wasn’t until Fourth place that a male student named “Tomitsuka” from Class B appeared. Beyond that, familiar names included Morisaki at Ninth Place. The first twenty spots were all Course 1 students.

A glance at the Technical Skills portion would yield the same result. While the placements swapped around a little, the first twenty places were still occupied by Course 1 students.

Strictly speaking, First Place was Miyuki, Second Place was Shizuku, Third Place was Morisaki, Fourth was Honoka. Combined score notwithstanding, Class A dominated the Technical Skills portion to the extent that it caused their teachers considerable headache (Class distribution was supposed to be split evenly through A to D, so this sort of academic showing obviously revealed that Class A grasped the materials for the first semester much better than the other three).

However, when based solely on the Magic Theory portion, an entirely different and astounding picture revealed itself.

First Place: Class E Shiba Tatsuya.

Second Place: Class A Shiba Miyuki.

Third Place: Class E Yoshida Mikihiko.

Honoka was fourth, Shizuku at tenth, Mizuki at seventeenth, Erika in twentieth, while Leo and Morisaki fell out of the rankings.

When separating Course 1 and 2 students, the difference in technical skills played a heavy role. However, the general consensus was that students that scored poorly on technical skills would also have a hard time grasping the theory as well. Because of all the complex concepts, it was very hard to understand the theory without perceiving it firsthand.

Even so, two of the top three were Course 2 students.

That alone was an unprecedented situation, yet Tatsuya’s accomplishment was even more amazing. His average in the theory portion — not the total — was easily a dozen points higher than the second place score, leaving him in sole and undisputed possession of First Place.

“Even if theory and technical skills are two different things, there should be a limit.”

“But I don’t believe Tatsuya-kun would tank his score.”

After Shizuku objectively expressed her opinion, Mizuki countered back in a displeased tone.

“Of course Shizuku knows that.”

“But the teachers aren’t like us, since we know what kind of person Tatsuya-kun is.”

Honoka and Erika both started to smooth things over.

“Yeah, they only know us from the other side of the terminal screen……”

Just as Leo said, this was a major deficiency in modern education. Even if modern teachers personally came to the lecture hall like teachers from the previous century, it still wouldn’t guarantee that they could fully understand their students.

To address this problem, the school had created opinion boxes to replace last century’s office hours system.

“……How about asking Haruka-chan?”

Counselors handled the situations where students were unsatisfied with the school or other on-campus incidents. Discounting whether the label “Haruka-chan” was appropriate, the suggestion itself bore merit, but Tatsuya sharply shook his head.

“I talked with Ono-sensei yesterday. In truth, she informed me about all the major questions they would ask today.”

“Such an unreliable teacher.”

“Don’t be that way. New counselors don’t possess much in terms of authority anyways.”

It was Tatsuya’s turn to smile gently and comfort the irritated Erika.

“……Tatsuya-kun must’ve been even harsher than me, right?”

As Erika guessed, Tatsuya’s words were considerably more confrontational.

“Whoa?”

Erika’s precise retort caused Leo to elicit a strange noise.

“……What is it?”

Erika squinted as she asked.

“This woman is actually capable of saying something serious.”

Leo widened his eyes as he softly muttered to himself.

“Silence!”

Erika smacked him with a rolled up notepad.

As a matter of fact, even in an age where digital information was so common, notepads were still prevalent. Especially for magic-based schools, during the teaching of magic languages, the very motion of “writing” was in itself an important act. Since teachers primarily used pictures and diagrams in magic geometry, using a notepad to record the drawings was vastly easier compared to using a terminal, so magic high school students were more likely to carry notepads than students from normal schools. That being said, the exact reason why Erika carried around a notepad despite not being in class remained a mystery.

“Ow……”

Leo was unable to dodge the incoming blow from the notepad and crouched down, holding his head in pain. It wasn’t like he was just sitting there taking the hits without trying to resist, but currently, Erika’s smiting speed was much greater than Leo’s evasion speed, so in this situation, whenever he unilaterally decided to butt in, he would be unilaterally smote.

“……You violence addict, my head isn’t a drum!”

Leo lodged a serious protest, which was casually ignored by Erika.

Probably due to the fact that this scene had endlessly repeated itself over the last three months, Mizuki only let out a helpless smile and left them to it, rather than panicking like she had in the beginning. Also, she used this to redirect the tangent back to the original topic, avoiding any possible escalation of the conflict.

“Tatsuya-kun, did you solve the teachers’ misunderstanding?”

“Well, yes, on some level.”

“On some level?”

At Mizuki’s concise question, Tatsuya supplied further details with an unwilling expression on his face.

“The teachers understand that I wasn’t intentionally getting them wrong, but they still advised me to transfer.”

“Transfer?”

“Why? Why would they do that?”

Mizuki and Honoka both shouted out with their faces completely pale, while the other three wore similar expressions.

“Among the Nine Schools, Fourth High is renowned for their specialty in Magic Research, so the teachers suggested I transfer there. I declined, of course.”

Two people let out sighs of relief, while two others looked furious.

The former two were Mizuki and Honoka, the latter Leo and Erika.

The last member of this conversation wore an unreadable poker face.

“……So if someone doesn’t excel in technical skills, then they should join a school that doesn’t emphasize technical skills at all. Isn’t that completely self-contradictory for a school? I can understand if someone’s grades were bad and they couldn’t keep up in class, but that’s obviously not the case with Tatsuya.”

“Probably because he’s an eyesore. Maybe Tatsuya-kun knows more about magic than the teachers themselves.”

“Relax, you two.”

If left alone, Leo and Erika would only feed off each other’s fury, so Tatsuya stepped in to extinguish them.

“It’s just as Leo said, barely passing is still passing, so there’s nothing that would necessitate a transfer. It’s possible that the teachers only had my best interests at heart. Regardless, even if that was the case, these best interests possess no empathy, and are solely in place to protect themselves.”

Tatsuya’s soft tone did nothing to cover his acidic assessment, causing the originally furious pair to shrink away. This was precisely the cooling effect that Tatsuya aimed for, though the method may be called vile. But alas, the result was not the most ideal.

“At the end of the day, I think that teachers shouldn’t be mistaken in the first place.”

Just as everyone was hesitant towards what to say next, Shizuku spoke up in a singular manner that was neither supportive nor critical. From the way her comment relaxed the tension caused by Tatsuya’s mocking words, the overall effect would probably be categorized as supportive.

“Fourth High doesn’t scoff at technical skills, but when compared to the combat-centric magic that would be expressed in the Nine Schools Competition, they are more interested in further intricate techniques. The more complex the procedures the better.”

“Is that so? Shizuku-chan, you know quite a lot about this.”

“That’s because my cousin studies at Fourth High.”

Hearing Shizuku’s answer to Mizuki, Honoka and the other four people said “So that’s how it is” as they nodded. Given that this came from a student attending Fourth High, this should be a reliable source of information.

As everyone professed agreement to these words, they also sprouted considerable mistrust towards the teacher that summoned Tatsuya.

However, this group of individuals wouldn’t focus their attentions on a stranger (the teacher) who wasn’t with them at the time.

“Speaking of which, it’s almost time for the Nine Schools Competition, right?”

Leo probably recalled what Shizuku was saying earlier, to which Tatsuya nodded at his inquiry.

“Miyuki is already complaining. There are a lot of things to account for, including vehicles, tools, and uniforms.”

“Isn’t Miyuki-chan also participating in the competition? That sounds tough.”

Mizuki wasn’t being overly polite, but she was honestly concerned on Miyuki’s behalf.

“However, Miyuki should be able to cruise during the newcomers’ competition, so the preparation work should be more intensive.”

Erika replied in a manner that half supported and half refuted the earlier sentiment.

“Don’t be overconfident. The scion of the Ichijou Family started attending Third High this year.”

Shizuku’s objection was a little off the mark. The official and newcomers competitions in the Nine Schools Competition were separated by gender, so there was no way Miyuki would go against the young master from the Ichijou Family.

That being said, no one intentionally retorted at this.

“Is that so……?”

“You say Ichijou, as in Ichijou from the Ten Master Clans?”

From their heartfelt expressions of surprise, this appeared to be the first time Erika and Leo found out that someone in their year was descended from the Ten Master Clans. Mizuki didn’t seem too astounded, maybe she knew something about the “scion of the Ichijou Family”.

“That might be a tough opponent. That being said, Shizuku you sure know a lot.”

“Shizuku is a die hard fan of ‘Monolith Code’, so she watches the Nine Schools Competition every year, right?”

Honoka, who knew Shizuku as well as she knew herself, answered Erika’s question.

“……Hm, yeah.”

Hearing Honoka answer for her, the normally expressionless Shizuku nodded in slight embarrassment. Honoka owed Tatsuya a favor, so it wasn’t surprising for her to be interested in Tatsuya. However, Shizuku was different; she only knew Tatsuya because her best friend Honoka was interested in him, as well as the fact that he was Miyuki’s older brother. Initially, Shizuku had only commented from the periphery, but gradually she had lowered her guard and started expressing herself openly.

“Now that you mention it, besides the All-Japanese and the International University Intramural, ‘Monolith Code’ can only be seen at the Nine Schools Competition.”

Standing diagonally across from the embarrassed Shizuku, Tatsuya nodded upon hearing Honoka’s answer, wearing an expression that signified that he understood that sentiment.

The Nine Schools Competition was an inter-school competition between high schools affiliated with magic universities. In other words, it was an internal competition that happened to be open for public viewing.

That was because the Nine Schools Competition was one of the few stages that provided magic competition as entertainment.

Every year, a total of 1200 students entered their first year at the nine magic high schools.

In comparison, there were anywhere between 1200 and 1500 young men and women of age 15 every year who developed enough magic talent to be accepted.

In other words, for the youths that manifested magic talent, if they aimed to become Magicians or Magic Artificers, almost every single one of them would enter one of the nine magic high schools.

Hence why the magic competitions at the high school level, besides kenjutsu, martial arts, and a few others, were completely monopolized by the nine magic high schools.

In order to allow the general public to better understand and become invested in magic competitions, as well as to further society’s acknowledgement of magic, the Nine Schools Competition had become one of the few major events to propagate these ideas.

“Our toughest opponent this year is going to be Third High, right?”

“Probably.”

Knowing this to be Shizuku’s area of expertise, Erika specifically asked for her opinion. In response, Shizuku simply nodded happily.

“And this year you’re not in the audience, but one of the contestants, right?”

Shizuku was Second Place in technical skills for their year, so even if the official roster hadn’t been publicized yet, Shizuku was like Miyuki in that they were guaranteed to be selected.

“Yeah……”

Hearing Mizuki’s question, Shizuku quietly nodded in response, her face illuminated with motivation.




After finals were over, Tatsuya spent almost every afternoon in the HQ of the Public Morals Committee.

Immediately after summer vacation, the election for the new Student Council President would be held.

After a new President was elected, a new Public Morals Committee would be selected, along with its new corresponding Chief based on the new elections.

According to tradition…… More like according to bad habits, there had never been a smooth transfer between Chiefs of the Committee. More often than not, the unorganized activities record and current members were tossed to the incoming Chief to handle.

-- That being said, after Mari took over as Chief during her first year, there would be no problem with the transfer the following year. --

However, the 2nd Year students in her Public Morals Committee had insufficient experience, so Mari wished to minimize the confusion during the transfer of power between Chiefs.

—Regarding all the documents necessary for the transfer, Mari tossed that responsibility to Tatsuya.

“I’m starting to think I’m a goody two-shoes……”

“A goody two-shoes that’s bad to the core? I think this dual nature of yours is quite interesting.”

“…………”

This comment was overly pertinent, rendering Tatsuya unable to reply.

“However, this time I’m very grateful for your good side, since without your help, we would only be repeating past disasters.”

Mari comforted him in this way probably because she felt a little guilty seeing Tatsuya silently plugging away at his work.

Yet, Tatsuya did not possess split personalities, nor was he merely helping to organize the material. He was the only one organizing the materials.

These words achieved no comforting effect whatsoever.

“Even so, you’ve started preparing for the transfer very early?”

Tatsuya asked a piercing question without stopping his hands from their work.

The documents he was preparing would be completed in a week.

If no further input of additional details was needed, this would create a two month buffer zone.

Also, there was no guarantee that major events or incidents would not occur during this time period.

This wasn’t the type of material that should be created as soon as possible.

“Once we start preparing for the Nine Schools Competition, we won’t have the time to compile this. There’s a mountain of things to do, from verifying the roster, training, adjusting equipment, gathering and analyzing data, to devising strategies.”

All these things had nothing to do with Tatsuya.

“……When is the Nine Schools Competition going to be held?”

That being said, cutting off the conversation here would be awkward, so Tatsuya focused all his attention back onto data organization as he asked this.

“Ten days, from August 3rd to the 12th.”

“That’s quite a long time.”

“Hm? You’ve never seen it?”

“Yeah, since I’ve always been busy with errands during summer vacations.”

Tatsuya’s answer thoroughly confounded Mari.

“But according to Mayumi, your little sister goes to see it every year, to the point that she even remembers what events we competed in……”

Tatsuya almost burst out laughing.

“No, it’s not like we’re attached at the hip 365 days a year…… Occasionally we move separately as well.”

“Eh? ……No, that’s true. It’s just that whenever we see the two of you, it’s like you’re always with each other.”

“Speaking of which, we’re usually on our own at school.”

After Tatsuya objectively pointed this out, even if Mari’s expression revealed her incomprehension, she nevertheless still accepted it.

“If that’s the case, no wonder you were completely lost when I started talking about the preparations for the Nine Schools Competition.”

“Yes, to be honest, I don’t even know what competitions are being held. I only know about ‘Monolith Code’ and ‘Mirage Bat’.”

While it was true that he was multitasking between making conversation and creating the data files, this only served as a refresher for Tatsuya. And for Mari, who was currently idle — or more like the one who didn’t want to do anything — this was a good way to pass the time, so Tatsuya was more talkative than usual.

“That’s because those two are the most famous……”

Mari tilted her head, as if she didn’t know where to start. She held her fist before her mouth, as if she were about to cough (but didn’t actually make the coughing sound).

“The contests in the Nine Schools Competition focus on the events in athletic magic contests that require more Magic Power.”

“This I know.”

Tatsuya replied without stopping his fingers from working.

“In the past, they would change the events every competition, but recent years have seen the same contests every year.

There are six contests: ‘Monolith Code’, ‘Mirage Bat’, ‘Icicle Destruction’, ‘Speed Shooting’, ‘Crowd Ball’, and ‘Battle Board’.

Kenjutsu, Chinese magic martial arts and other combat related contests, as well as athletic competitions like gymnastics and basketball are held at a different event.”

“Don’t ‘Crowd Ball’ and ‘Battle Board’ rely heavily on physical abilities?”

“Yes. Magicians are only human, so there’s no reason to undervalue physical capabilities. Even in 1 on 1 duels between Magicians, there are cases where the individual with the superior physical abilities has emerged victorious. I’m sure I don’t need to elaborate on this point.”

“That’s true.”

Tatsuya knew this very well, so his agreement with Mari’s words was truly heartfelt.

“Of the six contests, only ‘Monolith Code’ is a team event, the other five are solo acts.”

“Isn’t ‘Crowd Ball’ a two man show?”

“This is where the Nine Schools Competition gets evil. In order to emphasize the importance of Magic Power, this contest has a solo performance rule. I have a booklet that summarizes the rules. Want to take a look?”

“Sure, I’ll take a look later.”

Tatsuya stopped typing and accepted a small booklet from Mari.

“Huh, a hard copy. How strange.”

“Anything related to the Nine Schools Competition wouldn’t be surprising. Virtual terminals would hurt the Magic Power’s conceptual foundation. On the other hand, besides Magicians, there are very few people that actually use substantial terminal devices, and the number of Magicians using virtual terminals has also increased.”

“I see, so that’s why the Nine Schools Competition uses hard copies instead of terminal devices.”

“Eh? So Tatsuya-kun prefers the usage of virtual terminals?”

She probably heard the critical elements in Tatsuya’s undertone.

With Mari’s normally brash manner and her amusing tendency to be “poor at organizing”, it was easy to forget that she was a very perceptive individual.

Tatsuya took this under consideration and selected his words — without stopping his typing motions — more prudently.

“There is some basis that virtual terminals negatively impact Magicians that have not reached maturity. Especially for students under twenty that are still developing their power, I think they should avoid using virtual models. But for adult Magicians whose Magic Power has been fully developed, I don’t feel that there’s any reason to stop them from using virtual models.”

“……That’s another way to look at it. Forcing adults to abandon the efficiency gained from virtual models simply because it poses harm to children seems a little overkill.”

There was a brief lull in the conversation. Tatsuya was busy reviewing the information he inputted on the screen, so he had no way of discerning Mari’s current expression, but he guessed that she would be considering his earlier comment.

No matter how ridiculously she usually acted, there was no way for her to disguise her inner sense of righteousness.

For some reason, that fact caused Tatsuya to smile a bit.

“……We’ve drifted off topic.”

Mari seemed to have arrived at some conclusion of her own, before she turned the conversation back to the Nine Schools Competition without any forewarning.

“The competition is separated into the Official and Newcomers Divisions, each requiring 10 men and women, for a grand total of 40. Only 1st Year students may participate in the Newcomer Division while the Official Division has no restrictions. That being said, each contestant may perform only in two contests, so no 1st Year student has ever competed in the Official Division. Even if it weren’t in the rules, there’s no way for 1st Year students to stand up against the firepower of a 2nd or 3rd Year student.

Until last year, the Newcomers Division was not separated by gender, but from this year onward, both the Official and Newcomers Division will be. Also, until last year, no 1st Year female student had to compete in multiple contests, but that may be unavoidable this year.”

Mari’s words were out of concern for Miyuki, which was obvious without naming her aloud.

Continuously participating in magic competitions was extremely taxing on the female body. Even though Miyuki had undergone training beyond that of a normal person, her physical stature was by nature more feeble. It would probably be best that he provided as much aid as he could, Tatsuya thought.

“Of the six contests, four are not gender specific. ‘Monolith Code’ is men only and ‘mirage Bat’ is women only…… Since ‘monolith Code’ is the only event where live combat is guaranteed, it’s not surprising that the event is men only.”

Mari might have been saying this, but her facial expression clearly didn’t agree.

According to the information Tatsuya gathered from the Public Moral Committee, Mari’s magic specialized in anti-personnel combat, so she must have resented being excluded from this particular event.

“The maximum number of participants per contest is three from each school, with men and women calculated separately. So for both the Official and Newcomers Divisions, five men and women have to select two of the five events while the other five can participate only in one.

As for deciding who competes in which events, that is based on whether skilled contestants should only focus on emerging victorious in one event, or maximizing profit by applying for two events, and then there is considering where the opposing aces will go, and who they will go up against…… Since this is a team-based competition, all of these details are very important.”

“Of course.”

“Besides the contestants, the Nine Schools Competition allows each school to bring four people as tactical advisers, but not every school takes advantage of this option. Our school always brings the maximum amount of personnel each year, but schools such as Third High opt to waive the tactical support when competing, relying solely on their contestants to decide their tactics.”

“Yet, ironically, they are our toughest opponent.”

“We’ve only lost to them twice, once three years ago and the other time seven years ago. The Nine Schools Competition switched to a summer format ten years ago. Since then, there have been 9 competitions. Our school has been the champion five times, Third High twice, and Second High and Ninth High have each won once.”

“I believe this year’s goal is for a three-peat?”

“That’s right. For us 3rd Year students, securing the championship is the true victory.”

Currently, the 3rd Year students at First High were known collectively as “the strongest era”.

Saegusa Mayumi, Juumonji Katsuto, Watanabe Mari.

Two of them were directly connected to the Ten Master Clans, while the third possessed similar talent.

Just the fact that all three of them were in the same year at the same school was an amazing coincidence. In addition, the campus also boasted several students that were qualified for Rank A in high school (they were unable to obtain their licenses due to limited experience, but their raw ability alone was sufficient for their ranking based on international standards).

Even before the official roster for the Nine Schools Competition had been announced, First High was already seen as the favorite to repeat as champions.

Even if the underground gamblers were using the Nine Schools Competition as a setting, no one was taking odds for First High. That was how overwhelmingly powerful their group was.

“I hear that if everything goes according to plan, our school’s victory is a foregone conclusion?”

“Probably. There are no concerns on the contestants’ end. Even taking the Newcomers Division into consideration, as long as there’s no major mishap, we should win off the points from the Official Division. If there were any real concerns, I’d say it would be engineers.”

“Engineers? You mean people responsible for CAD maintenance?”

“Exactly, except the official term from the Nine Schools Competition is Technicians. The CADs used at the Nine Schools Competition must be universally adaptable, so only models that fit the criteria are allowed. On the other hand, there are only restrictions on the hardware itself, there are no restrictions on software. How well individual CADs can be synchronized to the appropriate contestant and whether the maintenance can bring out the contestant’s maximum potential are absolutely decisive in determining victory.”

How fast an Activation Sequence initialized was entirely reliant on the CAD’s hardware, but the efficiency of Magic Sequences was heavily influenced by the design of the CAD’s software. Given that a single second could spell the difference between victory and defeat in athletic competitions, a properly devised software program was of vital importance.

By no means did this imply that the more intricate the design was or the more processes that were used, the better the software became. Software that surpassed the processing power would cause more harm than good by obstructing the hardware itself.

Given that there was a glass ceiling for hardware, the selection and allocation of software became even more important.

Tatsuya believed that, under these conditions, the competition results could change dramatically based on the engineers’ skills.

“Right now, there’s a dearth of talented engineers in 3rd Year when compared to qualified contestants. Mayumi and Juumonji are capable of maintaining their own CADs so they won’t have problems during the competition, but……”

“……”

In other words, Mari did not excel in this category.

Tatsuya accurately read the inference behind Mari’s vague words but, precisely because he understood, he chose to say nothing.

He allowed his attention to drift away from Mari’s small talk and focus back onto the data files.




Improvements in central control of public transit had led to the complete overhaul of the trolley system, with trolley cars becoming the primary source of public transportation within the city proper. The cars on the tracks were completely controlled by a central operating room in order to ensure safety, ease of access, and the ability to combat the high volume demanded.

On the other hand, the advancement of the public transportation system had not proceeded as planned. The program for connecting all the highways had already been inputted into the system, but most of the normal roads and expressways within city limits were still controlled by the city and had not reached a national level.

In comparison, the AI for driver assistance had improved dramatically.

As long as they hadn’t been illegally modified, modern cars were incapable of causing accidents even if they tried. (Katsuto’s car was able to directly impact Blanche’s HQ because that was a military model.)

Vehicles exported to other nations also possessed the same AI system, allowing smaller countries to also benefit from this system even though they didn’t have the capability to develop it themselves, which in turn lowered the frequency of accidents even further. From an international standpoint, individual control systems trumped central control systems.

Despite this, there was still a price to pay. New drivers — or to put it bluntly, bad drivers — wouldn’t run the risk of causing accidents, but it was easier for them to cause traffic jams. Even if consecutive crashes could be avoided, there was no avoiding situations where everyone slammed on the brakes, so this result was only natural.

To prevent this — at least on the outside — even if there wasn’t a pressing need for safety, driver’s licenses were still mandatory.



Next to his new electric bike, Tatsuya was waiting for his little sister to arrive.

Tatsuya had purchased this bike after obtaining his license in early April. Though the purchase was strictly for practical purposes rather than for joy rides, the bike had still accrued considerable mileage. Even so, Tatsuya regularly maintained the bike every day, so even after two months, the bike was still in mint condition.

“Onii-sama, sorry for the wait.”

Upon hearing the voice, Tatsuya shifted his gaze over as the headlights illuminated his sister’s slim body.

Miyuki’s long hair was done up in a bun while she wore a biker’s suit in the same fashion as Tatsuya’s own. The custom fit suit hugged her curves, hinting at the fullness of her womanly charms.

As Tatsuya put the helmet on Miyuki’s head, Miyuki smoothly lifted her chin. His little sister’s seemingly natural motion caused Tatsuya to wryly grin, but he still buckled on the chin strap for her.

Miyuki shrank her neck as if ticklish, to which Tatsuya responded with a smile as he put on his own helmet before climbing aboard.

He took out his goggles, then motioned Miyuki to hold on tight.

Tatsuya verified that Miyuki was holding on to his waist and that she was pressed against his back before adjusting his goggles and raising the output of the continuous motion device (equivalent to the gas pedal of motor vehicles).

The electric bike that the siblings rode sped away beneath the night sky.




Their destination was Yakumo’s temple.

However, the one training tonight was Miyuki and not Tatsuya.

Miyuki had already been selected as a participant in the Nine Schools Competition, so additional preparation was necessary.

The events in the Nine Schools Competition heavily emphasized the need for magic talent, but at the same time did not wholly ignore physical characteristics. In the “Battle Board” event, contestants with faster reflexes and a better sense of balance held the advantage, while the “Crowd Ball” event required a good balance between tactics and stamina.

For Miyuki, who excelled in Speed and Freezing Magics, “Icicle Destruction” was almost specifically designed to show off her talents. Forget the Newcomers Division -- she could probably cruise to victory even in the Official Division.

However, with the individual contests split by gender causing the number of events to increase, Miyuki was also going to participate in the “Mirage Bat” event, where she would have to “use a bat to split open the balls of light floating in the air”.

Miyuki also received martial training from Yakumo alongside Tatsuya, so her frail frame belied her superb physical status. Even so, given that there weren’t many opportunities lately for her to exercise, this training served as a precaution for the main event.

Tatsuya turned off the engine near the entrance before pushing the vehicle into the temple. After leaving the vehicle in the temple garage, the two of them went to greet Yakumo.

At this hour, Yakumo should be doing night training with his disciples.

Just as they expected, as they approached the darkened dojo, they could detect various concealed presences, as well as the occasional footstep that couldn’t be completely muffled and the sounds of bodies hitting the floor.

Tatsuya slowly pried open the ancient doors to avoid distracting the disciples from training.

Even though the door opened without a sound, a kunai still came flying towards them. Tatsuya used the blade-proof and bullet-proof jacket to deflect it before pulling out a lead ball concealed in his biker suit and firing back.

However, Tatsuya’s “marble” (a type of concealed weapon that is hurtled using finger force alone, from the same system as “point ball”) didn’t seem like it hit the target.

“Tatsuya, it looks like your marbles haven’t improved much. Don’t think magic is enough to cut it. You need to practice your projectile weapons as well. However, you made the correct decision in deflecting the kunai rather than catching it.”

There was no detectable presence, only the voice.

Tatsuya didn’t aim right in front of him where the voice came from, but instead fired a second marble towards the rightmost wall.

“Oh ho?”

Accompanying this surprised shout, a force rippled outwards from the spot Tatsuya aimed at.

Tatsuya quickly put an arm around Miyuki and sprang backwards.

A split second later, a pitch black sword wave slashed down vertically from the ceiling above, barely missing Tatsuya’s back by a hair as he covered his little sister.

Tatsuya quickly stepped forward with one foot.

A bokken[1] painted completely black was rendered completely still with Tatsuya firmly stamping on it.

Yakumo abandoned the idea of striking a second time as he let go of his immobile weapon.

“……Sensei, you have such an interesting way of greeting people.”

“……I should be the one saying that. Wasn’t your marble filled with killing intent?”

Master and disciple faced one another in the darkness, before simultaneously breaking out into evil laughter.

Tucked inside Tatsuya’s bosom, Miyuki was blushing furiously. Thankfully, that was difficult to discern in the surrounding darkness — at least that was what Miyuki thought, but Tatsuya had already noticed due to being in contact with her stiff body, while Yakumo had detected this through her erratic breathing.




Somewhere within the temple, illuminated by torches in the four corners, in a place usually reserved for homa ceremonies (this temple should have been under Hisanyama’s jurisdiction, but Tatsuya and Miyuki had never seen Yakumo chant sutras or pray to Buddha), the area was faintly lit by blue light, with orbs glowing with a dim red light softly dancing in the sky.

Because this was a temple, any ignorant passerby may have mistaken this scene for the presence of spirits, but fortunately there was no one else around.

A slender, long shadow passed through the blue light, and one orb of light vanished into nothing.

Two orbs, three orbs; the difference in color started to increase.

That mesmerizing figure was chasing the floating orbs at an energetic and unexpected pace, then swiftly bisecting them with the short rod in her hand.

After splitting thirty orbs, Tatsuya signaled Miyuki to take a break.

The interior only contained a square barrier drawn with quicklime that measured about 11 meters on the side. The raw power necessary to form a barrier by only drawing four white lines was nothing short of astounding. Tatsuya brought a large tea cup towards where Yakumo was standing as he brought down the seals.

Normally, Miyuki was the one responsible for bringing tea to the panting Yakumo, but Tatsuya took over that duty today.

That was because tonight, Miyuki was in a similar state (to Yakumo), as she stood on the other side of the white line.

“Sensei, thank you. Not just for lending the location, but also for training my little sister as well.”

After handing the tea to Yakumo, Tatsuya bowed deeply in gratitude, to which Yakumo nodded generously.

“There’s a colossal difference between attacking illusions and striking actual targets. Miyuki is also one of my cute students, so there’s no way I would decline to help.”

There was probably too much emphasis on the word “cute”, but Tatsuya decided to let it slide until after the Nine Schools Competition.

Illusion magic was one area where “ninjutsu” excelled, to the point that the speed, accuracy, and movements of the illusions surpassed those created by modern magics. Modern magic had the advantage in terms of speed of activation and variety of spells available, but within specialized parameters, there were many areas that could not compare with Ancient Magic.

Tatsuya only had access to a few magics, so he was unable to use Yakumo’s illusion “Will O’wisp” to replace projectors.

“Miyuki, should we stop here?”

Tatsuya asked as he handed a drink to his sister who was still panting, but Miyuki shook her head and took a sip to wet her throat.

“If sensei is okay with it, I want to continue.”

“I don’t mind, though shouldn’t Tatsuya also give ‘Will O’wisp’ a try?”

“No, I…… will pass.”

Tatsuya could approximately guess the reason behind Yakumo’s smirk.

Tatsuya briefly entertained the idea of spoiling Yakumo’s fun, but refrained after taking into account that Miyuki’s training took precedence.

“Is that so? Eh, oh well.”

Yakumo revealed a truly regretful expression, but that wasn’t enough to hide his mischievous smirk.

Seeing this, Tatsuya was certain that declining the earlier offer was the right choice.

Yakumo transformed his evil smirk into a kind and approachable smile as he turned back to face Miyuki.

“Then let’s begin.”

“Yes, sensei.”

Miyuki bowed to signal that she was prepared to continue.

Tatsuya had long since recovered their respective tea cups.

Just as Miyuki stood in the middle of the square anchored by bonfires and Yakumo was about to start casting illusions……

“Who’s there?”

Another person’s presence entered the scene.

The one who called out was Tatsuya.

No, the order was actually reversed.

To supplement the training, Tatsuya linked his sensory ability to the information dimension, allowing him to quickly catch wind of a foreign element being introduced into the area. The moment Tatsuya challenged the silent patch of darkness, another person’s presence abruptly materialized.

“Ah, Haruka.”

Yakumo greeted the presence in an unconcerned manner.

Tatsuya and Miyuki were both familiar with this name.

The figure that walked into the flickering light possessed a much more mature aura than Miyuki.

She was the counselor from the Magic University affiliated First High — Ono Haruka.

Likely due to the fact that she was wearing the same dark bodysuit that Miyuki was wearing, it seemed that the curves of her chest and waist were more accentuated than usual.

As Miyuki followed the direction of Tatsuya’s gaze, a trace of concern flashed across her features. However, before she could nudge her brother with her elbow, she noticed the cold, steely gaze in her brother’s eyes and swiftly regained her composure.

The reason why Tatsuya was carefully scrutinizing Haruka’s body was to ascertain Haruka’s physical capabilities.

“Tatsuya, no need to be so wary. Haruka is also one of my students.”

“But you weren’t nearly as kind during my training as compared to Shiba-kun.”

Haruka’s voice was slightly mocking, which jarred against her dangerous appearance that could easily be swallowed in the darkness.

“That being said, I know that sensei is another story, but to think that I was discovered by Shiba-kun, has my technique regressed so much?”

“Haruka, lying to yourself isn’t a good habit. If you lie too often, you will lose track of your own thoughts as well.”

“Shiba-kun said the same thing to me.”

“Oh, looks like I said something unnecessary. Anyways, let’s set this aside for now. Haruka’s cloaking was almost perfect, so there’s no need to stress about that. If you really think that your skills have regressed, that is.”

Haruka revealed a model perfunctory smile and accepted Yakumo’s hinted gaze.

She shouldn’t be able to get off that easily, nor should she have planned to do so in the first place.

Seeing Yakumo’s smirking expression, this was probably how the two of them normally interacted.

“Tatsuya didn’t detect your presence normally. He has a pair of special ‘eyes’ that are different from ours, so if you want to fool him, you need to disguise your presence rather than try to hide it.”

“I see…… I’ll take that under advisement.”

“It’s your turn to answer my question.”

The two of them were acting out a master and disciple discussion using Tatsuya as the subject. Unable to harness his irritation, Tatsuya intentionally broke in with a displeased tone.

“Hm…… It is unfair to give only Haruka information. You don’t mind, right, Haruka?”

Yakumo intentionally let out a “Hm……” sound to create an opening, but given his current attitude, it was obvious that he was calculating when Tatsuya would interrupt them. In response to Yakumo turning the conversation towards her, Haruka immediately shrugged her shoulders and replied,

“Even if I said no, you guys would probably discuss this when I’m not here, right?”

Essentially, Haruka had already given up on hiding.

“Since the person in question has given her consent, then I’ll go ahead…… Haruka is an investigator for Public Safety.”

Yakumo’s explanation was very simple, as just this alone would be sufficient. Even so, Tatsuya hoped that Yakumo would take it a step further.

“Hm? You don’t look very surprised.”

However, Yakumo posed a question of his own.

It appeared that he was expecting the Shiba siblings to be astonished.

Not just Tatsuya, but even Miyuki accepted Haruka’s real identity without batting an eyelid, which surprised Yakumo considerably, or perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that it disappointed Yakumo considerably.

“I have my own information network, so I know that Ono-sensei isn’t military. Ruling that out, the only possibilities were Public Safety (Police Department of Public Safety), Internal Affairs (Cabinet Agency of Data Supervision), or foreign spy.”

Tatsuya’s answer caused Yakumo to furrow his brows.

“Rather than saying information network, it’s more like ‘he’ provided you with that information. Is that okay?…… Given his position, he may be dishonorably discharged for leaking confidential information to a high school student.”

That being said, Yakumo’s perfectly calm expression clearly showed that he wasn’t overly concerned.

“In terms of position, sensei is roughly the same…… So, Ono-sensei is Public Safety’s undercover agent in the guise of a counselor to investigate the anti-government activities centered around Blanche within the First High campus, did I get that right so far?”

“No.”

Tatsuya asked this to verify his hypothesis regarding Haruka.

But Haruka responded with the definite negative.

“It’s true that I’m Public Safety’s undercover agent, but I didn’t disguise myself as a counselor. In chronological order, my current superior approached me while I was thinking about becoming a counselor, and I became a special investigator for Public Safety after I arrived at First High. Two years ago, I spent one year under Yakumo-sensei, so Tatsuya-kun is actually my senior.”

“Even though you only studied for one year, your cloaking ability is quite proficient.”

“That is my magic specialty, even if I can’t use any other magic. This is also the reason why my superior rates me highly.”

“……I see, you’re a BS (Born Specialized) Magician?”

“I dislike that term.”

Haruka pouted and turned her head like a young school girl throwing a tantrum, causing Tatsuya to break into a smile.

BS Magicians, also known as BS ability users, could also be called innate ability users or innate magic specialists. This was because they excelled at a particular ability, but because of this extreme specialization, they were unable to use magic techniques like other Magicians on the same level.

As could be seen from the malicious label “the 101 tricks of BS users”, BS Magicians occupied a lower social stratum than normal Magicians, but their unique ability was practically impossible for other people to imitate. Even if someone could accomplish this, they were unable to replicate the same level of quality BS users were capable of. If properly matched with their specialty, they often outperformed the generic “omnipotent” Magicians.

“Rather than being a jack of all trades, I’d rather be a master of one. However, that’s a matter of Haruka-sensei’s perspective.”

As soon as Tatsuya said this, he realized that the student and counselor positions had been reversed. However, given that this was off campus and they certainly weren’t in class at this hour, this shouldn’t have been a problem.

Probably noticing the same thing, Haruka stopped her tantrum, but she was still unhappy with the situation.

“Shiba-kun, this was a special circumstance, but my identity as a secret investigator remains highly classified, so please don’t tell anyone else.”

Tatsuya’s immediate reaction was that there was little meaning in doing so.

If she was only an undercover agent for Public Safety, the Ten Master Clans would know anyways.

Erika, whose family had close ties with the police, likely knew already.

Likewise, Tatsuya had long since caught on to the fact that Haruka was an agent of some kind, he just hadn’t been certain which organization she was affiliated with.

It was entirely possible that Haruka was the only one who believed her identity was a secret, but Tatsuya didn’t verbalize this.

He merely replied to the request in this fashion:

“I understand. I’ll keep it under wraps. Though it might be presumptuous to ask for this in return, but if something similar to what occurred in April is on the horizon, could you let me know the details ahead of time?”

“……That’s fine. Let’s go with that mutually beneficial relationship.”

The two of them shook hands, each nursing their own agenda.




It went without saying that besides magic, magic high schools still fielded a full curriculum.

This included physical education, which involved using competition to light the flames of youthful ardor to ridiculous levels, a scene that had yet to change.

Today’s class activity was football.

The encyclopedia’s entry was as follows: This is a sport derived from soccer, with similar rules, that is played on a field surrounded by a large box with numerous tiny holes in it. The only notable differences are that players wear a head protector, and head and hand contact are prohibited. (Also, the competition format where players “compete in a transparent box” was one of the defining characteristics of post-2080 AD athletics.)

Occasionally, this contest was also held with magic involved, but generally magic was ruled out, and today was no exception.

Football was played with a lightweight, highly resilient ball that bounced off the walls and ceiling. The ball rebounded left and right at high speeds, much like a ping pong ball, as players chased after it in order to make the shot against the opposing goal. It was a sport that demanded both incredible agility and considerable strength. In addition, the highly stimulating exercise was a popular sport for “entertainment”.

The female students from 1st Year Classes E and F were currently taking a break and, completely ignoring their own curriculum, were busy cheering on the male students.

“Move, move, get outta my way!”

Leo was charging towards the ball that no one was covering.

The ball used in football was highly dynamic, so it was extremely difficult to dribble with it, hence that action was rarely seen. Generally, the five players on a team used the walls or ceiling to make passes, so the energy expended by recovering the ball often decided victory or defeat.

“Tatsuya!”

Crossing the entire field, Leo passed the ball to Tatsuya in midfield with the force of a shot.

If he tried to trap the ball with his chest or abdomen he might be knocked to the floor, so Tatsuya kicked the ball directly upwards, allowing the ball to lose some its force from the rebound on the ceiling before trapping it neatly beneath his foot.

After receiving this pass with machine-like efficiency, Tatsuya sent the ball careening off the wall, using the rebound to pass the ball.

Along the axis of the rebound stood another slim youth. Rather than calling him slender, he may have been more accurately described as well-built. Currently, he fearlessly received Tatsuya’s high-speed pass in one motion.

And immediately shot on the enemy goal.

The electric chime signaled the goal, accompanied by the cheers of the watching female students.

“That guy isn’t bad.”

Leo bluntly praised the youth as he stood next to Tatsuya.

“Yes, accurate prediction of the flight path, and his appearance belies his agility.”

Tatsuya was faintly surprised by the boy’s physical abilities which surpassed his expectations. They had been in the same class for 3 months, so today wasn’t the first time they were in physical education together. Tatsuya previously believed that he had an accurate grasp of the boy’s abilities on some level, and his earlier pass was adjusted accordingly, but this person’s — Yoshida Mikihiko’s — actions showed that he was more than meets the eye.

There were a mere 25 students in class, so it was natural that everyone knew each other’s names.

Also, Tatsuya knew more than just a name.

Yoshida Mikihiko came from a prestigious family renowned for Ancient Magic — he was a direct descendant of the Yoshida Family.

The Yoshida Family possessed an Outer-Systematic Ancient Magic called “Spirit Magic”, and it was rumored that they passed on their traditional methods of training as well. Given that it was a traditional method of practice, arduous labor was probably at the center of it. If so, members of that family would naturally possess highly capable physical specifications.

The cause of Tatsuya’s surprise was that Mikihiko’s appearance gave no hint of this whatsoever.

Specialists that excelled in concealing their power always pop up in the most unexpected places……

With that in mind, Tatsuya sent the incoming pass spiraling towards the enemy goal.

With Tatsuya and company dominating the floor, their team easily cruised to a crushing victory.

Tatsuya returned to the observation area and sat down with Leo near Yoshida Mikihiko.

“Nicely done.”

By the time Tatsuya spoke up, his breathing had become perfectly even.

“You guys as well.”

Just like Tatsuya, Yoshida Mikihiko’s breathing wasn’t ragged.

Tatsuya hadn’t formed social links with every classmate, likely because his personality was the type that usually ignored others. This caused a portion of his peers to see him as a cold individual, so only about half of 1st Year Class E was willing to converse with him. However, Mikihiko was even more extreme in his aloofness and, including himself, Tatsuya had never seen him speak with any of their mutual peers. On enrollment day, he was the first one to leave the classroom by himself. Even Leo, who moved in social circles much broader than Tatsuya had, only nodded to Mikihiko in passing until now.

“Yoshida, you’re pretty good. Don’t take this the wrong way, but I was quite surprised.”

Mikihiko’s performance seemed to have reminded Leo of something, so he asked Tatsuya — Tatsuya extended the greeting first, but it was Leo who had suggested it — to sit near Mikihiko.

Leo’s welcoming tone might have caused some people to think he was being overly familiar.

“Mikihiko.”

That being said, it seemed that Mikihiko warmed to Leo’s direct attitude.

“I don’t like it when people refer to me by my family name, so just call me by name.”

Before, he never replied in such a friendly manner.

“Okay, then call me Leo.”

Even if the number of those full class activities from the previous generation had decreased, it was still strange to have this sort of conversation 3 months into the school year.

Mikihiko’s school life was just like that, caused by the towering wall he erected between himself and the rest of the class.

Maybe this was only brought on by the exhilaration following strenuous exercise, causing him to be in a more generous mood, but this most definitely was an excellent opportunity.

“May I call you Mikihiko too? You can of course refer to me as Tatsuya.”

“Okay, Tatsuya.”

Mikihiko replied in a comfortable tone, but his expression was slightly embarrassed.

“Actually, I wanted to talk to you a long time ago.”

Impressions are a curious thing. Sometimes first impressions are impermutable regardless of what you do, but other times a single sentence is sufficient to dramatically change an impression you held until this moment.

In Tatsuya’s mind, Mikihiko’s impression turned from “anti-social” to “shy”.

“What a coincidence, that makes two of us.”

They entered the school as Course 2 students — replacements, but were still able to secure the top and third scores in their entire year. Even if the school emphasized technical skills, it was impossible for the two of them not to take interest in the other.

“……Somehow, I feel excluded.”

The thing was, first ignoring the fact that Mikihiko didn’t know them very well, Leo didn’t think Tatsuya was interested in this classmate solely on the strength of his scores. Rather, Leo noticed that there was something odd between the two of them, thus leading to the feeling of exclusion.

However, Mikihiko’s next sentence swiftly dispelled that notion.

“Leo, you worry too much, I wanted to talk to you too.”

The reason was not because of any real conversation, but because Mikihiko was at heart a kind person, as could be seen from his comforting words.

“No matter how you slice it, anyone with the patience to deal with Erika is a rare find indeed.”

It was Mikihiko’s turn to emotionally express himself.

“……That’s a little hard to swallow.”

Leo’s face grew longer the more he heard Mikihiko talk about Erika like they were a couple, which caused both Tatsuya and Mikihiko to burst out laughing. However, Tatsuya had a few reservations about Mikihiko’s comment as he recalled the reason why Mikihiko drew his attention in the first place.

“So Mikihiko, you knew Erika a while back?”

There was no ulterior motive behind this question. So when Tatsuya saw Mikihiko’s “Uh oh!” expression, he quickly changed the subject.

“Kind of, I guess we’re childhood friends?”

“Erika, why the question mark at the end?”

Given that the person in question was present, Tatsuya’s concerns quickly faded.

“We met when we were ten, so technically we’re not childhood friends. To top it off, not only has he been avoiding me in class, we haven’t seen each other outside of campus for the last six months.”

Erika’s answer to Mizuki’s question suddenly thrust her into the middle of Tatsuya and company’s conversation.

“Hey, Tatsuya-kun, what do you think?”

Afterwards, Erika suddenly sought Tatsuya’s opinion in her usual as-she-pleased manner.

“This should count as childhood friends, right?”

On some level, given the way Tatsuya responded with no hesitation whatsoever, the same charge could be leveled at him.

Yet, the reason why Leo and Mikihiko were unable to utter a single word wasn’t because they were struck speechless by Erika barging in without any consideration to others. Their widened eyes clearly testified to this point.

In 2095 AD, fashion and proper decorum demanded that any trace of exposed flesh be covered in public. Since school was considered a public environment, even if it was in summer, women were still obligated to wear jackets and a colorless, impenetrable pair of tights or leggings beneath their dresses.

That being said, these rules didn’t apply to athletic uniforms, so athletic clubs suffered no penalty or criticism for revealing their hands or legs with their uniform, and physical education classes were also not bound by this rule. For example, Tatsuya and the other male students were currently wearing shorts that did not extend to their knees while Mizuki was wearing a fairly long pair of rhythm pants, which was the standard uniform for physical education.

On the other hand, Erika was……

Both of her legs were completely uncovered.

From the thighs down, everything was revealed to the sweltering summer air. Her pants had no length to speak of whatsoever. Finally, the T-shirt she wore barely extended over the pants, giving the impression she was wearing only her underwear.

Her tight thighs showed no signs of coarse muscle; their reddish tint caused by the sun only served to embellish and accentuate their original white caliber.

“Erika, why are you dressed like that?!”

Mikihiko finally reclaimed his wits as his voice spiked, though the unavoidable blush on his face had nothing to do with the UV rays the sun was giving off. There were plenty of opportunities to see a pair of legs outside of school, so it wasn’t like Mikihiko was a complete prude, but the “coquettish” air that Erika’s legs were giving off was enough to cause almost any of her male peers to lose their composure.

“What? This is the traditional women’s athletic uniform.”

It was obvious with a single glance what state Mikihiko’s mind was currently in, except Erika never mentioned it at all as she tilted her head sideways and replied back with a surprised expression on her face. It certainly didn’t look like she was dressed like that solely to tease her childhood friend.

“That’s traditional?”

That being said, the man of the hour thought this was all to tease him, as could be seen from Mikihiko’s face that colored even more in fury.





“Is that so? I thought this was some unique design for the rhythm pants.”

Tatsuya interjected to change the pace and to prevent Erika from unintentionally pouring more fuel on the fire.

“This isn’t a pair of rhythm pants.”

Saying this only changed the victim from Mikihiko to Tatsuya, but one glance at Tatsuya’s stoic face was sufficient to tell that he far surpassed Mikihiko in composure and patience. No, it might be more appropriate to say that Tatsuya wasn’t sensitive enough to fall for Erika’s provocations.

“But, these aren’t tennis briefs either, right?”

“Even I’m not interested in wearing just the briefs and not the skirt. These are called bloomers.”

“Bloomers? Sounds like brooms. Did they used to wear those while cleaning?”

“Don’t be stupid! Didn’t I just say these are athletic uniforms for women?!”

It was difficult to tell if Tatsuya was intentionally playing ignorant, which put Erika in an awkward position.

“Speaking of bloomers, are these it?”

Leo finally came around.

“During the Age of Immorality, when female high school students received allowances from middle aged men to……”

……However, regardless of whether it was for him or Erika, this was undoubtedly a bad time for Leo to recover.

“Idiot, shut up!”

Beet red, Erika exploded in outrage. At the same time, she raised one foot and furiously kicked Leo in the shin.

Leo bent over and grabbed his shin in pain, while Erika pranced around holding one foot.

This verbal and physical exchange looked to have ended in mutual defeat.



Compared to the earlier — Tatsuya and company’s — contest, this one went back and forth.

Both sides repeatedly claimed the lead from the other.

The two teams were of equal strength, but were restricted to the caliber of high school students.

There were very few female students watching, since they had their own lessons and could only ditch for so long. On top of that, physical education classes differed from magic technical skills class in that most physical education classes had instructors available. (The difference in raw number of teachers available between magic classes and normal classes could be seen here.)

“I can’t believe you. Is your brain stuffed with that type of nonsense?”

Now, only Erika and Mizuki were present to watch the boys’ contest.

“Shut up, that’s what the books say.”

At Erika’s scornful look, Leo realized that his position was rather bleak, so he replied rather flippantly and never dared to look her in the eye.

Not striking someone while they were down was one of Erika’s merits.

“I have no idea what books you’re reading…… Speaking of which, Miki was looking at me in the same way. Is this really that arousing?”

Maybe she was just easily distracted.

“Erika…… I think you’d be better off wearing rhythm pants too.”

Given Mizuki’s reluctant tone, she probably belonged to the “I think but can’t say” category.

“That’s true…… It’s not as flexible as I imagined, and a little too tight too.”

At that, two male students quickly turned around, but thankfully Erika didn’t notice.

“Hm~. When I dug this up in the cabinet, I thought that no one had worn this and the measurements were perfect, but I think I’ll go with Mizuki’s suggestion and change back to rhythm pants.”

“Yeah, I think that’s for the best.”

This wasn’t exactly what Mizuki was aiming for, but she nodded in emphasis regardless.

“Hm?”

Mizuki was half a beat late on the uptake, but from a certain perspective that suited her personality perfectly.

“By the way, Erika, who is ‘Miki’?”

With his head still turned, Mikihiko’s shoulders grew tense, but Erika didn’t notice as she leisurely pointed at his back. (Even if she did notice, would she have opted for a different action? This remained a profound mystery.)

“Because he’s Mikihiko, hence Miki.”

Mikihiko spun around almost at the same time Erika uttered those words.

“What do you mean ‘hence’?”

It looked like Mikihiko was unable to ignore this “nickname”.

“Why do you ask? Miki is short for Mikihiko.”

“I’ve said this countless times! Don’t call me such a feminine name!”

Unfortunately, Erika seemed inured to such scolding given the way it bounced off her.

“Eh? So you prefer Hiko-kun?”

Erika’s face adopted a “Why didn’t you say so earlier?” look as she rounded on Mikihiko.

“Why is this happening! Don’t unilaterally decide to shorten other people’s names!”

“So you want me to call you Mikihiko? Eh~…… Mikihiko Mikihiko Mikihiko Mikihiko…… That’s too big a mouthful, I don’t want to call you that.”

Mikihiko wasn’t the only one who thought this was ridiculous.

“Don’t you feel embarrassed by it?”

“What do you mean embarrassed?”

Erika suddenly bent at the waist.

“Mikihiko……”

Erika brought her face directly in front of the sitting Mikihiko and softly murmured his name with a melodious voice.

His fury forcibly overwritten by other emotions, Mikihiko was struck speechless.

“……Who is that?”

It wasn’t just the person in question, but even Leo was wavering. Quite the impressive destructive power.

“Well? Isn’t it embarrassing?”

Erika’s hair seemed to grow at an accelerated rate; she had entered school with her hair cropped short, but after three short months it had already grown to shoulder length. She tucked her hair behind one ear and revealed a delighted smile.

No matter how obstinate Mikihiko was, even he wasn’t able to quell his wavering heart.

“In…… In that case……”

“Ah, stuttering……”

Mizuki softly whispered. Her personality was probably the more merciless one.

Fortunately, Mikihiko didn’t have the excess mental capacity to hear Mizuki’s words.

“Just call me by my family name!”

“Eh? I thought Miki hated other people calling him by that?”

That comment had been made too rashly.

Mikihiko’s face tightened.

His red, panicked face and attitude were the same as before.

In addition, there was a deep sense of shame tucked beneath the anger.

However, Tatsuya felt that Mikihiko currently hid dark emotions that bordered on hatred.

“Erika, isn’t it time for you to go?”

At the risk of being a busybody, Tatsuya interposed on this conversation and directed Erika’s attention onto himself. Tatsuya discreetly pointed behind him where the coach (the physical education teacher) was glaring over at them.

“Shit! Tatsuya-kun, see you around!”

“Eh? Erika, wait for me!”

Erika hurriedly took off, with Mizuki quickly following.

Tatsuya waved at their retreating backs with a wry smile on his face.

After an awkward period of silence……

“Sorry for dragging you in.”

Mikihiko spoke in a soft tone with his head bowed. He appeared to have deep rooted issues with his family and while he consciously knew that they existed, there were still momentary lapses in his self control.

“Maybe my interference wasn’t needed.”

Tatsuya’s words weren’t merely for comfort, but were spoken from the heart. From what had just transpired, this obviously wasn’t the first time this had occurred, and Erika’s actions may have been to intentionally provoke Mikihiko. Allowing buried frustration and inner emotions to vent may be the best possible way to prevent emotional scars.

“No, that’s hardly the case, especially since we’re still in class.”

However, the reason Mikihiko spoke of was exactly the reason why Tatsuya interfered. Any course of action had a proper time and place, especially since Tatsuya didn’t want to become mired in Mikihiko’s…… Or maybe Erika and Mikihiko’s ongoing issue.

“That being said, Tatsuya is certainly a calm one.”

Mikihiko abruptly changed the topic, possibly because he shrewdly detected Tatsuya’s “not interested in getting entangled” mood.

“What brought this up?”

Given the conversation up until this point, Tatsuya understood that Mikihiko might portray a certain attitude in class, but he was actually very sensitive to others’ moods and emotions. It was just that this change was too abrupt, to the point that any sense of logic was lost.

“What do you mean what……?”

Mikihiko hadn’t properly formulated his thoughts before speaking up, so he wasn’t able to properly convey his meaning.

“Well…… I mean, you saw what Erika was wearing, yet you didn’t bat an eyelid.”

Even so, his example was still too vague, or quite a stretch.

“……I was somewhat surprised at her dress, but surely it wasn’t exposed enough to qualify for that much of a reaction? I thought that it was certainly more conservative than a swimsuit or rhythm gear.”

Tatsuya’s real thoughts were more along the lines of “what the hell is this guy talking about?”, but considering today was the first time they were formally introduced to Mikihiko, and due to the confrontational nature of those words, Tatsuya elected to respond in a more neutral fashion. Anyone who overheard this conversation would certainly have thought that Tatsuya was going on a tangent.

“You don’t care because it was less provocative than swimsuits or rhythm gear? Somehow that just strikes me in the wrong way.”

From a youthful perspective, Leo’s critique was right on the mark. Though Mikihiko raised the question in the first place, even Leo was offering his own abrasive opinion.

“……Tatsuya, you’ve wilted too much. You no longer possess the hallmark of youth.”

Possibly because they both suffered Erika’s teasing, the two of them mutually selected Tatsuya to be their next target.

“Tatsuya isn’t wilted. The bar is set too high with him. With such a beautiful little sister, the majority of normal girls wouldn’t be able to attract his attention.”

“Hm…… You’re probably right, given that this is Miyuki-san we’re talking about? When I saw her for the first time during the enrollment ceremony, I wasn’t just staring dumbly, I was honestly shocked. I can’t believe someone so beautiful actually exists in the world.”

“Ho? Tatsuya, he’s got an eye on your cute little sister. As her brother, what do you have to say?”

Leo wore a mischievous smile as he interrogated Tatsuya, but the person who answered wasn’t the currently beset Tatsuya, but Mikihiko, who had just been betrayed by his comrade.

“Don’t be like that. You’re reading too much into it. I was just talking about it and I have no plans to take the next step, since just thinking about it makes me shake in my boots. If I were looking for a girlfriend, I’d hope I could find a more relaxing and easy-going partner.”

Mikihiko’s words led to Leo nodding deeply in agreement — so deeply that his actions looked intentionally exaggerated.

“You’re right. Not only that, a hardcore bro-con is hard enough, but to get past the invincible sis-con older brother…… The bar is just too high.”

“Leo…… It looks like we need to have another in-depth conversation.”

“Uh, no. That would be too terrifying. I don’t want to put my life on the line for something like this.”

Tatsuya’s heavy gaze caused Leo to quiver in an overblown fashion.

Anyone could tell that Leo was acting, but a portion of the shaking seemed to be genuine, a point that aroused great interest from Mikihiko as he gazed at the two of them.

Leo was taller than Tatsuya by a margin.

His limbs were also thicker and stronger.

From his performance during their team competition, their agility should be roughly equal.

Tatsuya was rumored to have studied under a famous ninjutsu sensei, but was he really that capable in a fight?

Enough to overcome his deficit in Magic Power?

Mikihiko wasn’t aware why he drew Tatsuya’s interest, but he knew from the get go why he was interested in Tatsuya.

Mikihiko was interested in the reason behind Tatsuya’s prowess. He was a newly enrolled Course 2 student that could go toe to toe against Course 1 students and triumph. Mikihiko wanted to know how Tatsuya obtained such power.

For Mikihiko, he earnestly wanted to find a way for him to bridge the gap in Magic Power.

A replacement for the “power” he lost a year ago.

Up until one year ago, Mikihiko was held to be a prodigy, the star of tomorrow that the Yoshida family rested their hopes and dreams on.

Within the various magics of the Yoshida family that had been passed down, one of the core techniques lay in “Summoning Magic”, a skill that Mikihiko possessed enough talent in to eclipse even his older brother who had inherited the family mantle.

From early adolescence until that accident, Mikihiko had always seen himself as one of the strong, and was thus unable to accept his fall from grace.

He knew he was being overly anxious, and he also realized he was withdrawing himself. That feeling of being powerless was sapping away his energy, forcing himself deeper and deeper into the corner.

This past year, he had been relentlessly pursuing knowledge of the arcane.

He had also been practicing martial arts that he had hitherto been lukewarm towards.

Even so, he was still unable to fill that sense of loss.

So once he learned that Tatsuya was also a student with inferior technical skills and imperfect magic ability, yet was still able to overcome upperclassmen that boasted greater Magic Power, there was no way Mikihiko could not be drawn towards Tatsuya.

A close combat technique capable of overcoming a deficiency in Magic Power?

Mikihiko wanted to let Tatsuya and Leo compete against one another so he could see with his own eyes.

Subconsciously, he also wanted to challenge Tatsuya at one point.

“Mikihiko?”

“Ah?”

That was probably the reason.

Hearing his name suddenly called, Mikihiko fell into a combat crouch.

Seeing his reaction, both Tatsuya and Leo forced a smile.

“Please, is there a need for such a murderous reaction?”

“What is it? I was going to say you’ve suddenly gone quiet, then you fall into that stance?”

“Ah, no…… I’m sorry, it was nothing.”

Mikihiko could only apologize shamefacedly. He originally wasn’t adept at social interaction.

The rare friendly atmosphere turned tense and, even though Tatsuya and Leo both tried to lighten the mood, the original cheer never returned even when class ended.




For high schools attached to magic universities, the Nine Schools Competition held in summer and the Thesis Competition held in fall were major events. The extravagance of the Nine Schools Competition largely overshadowed the Thesis Competition, making it the single greatest event on the calendar.

The Nine Schools Competition was an intramural contest based on athletic magic competitions. (Besides magic competitions, there were riddle events, table top games, timed maze challenges, and even treasure hunts.) First High also had clubs for every occasion, but since competition was fiercest around the Nine Schools Competition itself, participants were not only selected from clubs, but anyone deemed capable of winning was selected as a participant.

Thanks to this, preparations for the Nine Schools Competition passed from the Clubs Management Group to the Student Council.

“Even so, it’s not like we can ignore the official participants from the clubs. Just deciding who goes on the final roster is going to be a major headache……”

Even Mayumi, who usually mesmerized everyone with her radiant smile, seemed to wilt a little today.

The fingers that held the chopsticks in her bento seemed boneless as well.

Recently, Miyuki was also very busy, but the President not only had to handle executive tasks, but other tiresome tasks that were not present given her usually sunny mood.

“Thankfully due to Juumonji’s powerful assistance in this matter, we finally have a roster nailed down.”

Today’s lunch and show was Mayumi endlessly complaining about this and that, but it looked like the curtains were finally coming down.

Tatsuya’s stomach wasn’t weak enough to be upset by such trivialities, but always eating lunch with this as the background music would have an adverse effect on the nerves, so Tatsuya heaved a small sigh of relief when Mayumi stopped grouching.

“However, the engineer problem far outweighs the participant problem……”

……Or not.

“We still don’t have the right headcount?”

Mayumi powerlessly nodded at Mari’s inquiry.

“The majority of our students aim to be Magicians, so talented personnel generally gravitate towards technical skills…… Our 3rd Year students are particularly worrisome, with our numbers in the Magic Artificer department reaching dangerous lows. In 2nd Year we have capable people in A-chan and Isori-kun, but our numbers are still insufficient……”

“Isori, eh…… That guy specializes in geometry, so he’s stronger in theory rather than maintenance, right?”

“We’re long past the point of caring about these things.”

It was extremely rare to see both Mayumi and Mari sigh, which said a lot about how serious things were — although using this to evaluate how serious the situation was would be slightly wrong.

“Even if Juumonji and I help out, there’s a limit to how much we can do……”

“Aren’t the two of you our primary participants as well? If you’re too busy worrying about other people’s CADs and allow that to affect your own events, that’s not something we can joke around with.”

“……If Mari could maintain her own CAD, that would lessen the burden a lot.”

“……Yeah, we’re in trouble.”

Maybe due to exhaustion or some other reason, Mari avoided Mayumi’s earnest gaze and looked elsewhere.

The atmosphere in the Student Council Room was borderline hazardous to psychological well being.

In order to return to the classroom — that is, to evacuate the premises — Tatsuya signaled Miyuki with a look, then sought a proper opening.

“Rin-chan, can you help as an engineer?”

Even with the chaos surrounding the preparations for the Nine School Competition, Suzune still hung around in the Student Council Room during lunch and was someone Mayumi never failed to invite.

“That’s impossible. My skills would only hamper Nakajou and the others.”

But was coldly rebuffed each time.

With the apologies to the currently depressed Mayumi, but this was the perfect opportunity to beat a retreat.

Tatsuya glanced meaningfully at Miyuki, then rose—

“Then…… How about we ask Shiba-kun?”

—Just as Tatsuya rose, his escape plan was ruthlessly derailed by Azusa’s unexpected attack.

“Hoh?”

Mayumi, who originally had her head slumped on the table, abruptly lifted her head and let out an unintelligible sound.

Azusa, who up until this moment had been venting her irritation at the large flatscreen terminal in front of her — probably deep in the middle of homework — softly sighed as she hit the power button on her terminal and raised her head.

“I heard that Miyuki-chan’s CAD is maintained by Shiba-kun. I’ve seen it before, and its specs rival those of a first-class corporate technician.”

Mayumi jumped out of her chair.

Her face was suffused with vitality, as if that earlier dejected scene never happened.

“Blind spot……!”

The gaze Mayumi directed towards Tatsuya was like a hawk eyeing its new found prey.

That alone was sufficient for Tatsuya to give up halfway.

“You’re right…… I can’t believe I didn’t think of that, how careless.”

Now that Mari had joined the fray, he was up a creek without a paddle.

“Speaking of which, he also handled the reserve CADs the Committee owns…… But since he’s the only one using them, I never thought about it.”

Resistance was futile. Tatsuya was about 90% ready to give up at this point, but surrendering without a fight was against his principles, so Tatsuya attempted some tiny — and most likely fruitless — resistance.

“Earlier I heard the Chief talk about the importance of CAD technicians, but there’s no precedent for a 1st Year technician, is there?”

“Everything has to start somewhere.”

“Traditions are made to be overturned.”

Mayumi and Mari immediately returned fire at a furious rate.

“The two of you may be ‘progressive thinkers’, but won’t the other participants balk at this? I’m a 1st Year Course 2 student, this would leave a negative impression on many people.”

This was a little self-depreciating coming from him, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t true.

“For CAD maintenance, mutual trust between Magician and Artificer is extremely important. A CAD’s maximum performance is dictated by the level of the user’s mental state. Using a person like me to maintain CADs would lead to severe participant backlash, so I don’t think I’m a good candidate……”

Tatsuya’s logic also had its own merits, causing Mayumi and Mari to exchange a glance.

However, regardless of what Tatsuya said, the two of them had already seen through his facade.

In order to deliver the final blow to the lazy underclassman that didn’t want to take the hot potato and force him to join, the two of them were visually confirming the order of attack (verbal persuasion).

At this time, they received some unexpected reinforcements.

“I was hoping that Onii-sama could work with my CAD while I’m participating in the Nine Schools Competition…… Is that okay?”

Tatsuya froze at Miyuki’s completely unexpected betrayal.

In a Shakespearean drama, Tatsuya’s mood would undoubtedly mirror that of Caesar as he was assassinated — “Et tu, Miyuki (Brutus)”……!

“Exactly! Having a trustworthy and competent technician nearby is absolutely integral for participants to rely on. Well said, Miyuki-chan!”

Mayumi immediately followed up on the attack.

“Yes, if Onii-sama joined the Technician Team, not only I, but Mitsui-san and Kitayama-san could set our minds at ease.”

This was the first time that Tatsuya learned those two were entering the Newcomers Division as participants, but he considered them to be the expected candidates.

—This was also him trying to escape from reality.

Obviously, the battle had been decided.



The preparation meeting held after school in the Club Management Center would decide whether Tatsuya officially joined the roster.

There might be a tiny ray of hope, but Tatsuya had long since given up.

The moment Miyuki assented, Tatsuya had nowhere to run. Under the assumption that his confirmation was in serious jeopardy, he actually had to work hard towards ensuring he was nominated and accepted — these were all within his calculations.

No matter what, the situation was utterly depressing.

At times like these, people tended to retreat into areas they excelled in.

Even if he had an outside chance to be nominated, he still took the time to reflect on what he could do, what areas he excelled at, and re-examined his own sense of worth to properly restore his internal balance as a means of self compensation.

This was possibly due to the build up of considerable stress, as it was rare for Tatsuya to fall into this sort of self compensatory trap.

Two-thirds of the lunch period had already passed. Miyuki was engrossed in dealing with the piles of documents and homework, while Tatsuya, who was currently idle while waiting for Miyuki, removed the silver CAD from the shoulder holster and started examining the modules in the cartridge, the buttons for switching Activation Sequences, and other movable parts.

“Ah, you brought the Silver Horn today as well.”

Until now, Azusa was completely focused on her homework, but her sharp eyes caught Tatsuya’s movement as she inched forward.

Tatsuya slowly shifted his gaze, not towards Mayumi or Mari, but Suzune.

Suzune accurately interpreted Tatsuya’s silent inquiry as she adeptly used her brows and the shrugging of her shoulders to express a helpless emotion. In other words, the current Azusa had completely lost interest in her homework.

“Yes, I purchased a new holster, so I would like to get used to it as soon as possible.”

Was this what they meant by “being furious after receiving three in the morning, then happy when receiving four in the evening”? Tatsuya was mentally considering this somewhat objective but also very rude train of thought as he shifted his gaze back onto Azusa and responded in a gentle manner. (To supplement, Tatsuya was thinking of what it meant to play fast and loose.)

Azusa’s eyes shone brilliantly as she approached him. It seemed that she was not only interested in the CAD itself, but the supplementary equipment as well.

“Eh, is it okay if I take a look?”

Truthfully speaking, Azusa generally avoided — more like was terrified of — Tatsuya. Precisely because of this impression, Tatsuya wanted to smile wryly. However, given the way Azusa was bouncing around like a small animal and unable to calm down, he probably shouldn’t treat her too poorly.

This may be a form of popularity — Tatsuya thought as he removed the jacket he wore even in the heat of summer — with built-in cooling systems, of course — and took off the shoulder holster before handing it to Azusa.

“Wow~ It’s an original model for the Silver series.

Such an amazing trim would draw incredible lines when drawing and firing.

Something that didn’t just cater to high technical skills but also a design that also took the user’s skill into account.

Ah, I worship your genius, Silver-sama……”

After she received the holster, Azusa was happy enough to almost rub her face against it.

Tatsuya was barely able to maintain his poker face.

After Azusa meticulously went over every centimeter of the holster — or maybe finally satisfied herself— she returned it to Tatsuya with a pleased smile on her face.

“Shiba-kun is also a fan of the Silver series? If based only on price and specs, the Maximilian Speed Shooter, Russ Type-F, or even Sagittarius series developed by FLT (Four Leaves Technology) are better deals, but the individual customization of the Silver series is so good that no one cares about the price!”

Tatsuya recalled that Mari once described Azusa as a “Device-otaku”.

At the time, he was considerate enough to consider this an exaggeration, but after witnessing her behavior today, he reflected that such a nickname was probably inevitable.

From Tatsuya’s perspective, if the contrast between price and performance — efficiency, in other words — was too low, then satisfaction would also drop. Even if that were the case, true performance may differ from official documentation. Simply put, qualitative performance that could not be converted into numerical format was also very important. If one could be “satisfied” without making this sort of analysis, Tatsuya considered that to be nothing more than brand loyalty.

That being said, that was a matter of personal values, so if she said she was satisfied, he had no reason to rain on her parade.

“No, I actually have a few connections, so I can buy Silver Series at a discount thanks to my work as a beta tester.”

The moment Tatsuya said this, Miyuki’s shoulders visibly shook a little as she faced the other way towards the terminal, but no one noticed.

“Eh~! Really?”

The word “envy” was stamped all over Azusa’s face.

This time, even Tatsuya’s expression revealed a little spasm.

“……Next time I test the new model, would you like me to get you one as well?”

“Eh?

Really?

Like, really, really?

Thanks!”

There was no way for him to fit in a response.

After Tatsuya was finally able to nod in assent, Azusa grabbed his empty left hand with both of her own and shook it up and down.

“……A-chan, relax a little bit.”

Mayumi couldn’t watch any longer, temporarily stopping her work on the pile of documents to speak to Azusa.

Azusa suddenly stopped.

Filled with trepidation, she looked at her hands.

Her hands were tightly wound around Tatsuya’s hand. Azusa felt this not only with her sense of touch, but confirmed it visually as well.

She slowly raised her head towards Tatsuya, then quickly dodged Tatsuya’s expressionless gaze and looked back at her hands.

Azusa let go and jumped back as if her hands had grasped fire.

“Sorry, sorry, sorry……!”

“Flushed face” wasn’t sufficient to describe Azusa’s current state, since her face was red to the root of her ears. She repeatedly bowed towards Tatsuya in apology.

Tatsuya was starting to get really worried that Azusa would keep bowing until she was dizzy, and glanced towards Mayumi for help.

“……A-chan, you can stop now. Tatsuya-kun is a little overwhelmed right now.”

Mayumi was probably thinking along the same lines as Tatsuya, so she didn’t add to the mayhem (not without cause) and focused on comforting Azusa.

Azusa took a deep breath as she was instructed and finally managed to settle down.

Mayumi let out a helpless sigh before turning back to her work.

Azusa turned an embarrassed smile towards Tatsuya and quickly turned solemn.

“Then, Shiba-kun wouldn’t happen to know Taurus Silver in person?”

She asked in this manner.

—It went without saying that she was doing so to cover her embarrassment.

Unfortunately, this question was a very difficult one to answer for Tatsuya.

“……No, I’m not entirely certain.”

Electric clamors rang out from near the wall.

The workstation that Miyuki was using activated the alarm by accident.

Everyone hit a typo every once in a while, but it was extremely rare for Miyuki to erroneously activate the alarm.

Both Mayumi and Suzune wore an “Eh?” expression while looking at Miyuki who was facing the wall, but Miyuki soldiered onward as if nothing had happened, so the two of them didn’t ask any further and returned to their respective piles.

“……Miyuki-chan actually made a mistake, how strange.”

“Occasionally, yes.”

In comparison, Tatsuya’s response was overly level, but Azusa didn’t notice as she returned to the original — the recent —— conversation.

“No matter how much he hides himself, the people in the same lab should know something, right? Unless, he invented everything by himself?”

“……No, I’m certain that would be impossible.”

“I think so too. Oh yeah, Shiba-kun, can’t you use your ‘connections’ at the lab to get some more information?”

“……No, the connections I spoke of aren’t in that category…… Also, FLT keeps most of their corporate secrets under wrap, so I think it’s highly unlikely to get anything out of the lab technicians.”

“Oh~ that’s true……”

“……I’m sure senpai already knows, but using Informational Manipulative Outersystematic-type magic to uncover secrets is a felony.”

“Ah? Nah…… No way, why would I think…… about that kind of thing……”

Tatsuya looked at Azusa with his eyes half closed, causing Azusa’s already petite body to shrink even further.

“……It’s okay, as long as senpai is clear on that point. I just wanted to remind you.”

“Don’t…… don’t worry about it, of course I know about something like that, Ah, ha ha ha……”

Seeing that Azusa wasn’t making a metaphor and was actually breaking out into a cold sweat, Tatsuya took his foot off the gas.

“Speaking of which, why is Nakajou-senpai so interested in Taurus Silver’s real identity?”

The CAD Azusa used wasn’t FLT’s brand either. Even though she obviously wasn’t a Silver Series user, why did she care so much about the identity of the developer?

For Tatsuya, this was a perfectly natural question.

“Ah?”

From Azusa’s expression, she was completely dumbfounded that Tatsuya even asked this question.

“Of course I care, Tatsuya-kun, I mean, do you not?

This is Taurus Silver.

The first person in the world to develop the ‘Loop Cast System’, raising the speed of Activation Sequences for Specialized CADs by twenty percent, he also reduced the variability of wireless models from 3 percent to less than 1 percent. Taurus Silver is just that amazing.

Also, rather than guarding his secrets for personal profit, he openly publicizes his findings for the betterment of the magical community as a whole, which makes Taurus Silver even more incredible.

He is called the genius engineer that advanced CAD software technology by ten years within one short year, so I think that no one who aims to be a Magic Artificer would be uninterested in him.”

This overbearing pressure that was almost synonymous to scolding forced Tatsuya to shrink back. He was completely caught off guard by how much the world had built up “Taurus Silver”.

“Excuse my ignorance. As a user, I’m not dissatisfied with the Silver series, I just wasn’t aware that it had such glowing reviews……”

“Ah…… That makes sense, Shiba-kun is a tester, so for you, Silver series isn’t all that rare…… Hence why you have a different outlook than I do.”

Azusa didn’t completely understand, but allowed herself to be convinced.





“Hey, hey, Shiba-kun, let me ask you, what do you think Taurus Silver is like?”

A purely inquisitive gaze.

Wanting to change the subject, Tatsuya replied back trying to stall for time.

“Well…… I wonder how shocking would it be if he turned out to be a Japanese teenager like us.”

Once again, electric clamors rang out from near the wall.

Miyuki continued to sit in a posture with her back completely straight as she toiled away.

—But she didn’t allow anyone to see her current expression.

“Speaking of which, A-chan.”

“Yes, President, what is it?”

In the end, Mayumi finally extended a helping hand towards Tatsuya, who was almost unable to handle Azusa. This might be a little biased, but this was the first time Tatsuya felt like Mayumi was someone dependable. At any rate, Mayumi’s stance was that she wanted Azusa to hurry back to her work on the Student Council.

“Weren’t you supposed to finish your homework before the end of lunch?”

However, even if this was lending a hand to Tatsuya, this was undoubtedly the knell of doom for Azusa…… That description might be a hyperbole, but Azusa’s expression was just so. The very fact that she was engrossed in talking about Taurus Silver was likely a way for her to escape from reality.

“President~”

From the way Azusa tearfully implored Mayumi for help, she was likely doomed.

“Don’t make such an embarrassing sound.”

Mayumi smiled wryly and turned her gaze from the completed inventory invoice towards Azusa.

“I can help a little bit, so what’s your assignment?”

Mari directed a “You’re pampering her too much” gaze towards Mayumi, who promptly ignored it — more like pretended not to see it — as she smiled towards Azusa.

“I’m sorry…… It’s a report on the ‘Three Great Puzzles of Weight Systemic Magic’……”

At this, Suzune, Mari, and Tatsuya immediately turned their gazes on the glum Azusa.

“……W-what?”

Like a deer in the headlights, Azusa shrank into a ball in terror. Her tearful eyes and terrified movements gave the impression that everyone was bullying her, at which Tatsuya turned his eyes away, with Suzune mirroring his thoughts and actions.

Only Mari still stared at Azusa.

“Ho ho……”

Mari watched Azusa with deep interest, though she was more focused on the flat screen terminal in Azusa’s hands.

“I was wondering what was puzzling the annual top 5 honor student Nakajou and it turned out to be this.”

“Isn’t this the topic they ask every year?”

After Mari spoke, Mayumi continued with an uncomprehending expression.

“A-chan, what’s this year’s prompt?”

Because the prompts were routine, there were already enough prompts that the school was incapable of creating new ideas. This wasn’t just homework, it was also one of the primary essay topics for magic university entrance exams. A cursory search would reveal a bountiful harvest of model answers to this prompt.

“The subject of the homework involves how to solve the bottlenecks of the ‘Three Great Puzzles’. The first two I get, but I am unable to explain the reason why Generalized Flying-Type Magic hasn’t been successfully developed……”

Hearing this, Suzune nodded with an “I understand” expression on her face.

“In other words, Azusa-kun is unable to accept the currently proposed concepts.”

“Exactly!”

With Suzune able to express her inner thoughts for her, Azusa nodded vigorously.

“The foundation for magic that can defy gravity and allow the physical body to float into the air has already been laid down by the Four Great Systemic and the Eight Major Types of Modern Magic and has already entered the practical phase.”

“Yes, though injury caused by free fall remains one of the major dangers for Magicians.”

Azusa shifted her gaze to Mayumi, who supported her argument.

“Magicians adept in Speed and Weight Magics are already capable of leaping dozens of yards at a time, and the world record is held by a Magician who leapt over 100 yards in one try. The record for landing is even greater, with some Magicians able to drop 2000 meters successfully without any equipment.”

“If that’s the case, why is Flying-Type Magic…… Free movement in the sky still elusive…… Right?”

“To be precise, Generalized Flying-Type Magic that anyone can use remains elusive. There are a handful of Ancient Magic users that can freely fly through the sky.”

Suzune added a few details to Mayumi’s explanation.

Hearing this, Azusa shook her head, though this was probably an involuntary action.

“That type of magic approaches the unique abilities of BS Magicians. Since it can’t be shared, it can’t really be called a technique.

Theoretically, you can use Speed and Weight Systemic Magic to nullify the effect of gravity and soar into the sky. In reality, long jump and floating magic have already been developed, so why can’t we fly……?”

“Wouldn’t higher level reference tomes contain the answer to this question?”

Mayumi visually interrogated Azusa as to why she couldn’t accept the answer chronicled in the books.

“Magic Sequences must include an end point, as the effect of overwriting reality is sustained until the ending conditions are met. While a target object is under the effect of magic, if you want to cause a different type of magic to manifest on the target, you need to use magic that has superior phenomena interference ability.

When using Flying-Type Magic, every time you adjust speed or height, you aren’t just overwriting the original magic with a new one, you also need a stronger phenomena interference ability. A single Magician is only able to separate the phenomena rewriting ability into ten segments, so he or she can only adjust the flying status ten times before hitting their limit.

……This is the publicly acknowledged hurdle to why there’s no practical solution to Flying-Type Magic, right?”

Mayumi didn’t ruminate very long before nodding her assent to Azusa’s long-winded explanation.

“What, A-chan, you’ve done your research. You’ve organized all your arguments, so what’s the problem?”

“According to this line of thinking, the problem lies in the fact that new magic needs to constantly overwrite the currently active magic, correct? If that’s the case, I think that it would be easier to cancel the current magic than activate the new magic.”

By now, Azusa had completely shaken off the earlier tearful expression, and was now plunging ahead at a feverish pace. Suzune calmly asked Azusa the next question:

“The theory is sound, but from a practical standpoint how would you cancel the active magic?”

“Why don’t you insert a condition for ending the magic during the design of the Magic Sequence? In other words, by preemptively entering a small Magic Sequence into the active Magic Sequence, this can be turned into the ending condition for the magic.”

Azusa was immersed in her theory while, conversely, Suzune was calmly stating her counter argument.

“Unfortunately, Magic Sequences are unable to affect other Magic Sequences. Magic Sequences can only be used to affect the Information Body, even if two types of magic are both trying to influence the same Information Body, only the one with the stronger interference strength would actually manifest, as Magic Sequences don’t possess a strong versus weak relationship.

Counter magic that can dissolve Magic Sequences do exist, but that’s high level magic that directly influences the Information Body. This would be okay at the experimental level, but currently there are no Magicians who can freely wield practical levels of Counter Magic.”

“Is that so……?”

By the time students reached the second semester of their second year, Foundations of Magic class would progress to Applications of Magic. This class started with concepts surrounding “Counter Magic” — magic that nullifies opposing magic — which was what Suzune was explaining right now. Normally, this was something that was taught during the first semester of 3rd Year, which was why Azusa wasn’t familiar with the subject. That being said, to hear the term “Counter Magic” and not be hopelessly lost, Azusa’s knowledge was broad indeed.

“However, this is still a worthwhile theory.”

Azusa’s emotions bounced between zealous and gloomy. Suzune smiled at her in a gentle and comforting manner.

“To cancel magic the moment its effects manifest, I believe this is the correct approach.”

“That’s true. Because of the need to rewrite the activated magic, the necessary interference strength becomes a vicious cycle.”

Following Suzune, Mayumi also supported Azusa’s theory.

“No one has proposed this until this point, but if a new magic can be activated the moment the currently active magic is stopped from affecting the phenomenon, then there shouldn’t be a need for stronger interference strength…… Given that the target is flying in the air, the delay between magics must be reduced to zero, so if a Specialized CAD were used, then in theory the next magic should be activated before the target starts dropping……”

Mayumi seemed to be muttering to herself, then abruptly made an “Eh?” sound as she turned her head.

“But if it’s just removing the effects of magic, shouldn’t someone have attempted this long ago? In the end, this is like working with ‘Zone Interference’ after the fact.”

At Mayumi’s question, Suzune pulled up the search function on the public workstation located in the Student Council Room.

“Give me a second…… Last year, England attempted a massive experiment based on the same conceptual design the President spoke of. They wanted to use ‘Post-Event Zone Interference’ to create a practical Flying-Type Magic.”

Suzune swiftly located the news articles on magic that contained the information she wanted.

“Then, the result was?”

The inquiring voice was a little high pitched, likely caused by the excitement bubbling out of her, which proved that Mayumi was still a high school student beyond all doubt.

“Complete failure. According to the report, in comparison to the normal situation where magic is repeatedly used, this method only served to increase the demand for interference strength at a geometric rate.”

“……Is that so……?”

At Suzune’s report that so betrayed her hopes, Mayumi drooped in disappointment.

“Did they cite a reason?”

“No, the article wasn’t that detailed. President, why do you think it happened?”

When asked by Suzune, Mayumi pointed her index finger at her chin and let out a “Hm!” sound as she considered this.

“The previous magic should’ve stopped functioning by then…… Tatsuya-kun, what do you think?”

The reason Mayumi had asked Tatsuya was to buy time for her to organize her thoughts.

She didn’t actually expect him to answer.

“The English experiment provided by Ichihara-senpai has a basic conceptual error.”

Thus, Tatsuya’s decisive answer completely caught Mayumi offguard.

“……Where is the error?”

Astounded, Mayumi was barely able to ask her question. Neither boastful nor proud, Tatsuya calmly began his explanation.

“Magic Sequences that have not fulfilled their ending requirements will naturally fade with time, but will remain with the target Information Body. When a new magic nullifies the previous magic’s effects, the previous magic looks to be canceled, but in reality is merely being overwritten.”

Mayumi, Suzune, Azusa, and even Mari were now staring at Tatsuya outright, but Tatsuya remained unmoved by the pressure of their gaze. He remained expressionless and his tone did not change in the slightest.

“Let’s assume the previous magic is called Magic Sequence A, while Magic Sequence B is used to nullify the other one.

With the activation of Magic Sequence B, Magic Sequence A loses its phenomenon effect ability. However, even if Magic Sequence A loses its effect, it still remains with the target’s Information Body.

Both Magic Sequences A and B are still acting on the target’s Information Body, it’s just that only the effects of Magic Sequence B are visible. Just as Ichihara-senpai said, Magic Sequences can only affect the Information Body and are unable to affect one another. This is true even in Zone Interference. Unless the original Magic Sequence is itself nullified, using Counter Magic would yield the same result.”

“……So the English experiment used unnecessary magic that was not part of Flying-Type Magic?”

Tatsuya nodded his assent to Mayumi’s question, then continued his explanation.

“In other words, every time you make adjustments in flight, you would rewrite the Magic Sequence again. In order to maintain flight, the extra rewrites would pile on, so of course you would rapidly hit the upper limit for phenomenon interference ability. The English scholar who designed this experiment must have been mistaken on the nature of Counter Magic.”

The portable terminal that Tatsuya wore in his breast pocket chose this moment to start vibrating, signaling the first warning bell for the end of the lunch period.

“Miyuki, let’s return to class.”

“Yes, Onii-sama.”

Miyuki, whose back was to them the entire time, rose immediately upon being called.

Her voice, expression and movements were just as gentle and graceful as usual.

Hence Mayumi, Suzune, Mari, and Azusa hadn’t noticed.

Couldn’t have noticed.

When Miyuki had been seated before the workstation, her back was ramrod straight with pride, and her fingers fairly danced across the keyboard in pleasure.




The preparation meeting for the Nine Schools Competition held in the Club Management Headquarters was suffused with a nervous aura from the onset.

Students with outstanding performance in the events would receive extra credit for their classes. Just for being one of the official participants, students would receive no homework, extra days off and guaranteed straight A’s.

Not only did this apply to participants, but to the students selected as engineers as well.

Thanks to the school putting such a high emphasis on the Nine Schools Competition, the students selected as the representatives for the Nine Schools Competition received such incredible rewards. Thus, it was unsurprising that the competition was particularly fierce for the last few slots on the official roster during this meeting.



—If Tatsuya had been merely a bystander, he would probably have viewed the mixed feelings of the surrounding students in a compassionate light. However, he was there as a candidate with a giant target on his back, so he could only depressingly keep himself from sighing aloud while praying for this circus to end quickly.

It was not that he was wholly uninterested in the Nine Schools Competition.

The desire to measure one’s personal skills against other Magicians (saplings) of similar age was markedly different from the hunger he experienced while staying in his father’s lab and the subsequent desire to bring about practical upgrades to CADs, but Tatsuya still had that much left in him.

Tatsuya was “constructed” to have less emotion than the average person, but he was still at that headstrong age, so no matter what value his peers assigned him, he wasn’t shriveled enough to completely not care.

However, at the same time he had to deal with the pride, jealousy, vanity, disgust, and other related emotions in this meeting. That was what truly filled him with melancholy.

Separate from his thoughts — of course — the seats in the conference room were gradually filled. When the last seat was occupied, Mayumi stood before the chairman’s podium.

“Then, let’s start the selection meeting for the Nine Schools Competition roster.”

The meeting for upperclassmen, club leaders for the various participating clubs, Student Council members (Miyuki remained on station in the Student Council Room) and the Club Management Group members who received the internal notification that they were possible candidates for participant or engineer slots officially began.

Tatsuya sat with the various candidates in the visitors section to the side,

Any organization that exceeded a certain size would naturally contain bigots that swiftly identified Tatsuya as an outsider.

As expected, not long after the meeting began, someone asked what a 1st Year Course 2 student was doing here.

That certainly did not imply that no one looked upon Tatsuya kindly.

There were actually a surprising number of favorable opinions.

The upperclassmen differed from the 1st Year students in that they knew Tatsuya was a special Course 2 student in addition to being a formidable asset to the Public Morals Committee.

Despite this, there were still more opposing than supporting, often in the form of negative emotions rather than objective logic, which caused the meeting to deadlock and waste more valuable time.

“In summation……”

Suddenly, a solemn voice dominated the conference room.

The voice was not particularly loud, yet all the squabbles quickly died away as everyone focused on the speaker.

Juumonji Katsuto, who had hitherto remained silent, cast his gaze across the room before starting to speak:

“In my opinion, the problem lies in that everyone is unfamiliar with what level of skill Shiba possesses. If so, the most efficient solution is to submit that to a live test.”

The spacious room was dead silent.

This would bring about a simple and effective result that no one would bemoan, but because of the risk involved, no one had dared to propose this course of action.

“……That’s not a bad suggestion, but how do we go about it in a practical manner?”

“Simply having him perform a maintenance right now would suffice.”

Mari broke the silence with her question, to which Katsuto provided a simple answer.

“Allow me to be the guinea pig.”

The CADs currently on the market had to be intricately synchronized with their respective user after maintenance.

If ten Magicians used the same model, there were ten different methods to adjust their CADs.

The Activation Sequences provided by the CAD would be directly absorbed into the Magician’s subconscious domain.

In other words, a Magician’s mental state was completely defenseless against their own CAD.

Recent CAD models were equipped with a function that improved Activation Sequence processing, but at the same time made it easier for them to affect the user’s mental status.

If there was a problem during maintenance, not only would magic efficiency decrease, other side effects would include discomfort, headaches, dizziness, vomiting, or even major harm such as hallucinations or mental scarring. Thus, the higher the CAD’s capability, the more skilled the maintenance needed to be.

For Magicians, voluntarily yielding their CAD to be maintained by an Artificer whose strength was unknown posed a substantial risk.

Even if it was Katsuto’s own suggestion, his willingness to offer himself as a test subject showed considerable courage.

“No, I was the one who recommended him, so I should take that role.”

Mayumi immediately requested to take responsibility likely out of a sense of duty, but from another perspective, this likely implied that she didn’t wholly trust Tatsuya, which was something that Tatsuya easily read between the lines to his discomfort.

“Wait, please let me do it.”

That being said, the fact that Kirihara was willing to pinch hit caused Tatsuya considerable shock — the mettle displayed by this man was certainly comforting.

The school’s CAD maintenance facility open to faculty and students was located in the Technical Skills Building.

However, this time they weren’t using the preset maintenance devices in the Practical Skills Building, but bringing the mobile maintenance devices used in the Nine Schools Competition to the conference room to conduct their test.

The CAD in question was also one that qualified under the regulations of the Nine Schools Competition.

Seeing as how the pre-competition preparations proceeded so smoothly both in materials and procedure, the continuously delayed selection process was a particularly glaring issue.

Tatsuya sat before the maintenance device with Kirihara on the other side — but the two of them couldn’t see one another. The members of the Student Council and various clubs leaders crowded around Kirihara.

The first step involved activating the school device, a process during which many malicious gazes were focused on Tatsuya’s hand movements, but Tatsuya was long accustomed to working with much more complex devices than the school device, so this was a procedure he could have completed flawlessly in his sleep. He adeptly completed the preparations and adopted a poker face to ward off the abhorring gazes.

“My task involves copying Kirihara-senpai’s CAD schematics onto the competition-use CAD, making any necessary adjustments without changing the Activation Sequence, am I correct?”

Tatsuya once again verified the test’s contents.

“Yes, sorry for bothering you.”

Tatsuya on seeing Mayumi nodding shook his head slightly. Not nodding, shaking.

“……What is it?”

“I wouldn’t advise directly copying the schematics onto a different model CAD…… But there’s nothing for it, so let’s put safety as the first priority.”

“?”

Mayumi wasn’t the only one dumbfounded. “Copying CAD schematics” was a simple task that occurred when users changed machines, so many other people were also wondering why Tatsuya viewed this as a problem.

However, the Technician Team centered around Azusa knew exactly why Tatsuya asked this question. The team members either nodded slightly in agreement or smirked as they prepared to enjoy Tatsuya’s performance.

Tatsuya didn’t say anything else and plunged into the maintenance.

First, he connected Kirihara’s CAD to the maintenance device.

The schematics replication process was semi-automatic, so there was no way to gauge the difference in skill here.

However, Tatsuya didn’t just dump the schematics replica directly into the calculation device of the competition-use CAD, but stored it into the processing area of the maintenance device, a move that caused quite a few people to raise their eyebrows.

Next he measured Kirihara’s personal psion oscillation nature.

Following Tatsuya’s instructions, Kirihara put the headset on his head, then placed both hands on the examination board.

This was also normal procedure. If this was an automatic maintenance device, the steps required would be to connect the CAD, then read the psion waves, and the process would automatically complete itself.

Generally, students that used the school devices for personal maintenance would adopt that precise procedure.

On the other hand, not relying on automatic maintenance and manually making minute adjustments to the CAD’s OS showed an engineer’s true strength.

“Thank you senpai, you can take it off now.”

Tatsuya indicated that the measurements were concluded and Kirihara removed the headset.

Ordinarily, the next step involved connecting the CAD that needed to be modified, then making any adjustments beyond the automatic recommendations. This required a preset CAD to be prepared in advance, then copying all the data onto the destination CAD.

Just about everyone in the audience thought that Tatsuya messed up the procedure.

As if to prove this point, Tatsuya stared at the monitor without moving a muscle.

However, he didn’t give off the air of someone who was hopelessly lost because of a misstep.

His gaze was focused to a terrifying degree without giving a hint of that unsteady feeling.

Unable to contain her curiosity, Azusa poked her head around Tatsuya’s body to glance at the monitor.

“Uh?”

Her voice let out an awkward sound that was wholly incompatible with her youthful image.

Tatsuya was completely unaffected by this interruption.

Mayumi and Mari didn’t dare to ask what was going on, so they both came to Azusa’s side to look at the monitor — and were barely able to contain their gasps.

The monitor didn’t display the expected measurement results and graphs, but was filled with character strings scrolling across at high velocity.

The two of them were only able to pick out a few numbers here and there; their eyes were wholly unable to keep up with the scrolling pace.

The numbers abruptly came to a stop.

Roughly a few dozen seconds had elapsed, which was less than 5 minutes since Tatsuya started staring at the screen.

After the character strings stopped scrolling, Tatsuya immediately plugged in the competition-use calculation device and swiftly started hitting the keyboard.

Many windows started opening and closing.

Only Azusa noticed that one of the opened windows was the original document with the recorded measurement results, while another window was the original document that contained the replicated CAD schematics on the maintenance device.

Very few people recognized how insanely advanced the procedure unfolding before their eyes truly was, since the majority of the audience was held spellbound at the unheard of speed at which Tatsuya was hitting the keyboard. Even so, Azusa believed that the truly astounding part was the technique Tatsuya displayed when he was directly reading the nature of the psion oscillations from the original document.

With that method, the engineer could perfectly allocate the resources within the parameters of the calculation device to best suit the measurement results reflected in the maintenance device. This was a completely manual process wholly independent of the automatic processes provided by the system.

Before Azusa’s gaze, the settings temporarily stored in the work area were steadily being rewritten in a flash.

The original document still remained on the main screen, but Azusa was barely able to detect the modified settings.

This definitely fell within the boundaries of safety. He was really adhering to the “safety is the first priority” condition.

This way, it would lower the user’s risk from relying on automatic maintenance, and provide Activation Sequences that exceeded automatic maintenance in efficiency.

There was absolutely no need for a practical test.

This 1st Year student’s skill far surpassed that of anyone in the Technician Team.

Azusa made up her mind right there that she was going to drag Tatsuya onto the team no matter what, objections be damned.



Under the condition “without changing the Activation Sequence” the maintenance quickly came to an end.

He was so fast that the audience wasn’t thoroughly entertained.

The next part was the actual live test.

Unnoticed by others, Kirihara’s expression was slightly nervous and tense, but fell within the expected boundaries.

In reality, there was no incident, nor was there anything that could even be remotely called an accident.

The CAD Tatsuya modified was “completely the same” as Kirihara’s beloved CAD.

“Kirihara, how do you feel?”

“No problem at all. It’s just like I’m using my own CAD, there’s no incompatible feeling at all.”

Kirihara immediately answered Katsuto’s question.

Everyone was perfectly clear that this was not an inflated evaluation based on friendship. Given Kirihara and Tatsuya’s past history — Kirihara was forcibly subdued by Tatsuya during the kenjutsu club’s performance during recruitment week in April — people who knew the particulars were aware that there’s no way Kirihara would protect Tatsuya. However, even excluding this “misunderstanding”, everyone who saw the way the magic invocated knew that the CAD was functioning perfectly smoothly.

That being said, “able to smoothly invoke magic” was a fairly low criterion and it was hard to see any further results.

“……Looks like he has the fundamentals down, but this isn’t enough to qualify him to be one of the school representatives.”

“Time spent was pretty average, nothing special.”

“He didn’t follow proper procedure, but there may be some reason behind that……”

Unsurprisingly, the 2nd Year participants were the first to react negatively to this seemingly normal result.

The backlash wasn’t solely from Tatsuya’s unprecedented nomination, but also since he was specifically picked by the President, everyone subconsciously expected him to floor them all with some outstanding technique, so naturally higher expectations led to greater disappointment.

“I fully support bringing Shiba-kun onto the team!”

Abandoning her usual cowed expression, Azusa furiously countered.

“What he just displayed before our eyes was a technique that far surpasses our wildest dreams as high school students. Just the very fact that he doesn’t need to use automatic maintenance and is able to do this entirely manually is already a feat that I cannot accomplish.”

“……Even if his technique was amazing, what’s the point if it’s such a mundane result……?”

“It only looks mundane, but the contents are completely different! To be able to completely abide within the safety parameters at no loss of efficiency is an incredible accomplishment!”

“Nakajou, relax a little bit…… Rather than staying confined within the safety parameters, wouldn’t it be better to take a few chances to raise the efficiency rate?”

“That’s…… because they suddenly want to test……”

Debate wasn’t one of her strong suits, so her vigor quickly diminished.

Just as Azusa was floundering, a male student raised his hand to be recognized, which swiftly brought everyone’s attention onto him.

“Kirihara’s personal model boasts superior performance to the competition-use models, but even with this difference, the user was still unable to detect any difference, so I believe this technique deserves high praise.”

“Eh? ……Hattori-kun?”

Out of the blue, the one who came to the rescue was Hattori.

“President, I also support Shiba joining the Technician Team.”

“Hanzou-kun?”

Mayumi was entirely unable to mask her startled expression.

Even faced with the somewhat negative reaction on part of his beloved President, excluding his personal thoughts, Hattori continued fearlessly (on the outside) and graciously extolled his opinion.

“The Nine Schools Competition is an event that affects the very reputation of our school, so we should send the best and strongest candidates, without placing too much emphasis on who they are. The engineer’s job is to support the participants so that they can focus exclusively on the events themselves. Just as Nakajou said, for Kirihara to say ‘there’s no incompatible feeling’, I must admit that is a job done admirably well. With our current desperate lack of engineers, this isn’t the time to bemoan that ‘he’s a 1st Year student’ or ‘this is unprecedented’.”

Hattori’s words were saturated with verbal barbs, but he strenuously defended his heart-felt position.

However, the very fact that Hattori threw in on Tatsuya’s side was a large enough blow to rock the meeting.

“I also think that Hattori’s opinion bears merit.

The talent Shiba put on display is more than enough to qualify him as one of the school representatives.

I also support Shiba joining the Technician Team.”

With the opposition stunned into silence and Katsuto’s public declaration of support, Tatsuya’s nomination was certain.





Chapter 2




After the siblings shared their customary dinner together, the telephone picked this precise moment to start ringing.

Speaking of which, as everyone knows, almost all modern telephones were equipped with “web cams”, a detail that third rate social commentators never failed to decry, saying that they aren’t tele“phones” but tele“screens” or some related but meaningless subject. Even with this projected function brought into fruition, they are still referred to as “telephones”.

— Back on topic —

Miyuki was currently in the kitchen cleaning up.

She wasn’t adamant on doing the dishes herself since she could pass them to the HAR, but their household wasn’t equipped with the 3H (Humanoid Home Helper, or simply “Housework robot”) that had just hit the market for mass consumption. The two of them unanimously agreed that having a pair of robot arms extending from the ceiling was more of a hassle than anything, so they were better off cleaning up after themselves.

— Miyuki said that if they were too lazy to do even this, their fitness would rapidly decrease.



— Once again, back on topic —

Simply put, this was the reason why Tatsuya picked up the phone, though occasionally — that’s how it was.

“Long time no see…… Did you intend to do that?”

“……Wait a minute, I have no idea what you’re talking about…… Long time no see, Special Lieutenant.”

Onscreen was a familiar face wearing a very surprised expression.

“It’s been two months since we last spoke, but…… If you’re using that title, does that mean this is an encrypted transmission? I can’t believe you can tap into the civilian line every time.”

“It’s not that easy, Special Lieutenant. Compared to the standards of an average household, isn’t the security surrounding your house a little too tight?”

“That’s because there are a lot of hackers active recently, and the household servers have sensitive information stored within them.”

“No wonder. We were almost traced on our end.”

“You deserved that. As long as you don’t delve too deeply into the database, the defense system shouldn’t activate.”

“I think this serves as an excellent warning shot for my newest switchboard.”

Onscreen, the face that had been baptized into coarse leather by long exposure to sunlight and gunpowder revealed a mischievous smile.

As he saw this smile, Tatsuya reflected that the man hadn’t aged a day since three years ago.

Based on his rank and department, he must deal with a myriad of details daily, but he never betrayed any trace of exhaustion…… As these thoughts chased one another around in his mind, Tatsuya suddenly recalled that the one on the other side of the line — The Army’s 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion CO Major Kazama Harunobu didn’t like to waste unnecessary time on small talk.

“Major, what’s on the agenda today?”

“That’s right, let’s cut the small talk. Business first.”

“Please go ahead.”

“Today we completed modifications on the ‘Third Eye’. We upgraded some components to the latest models and updated the software, so I would like you to test it out.”

The 101 was pronounced “One Zero One”, and not “One Hundred and First”.

This was a primarily magic-based experimental detachment that was separate from the normal chain of command. In addition, the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion was also responsible for the development of cutting edge equipment.

Compared to regular military classification, the security clearance for this detachment was five to six levels higher. Accordingly, a regular high school student had no business interacting with such a division, to the point that he or she would be wholly ignorant of its existence.

However, due to certain classified events, Tatsuya was actually an official member of Kazama’s division.

“Understood. I will report in first thing tomorrow.”

“……Wait a second, this isn’t so important that you need to take a day off from school.”

“No, next weekend I plan to visit the lab to test out a new calculation device.”

“Although I’m in no position to say so…… But ever since you entered high school, you’ve been leading a decisively non-student-like lifestyle.”

“I dislike your impression, but there’s nothing I can do about it.”

“That’s true…… No matter how busy we get, there’s nothing we can do about it. In that case, meet up at the old place tomorrow morning. I’m sorry I won’t be there, but I will contact Sanada ahead of time.”

“Understood.”

Tatsuya saluted in acceptance, while Kazama repeated that action on the screen.

This type of salute went entirely against regulations, but since Tatsuya was an irregular, the standards were slightly relaxed.

“Next subject. Special Lieutenant, rumors say that you are joining this summer’s Nine Schools Competition?”

“……Affirmative.”

Tatsuya hesitated for a split second, but given the circumstances, the fact that he only hesitated for a “split second” was quite an accomplishment.

It was less than three hours after he had been confirmed as a member of the Technician’s Team.

Knowing that asking was fruitless, Tatsuya put a lid on his curiosity and refrained from asking how the Major got the word.

“The arena is located in southeast sector of the Fuji Exercise Grounds, so this is only customary…… That being said, Tatsuya, stay on your guard.”

Kazama’s everyday speech was already abrupt, but today’s seemed even more so than usual.

He wasn’t referring to Tatsuya by rank, surname, or alias, but calling him directly by name, which signified that he was warning Tatsuya as an old friend rather than a superior officer. After obtaining the information intercepted by the military’s intelligence network, he wasn’t alerting the police or the general public, but a mere high school student without any social standing. This was highly odd.

Tatsuya focused all his attention as he continued to listen.

“There are suspicious circumstances surrounding that area, with signs that we have illegal aliens in the area.”

“Did someone infiltrate the military’s exercise grounds?”

“Quite lamentable indeed. Also, several witnesses claimed seeing East Asian members of an international crime syndicate in the area, which did not occur this time last year. Based on the timing, it’s very likely they have something planned for the Nine Schools Competition.”

It’s just a high school intramural competition…… Tatsuya was about to say this aloud, before switching to another tack.

Even if they were high school students, this country’s elite young Magicians were about to publicly compete against one another.

For example, if there was a major terrorist attack using explosives during the awards ceremony, that would severely impact this country’s talented personnel.

“You mentioned an international crime syndicate?”

This was not the same type of organization as Blanche (pretending to be an anti-magic political organization) that Tatsuya encountered in April. If this was a criminal syndicate, then they shouldn’t have any interest in causing unnecessary harm. Terrorism was another thing altogether. Kazama was a soldier, so he shouldn’t have had any experience dealing with international crime syndicates.

How did he figure out their identity?

“I asked Mibu to give me a hand. You probably know him.”

“The father of First High’s Year 2 student Mibu Sayaka?”

“Exactly. After retiring from the military, Mibu transferred to Internal Affairs (Cabinet Agency of Data Supervision). He’s currently Chief of Foreign Affairs, specifically international crime syndicates.”

“……I’m surprised.”

Tatsuya wasn’t merely parroting back, he was honestly surprised.

Tatsuya was astounded that the Major would reveal the identity of one of his sources of intelligence over the telephone so easily; the Cabinet Agency of Data Supervision generally remained neutral between politics and the military so they weren’t particularly friendly with the military, yet the Major simply asked them for assistance in a clear-cut manner, which also amazed Tatsuya. However, what floored Tatsuya the most was that the daughter of a foreign intelligence expert actually became the accomplice to a terrorist organization affiliated with foreign countries and the father who was the chief of foreign affairs merely turned a blind eye to the situation. Salutary neglect, much?

“Criminal syndicates and underground terrorist cells are handled by different departments. Tunnel vision on their own affairs is a common fallacy in government agencies.”

The reason why Kazama was able to accurately mirror Tatsuya’s thoughts, rather than due to their long friendship, was more because Kazama could also read between the lines and thus resonate with Tatsuya.

“However, information from areas within his expertise is trustworthy. According to Mibu’s calculations, these might be members from the criminal syndicate based out of Hong Kong called ‘No Head Dragon’. Currently, their objective remains unknown and we will let you know as soon as this changes.”

“Thank you, Major.”

“I won’t see you tomorrow, but we may meet up at Fuji.”

“I look forward to that meeting.”

“Likewise…… Ho, we talked too long. The new rookie is starting to panic, so it’s about time for me to hang up.”

The web police probably detected traces of the network invasion. Based on this assumption, it was too ambiguous for Tatsuya to tell whether he should praise the skills of the web police or lament over the skills of Kazama’s subordinates.

“Make sure to greet your sensei for me.”

“Understood.”

“Goodbye.”

Tatsuya wasn’t able to reply before the screen turned blank.

“That was probably a broad hint that I should make contact with sensei……”

Then, how much was he supposed to reveal? The face of his sensei who owned the title of head monk, but was more appropriately described as “imposter” floated into Tatsuya’s mind as he slightly sighed.




“Onii-sama, if you don’t mind, would you like some tea……?”

Sometime after closing the door leading to the living room, Miyuki’s voice came floating in.

She appeared to be trying to avoid eavesdropping on the conversation, so she waited in the kitchen until Tatsuya finished his conversation.

Originally, Miyuki occupied a much more privileged position than Tatsuya and possessed the right to listen in on any military or foreign secrets, but the little sister never exercised that right before her elder brother.

Tatsuya silently padded towards the kitchen and opened the door before Miyuki could ask again.

As expected, Miyuki stood there stiffly with her eyes wide open, with a tray that had a tea kettle and some silverware and snacks perched on top.

“……Onii-sama, please don’t scare me like that, you could’ve said something…… I can’t believe you moved silently just to laugh at Miyuki’s terrified expression. Onii-sama is bullying me.”

“Sorry, sorry.”

Miyuki turned her head aside with a huff. Tatsuya smiled as he took the tray from her hands while apologizing every step of the way.

“But I wasn’t trying to bully you, I just thought that you were carrying something heavy so I rushed over. I certainly don’t want my cute little sister to haul around heavy objects.”

“……I know very well that this is a fabrication…… But I’ll just let Onii-sama mislead me this one time.”

Even if she maintained her displeased expression, the corners of her mouth relaxed slightly.

It only took one word from Onii-sama to calm her down.

But Miyuki was perfectly willing.

“Black tea today?”

“Yes, I bought some excellent summer extract and I thought occasionally having tea would be nice.”

Tatsuya nodded in response to Miyuki and returned to the table before sampling the tea cup.

“Muscatel, quite rare…… It must’ve taken you some time and effort to get this, right?”

“No, it was really a coincidence…… As long as Onii-sama is happy, then that is the highest praise for Miyuki.”

Tatsuya slowly took a sip and let out a satisfied smile. Seeing this, Miyuki smiled with a happiness that welled from the bottom of her heart.

“Hm, the tea is excellent and the butter biscuits look delicious. Did Miyuki bake these?”

“Yes, though…… They don’t look very nice.”

“Nonsense, I don’t mind at all, they taste wonderful.”

Miyuki ducked her head in embarrassment, but the sight of her Onii-sama raising the butter biscuits and enjoying them was enough to prompt her to raise her head and smile in happiness.

Tatsuya didn’t bring up the topic of Kazama’s conversation, and Miyuki didn’t ask.

Tatsuya was busy sampling his little sister’s exquisitely prepared snacks and meticulously purchased tea. For Miyuki, just the sight of her Onii-sama’s satisfied expression was more than enough compensation for any arduous task.




There’s no need to repeat this, but Miyuki was the publicly acknowledged honor student.

Not only was she talented beyond all belief, but she also was extremely diligent.

Besides taking care of her Onii-sama’s day-to-day life, she also studied until late in the night.

Today also, she studied until near midnight before shutting off the electric monitor and storing it in the table.

She wasn’t exhausted yet.

According to her experience, it was hard to fall asleep when going to bed in this stimulated state. This could be quickly remedied with the sleeping device, but Onii-sama frowned upon using the technology that nearly 70% of the country uses. Since Tatsuya objected to this technology, Miyuki would have no reason to use it.

Then let’s make another cup of tea to change the mood, Miyuki thought.

It was totally worth it for her to hunt down the best quality Muscatel, as evidenced by her Onii-sama’s delight with the tea. Simply reflecting on Onii-sama’s smile was more than enough for her to have a wonderful dream, but if she could see it one more time, and maybe even have Onii-sama rub her head, then that would be even better.

Miyuki was just heading to the kitchen, when a sudden thought crossed her mind when she stopped in front of the mirror.

Miyuki nodded slightly, then a slightly mischievous smirk formed on her face.




“Onii-sama, this is Miyuki, I’m coming in with tea.”

“Perfect, come in.”

Miyuki would bring tea or coffee around this time every night and her brother would usually thank her in an apologetic manner, but tonight he seemed to be waiting for her to appear, which slightly bewildered Miyuki.

Regardless, if Onii-sama was waiting for her, that was definitely something that pleased her.

“I was just about to go get you—”

—He got only that far before silence forcibly swallowed the next word.

When she saw her Onii-sama turn around on the chair and stare fixatedly at her, Miyuki felt a small shiver of satisfaction run through her. She carried the tray with one hand while the other lightly clutched the hem of the skirt as she playfully curtseyed.

“…………Ah, is this the uniform for ‘Fairy Dance’?”

“Indeed, Onii-sama knows very well.”

The miniskirt was formed by layers upon layers of dazzling colors that floated together and perfectly matched the tights that covered her beautiful legs along with the bright, leather boots.

The outer garment was open down on the back, made of a translucent material whose thickness was hard to tell. The lines were not embroidered, but naturally created by the fabric itself, allowing it to perfectly complement the bosom.

Beneath the outer garment was a shirt in the same vein as the leggings. No, maybe it wasn’t a shirt and pair of leggings, but an entire long-sleeved spandex. If there wasn’t the outer covering, it could very well have been mistaken for a figure skater’s uniform.

A pair of hair decorations with wings sprouting out the sides held her long silky hair in place, connected by a long thick band seen on most earmuffs.

Considering air resistance and chest protection, this gorgeous uniform was undoubtedly the uniform used for “Mirage Bat” — also known as “Fairy Dance”, one of the most anticipated magical events in the Nine Schools Competition.

“How does it look?”

Miyuki placed the tray on a nearby table before spinning around with a smile.

Even though the softly flowing miniskirt was very short, when matched with the fluttering hair dancing in the air it created an aura of impossible grace.

“Devastatingly cute, suits you perfectly, and your timing is excellent.”

Miyuki stopped twirling when she faced Tatsuya and grabbed with both hands the hem of her skirt in a deep curtsey as Tatsuya complimented her.

“Thank you Onii-sama for your praise……?”

Miyuki was 100% certain that her elder brother would praise her, so she only prepared one response, as one response was all that was needed.

However, she was unable to comprehend what Tatsuya’s last words referred to, so she altered her response to include a question mark at the end.

Miyuki straightened her legs and waist before “looking up” to the seated Tatsuya.

Just as she was about to direct her gaze towards the usual height to inquire the meaning of “your timing is perfect”, Miyuki quickly realized something was wrong.

She just as quickly grasped the reason.

Even though Tatsuya was seated, his gaze was still level to his normal standing height.

Miyuki swiftly glanced downwards, then swallowed hard.

The chair that was supposed to be beneath him — was gone.

Tatsuya’s right leg was crossed over his left and his right elbow was directly perpendicular atop the right knee, like he was stretching the upper half of his body forward…… As he sat in mid air.

“I also wanted Miyuki to test out this calculation device.”

Tatsuya maintained this position as he slid towards Miyuki until he was roughly an arm’s length away before stopping. He then uncrossed his legs and straightened his feet much like how he would rise from a chair.

With this series of motions, his physical body naturally returned to earth

“……Flying-Type Magic…… Sustained Gravity-Control Type Magic has been completed!”

She was only distracted for a split second.

Miyuki nearly pounced on her brother as she seized his hand in joy.

“Onii-sama, congratulations!”

This was one of the magics that Tatsuya had been researching for some time.

Among the Four Great Systemic and the Eight Major Types of magic, the first category is the “Speed/Mass” System.

This was morphed out of the simplest of Super Powers, commonly acknowledged to be most basic magic in modern systemic magic.

That being said, while Flying-Type Magic is theoretically possible under the Speed/Mass Systems — Sustained Gravity-Control Magic, even though the basic proposal existed since the early days of modern magic, it was never successfully developed in official channels before this day.

Today during lunch, Flying-Type Magic was the subject of considerable debate. Modern magic’s general consensus was that while the theory was sound, the practical application was impossible.

Even so, another cornerstone of modern magic laws was overturned before Miyuki’s eyes.

“Once again Onii-sama has turned the impossible possible! To be able to witness this turning point in history, and the fact that the person who accomplished this towering achievement is my elder brother, I am extremely proud to be called your sister!”

Her hands tightly clasping Tatsuya’s right hand, Miyuki looked ready to throw her arms around him, while Tatsuya gently covered his sister’s hands with his left.

“Thank you, Miyuki. Although they didn’t intend to use it solely towards flying, Ancient Magic has already reached this level of flying capability, but today we took another big step towards realizing the goal.”

“The flying abilities of Ancient Magic can only be used by a small minority of Magicians and are a unique ability that depends on the subject, right? However, isn’t Onii-sama’s Flying-Type Magic usable by anyone with sufficient Magic Power?”

“At present, I have set that as the first objective. I hope Miyuki will help me test this.”

“Delighted to!”

Miyuki’s eyes shone as she nodded quickly.



After listening to the instructions, Miyuki looked towards the newly maintained CAD in her left hand.

Just like Miyuki’s regular CAD, this was a model shaped like a mobile terminal.

However, the dimensions were much smaller than Miyuki’s originally tiny model and could be comfortably obscured within her slender palm.

The only similarity was the overall shape of the mobile terminal model.

This CAD was a Specialized Calculation Device.

Miyuki wasn’t familiar with Specialized models, but the operation was simple enough.

There was only a power switch and, once activated, the CAD would automatically absorb psions from the user in order to continuously fuel the Activation Sequence until the power was exhausted. On some level, this was a fairly barbaric item.

However, the psion consumption rate for the device had been lowered to the absolute minimum.

The purpose behind the design was to minimize the stress placed on the user.

“Begin test.”

Her throat quivered slightly from the overwhelming nervousness she felt.

The fact that her hand wasn’t trembling was enough for Miyuki to want to congratulate herself.

Even if the test failed, Onii-sama wouldn’t blame her.

Rather, Onii-sama would likely redesign the “Flying Calculation Device” from scratch.

She refused to allow her own inadequacies to increase her brother’s burden.

Miyuki thumbed the CAD’s power switch.

She knew without looking that the calculation device was currently absorbing her body’s psions.

Even so, the amount was small enough that she had to pay extra attention to detect it.

It was only at a slightly elevated level compared to the normal loss of excess psions.

By the time she realized this, the Activation Sequence had already been stored into the Magic Calculation Area.

Though she was forewarned by Tatsuya’s instructions, the tiny scale of the Activation Sequence still caught her by surprise.

With Miyuki’s technical ability, she was able to execute dozens of copies of the same Activation Sequence with ease.

Even if the scale was tiny, every critical detail was recorded within.

Miyuki felt that this was an Activation Sequence completely stripped of anything unnecessary to boost efficiency to the max.

The variables were inputted into the Activation Sequence, beginning Magic Sequence construction.

Generally, Magicians wouldn’t pay attention to these phases.

Magicians would typically use language formulas or images to properly formulate the desired phenomenon change, and then dive into the subconsciousness.

The Magic Calculation Area’s job was to transform the imagined reality into data for the Magic Sequence. The “variables” in the Activation Sequence refer to the portions that must be created from the Magician’s imagination.

Magicians can feel the Activation Sequences that have been absorbed into their physical body, just as they are able to sense the Magic Sequence being constructed within them. However, the construction process for Magic Sequences is partially involuntary and is not subject to conscious interference.

If this wasn’t the case, based on human limits of understanding and comprehension of data, there would be no way to create Information Bodies capable of influencing reality.

Miyuki imaged herself floating to the ceiling’s height.

All of a sudden, the bounds of gravity disappeared.

Her five senses lost touch with her environment as if her body had phased out of reality, causing Miyuki to panic slightly.

That being said, Miyuki’s soul was filled with a delight that far exceeded that paltry sense of panic.

She never knew flying was such a liberating experience.

She was almost envious of the astronauts that strode across the stars with 80% of this feeling.

She also pitied them for having to wear cumbersome space suits in order to enjoy such pleasure.

Miyuki earnestly wished to leave this narrow basement and freely soar through the skies.

“How is it? Is the Loop System too stressful?”

Her brother’s voice quickly pulled Miyuki’s mind back to earth.

Miyuki was terribly embarrassed that she was engrossed in the pleasure of flight during such a critical experiment.

Even so, this wasn’t the time for self-loathing.

Miyuki, you have to step up — Miyuki mentally scolded herself before answering her brother’s question.

“No problems whatsoever. There are no headaches or sense of exhaustion.”

“Excellent. Next is gradual parallel motion, get used to slowly accelerating yourself, then fly as you please.”

“Understood.”

Miyuki followed her brother’s instructions and imagined herself slowly floating parallel to the ground.

The tiny Activation Sequence automatically spread out and copied itself, constructing the Magic Sequence that changed the direction of gravity to parallel motion.

The design behind Flying-Type Magic revolved around using the Loop System to continuously invoke magic.

According to this process, as long as new conceptual ideas are not introduced into the Calculation Area, the variables would continuously mirror the original values.

With the Activation Sequence added into the self-replicating Non-Systematic Magic data near the final stages of the Magic Sequence construction process and allowing the Activation Sequence to be applied to the Magic Calculation Area, even if the CAD is not being operated, the same Magic Sequence can still be invoked — using the Loop System, that is. Thus, the same Activation Sequence, construction of the Magic Sequence, and the data variables can be endlessly plugged in. This is the truth behind Flying-Type Magic.

Taurus Silver’s magnum opus — “Loop System”, was the perfect complement to the Flight Calculation Device that Tatsuya invented.

“Is the magic disjointed?”

“Not at all. As expected of Onii-sama, the timing is simply perfect.”

The key to this system lies in recording the exact times the magic activates.

Humans are unsuited for such precise number management, so machines were absolutely necessary to fill this gap.

If the design stubbornly refused to take anything besides magic into account, then the system would be simply impossible.

Miyuki continued to follow Tatsuya’s directions and incrementally raised the spiraling speed.

She used the limited space within the basement to the maximum extent. She turned, maneuvered, and flipped as she danced in the air.

The softly floating skirt and long, silky hair followed the outstretched body to display absolutely beautiful curves.

At some point, Tatsuya forgot to objectively analyze the situation and simply stood there mesmerized at the wholly unexpected fairy dance.




Four Leaves Technology (the literal translation is “Four Leaves Technology”, but the official company records and brand name intentionally used only “Four Leaves”) — often shortened to FLT, had a CAD development center situated in the boondocks, nearly two hours away from Tatsuya’s house by public transit (it was only one and a half hours by electric bike, but they chose to use public transit because of the rain). Tatsuya had long since familiarized himself with this route and, precisely because he was overly familiar, the long and arduous ride only served to irritate him.

“Miyuki……?”

“Yes, Onii-sama, what is it?”

“……Never mind, I apologize. It was nothing.”

“Huh……?”

Unlike the labs near the main corporate headquarters, whenever Tatsuya came to this lab, Miyuki usually tagged along as well, so she was probably just as familiar with this route. But despite the dismal weather, her outlook remained much like they were on a picnic, causing Tatsuya to inquire to the reason behind that.

The reason he cut himself short after starting to ask was because when Tatsuya thought about it, he felt that this was a rather odd question.

Of course, Miyuki was quite confused, but her sunny disposition quickly returned, to the point that she was almost humming in joy.

However, the two of them had already entered the research lab, so she didn’t actually make any sounds.

This was the hub for all corporate related technical research, the veritable beating heart of FLT itself, with all the security that accompanied it. Not only were there cameras watching every angle, the number of deployed security personnel was also astounding.

Even so, no one halted Tatsuya and Miyuki.

They didn’t even bother to check in at the counter before walking down the window-less corridors that led to the deepest part of the facility.

Finally, the two of them arrived at a room with one wall that was covered in windows from the ceiling to the floor.

On the other side of the windows, a deep chasm extended nearly half a floor beneath the earth that was large enough to house a hangar.

Across this open space was another room with the same observation area.

This was the CAD testing center.

Over a dozen engineers and researchers were bustling about the office debating or manipulating various measuring devices.

“Ah, young master!”

Even though everyone was buried in work, someone greeted Tatsuya the moment he stepped into the observation room.

Which was quite rare — this was probably the only place — since everyone’s greeting was extended towards Tatsuya and not Miyuki.

The name “young master” was initially applied to Tatsuya because he was the son of one of the corporate higher ups with the ability to enter as he pleased, but was now the respected title directed towards their future leader.

Tatsuya was slightly embarrassed by this moniker and wished that they would stop referring to him as such, but he knew that everyone called him that out of genuine friendship, so he didn’t force the issue.

“Sorry for the bother, where’s Director Ushiyama?”

The respectful gazes directed towards her brother made Miyuki glow with pleasure, causing no end of people — there were very few males capable of resisting Miyuki’s smile — to get distracted from their work. Tatsuya allowed Miyuki to accompany him as he interrogated the first researcher in the white lab coat who greeted him.

The voice that answered this question came from far behind the crowd.

“Looking for me, Master?”

A tall but hardly fragile-looking engineer wearing gray work clothes threaded through the crowd.

“Director, my apologies for visiting when you’re so busy.”

“Wait, Master, please don’t say that.”

Tatsuya’s respectful greeting caused the engineer named Ushiyama to color and shake his head.

“It is your right to act casual, but these men are your subordinates, so there’s no need to be overly humble like this.”

“Not so, everyone here was recruited by our father, so they hardly answer to me……”

“What are you saying. You are the far famed ‘Mr. Silver’ himself and we are honored to serve beneath you.”

Every engineer and researcher who heard Ushiyama’s voice nodded in agreement.

This was Four Leaves Technology’s CAD Development 3rd Division.

The development team that created what the world called the “Silver Series”.

Currently, it is publicly acknowledged that the “Silver Series” is the defining work of FLT’s technical abilities. Once seen as rebels and renegades, the surplus employees from the technical department that made up the 3rd Division now held considerable sway in FLT after the advent of the Silver Series.

Thus, the engineers and researchers here swore eternal loyalty to one of the core developers — Tatsuya, who was “half” of Taurus Silver.

“Seriously though, I think that you, ‘Mr. Taurus’, are the actual leader of this group, right? It’s because you were always reluctant to accept the directorship that 3rd Division still doesn’t have managers and group leaders.”

“Please don’t say that, I’m not capable of being ‘Mr.’ or ‘Taurus’, I’m just an ordinary engineer who does the grunt work so that your ingenious theories can be facilitated. I’m the one who cannot stand the fact that my name is placed alongside the original developer. I’m not that brazen. It’s just that the young master is still an underage student, so your patent would be a difficult issue, hence why I had to throw my name into the ring.”

“……Without Ushiyama-san’s skills, the ‘Loop System’ would be impossible to realize. I am not nearly as capable in terms of hardware knowledge, performance, and creativity, so regardless of whether it’s skills or theory, the only thing that matters is that we are able to complete a model capable of mass consumption, correct?”

“Ah~ Stop, just stop. There’s no way I can beat the young master in a debate, so let’s get down to business. You didn’t just pop in to see us, did you?”

As Ushiyama scratched his head in surrender, Tatsuya relaxed his solemn expression and let out a deliberate smile.

“OK, Ushiyama-san, today’s test subject is this.”

Tatsuya intentionally kept his tone and motions casual as he pulled out a CAD shaped like a smart phone. Ushiyama stared at it for more than 10 seconds without blinking at all.

This was the T-7 model CAD that Ushiyama prepared for Tatsuya for a specific reason.

To upload software into the test model meant that……

“Is that…… the Flight Calculation Device?”

Ushiyama’s hands shook as he took the CAD from Tatsuya’s hands.

“Yes, the testing hardware that I had Ushiyama-san make is already loaded with the Activation Sequence for Sustained Gravity-Control Type Magic. With this test model it was easy to access and manipulate the system, making it very easy to use.”

“Then the test……”

“As usual, only Miyuki and I have tested it, but we don’t rate as normal Magicians.”

Everyone present, and it wasn’t just one or two either, who overheard them sucked in a breath and tensely stared at Ushiyama’s hands.

“……Akira, how many T-7 Models do we have in the lab?”

Finally, Ushiyama used a fairly calm tone to ask his subordinate.

Upon getting the answer “ten”, his half closed eyes abruptly sprang open.

“Damn! Only ten? Why weren’t they replaced!

What? Order them later, grab every model we currently have plugged into the maintenance machines and copy the system the young master wrote!

Hiroshi, summon all the testers! What? Someone is on break?

I don’t give a damn!

Drag them here by the neck if you have to!

Everyone else, stop whatever you’re doing and prepare for precise measurement!

Do you guys understand? This is Flying-Type Magic! This will change the history of magic itself!”

He was probably using the internal broadcast.

Not just in this room, even the testing room on the opposite side burst into action as even the researchers on break started working.



This indoor CAD testing facility rivals a large gym in terms of area and height. The communication line hung down from the ceiling and was attached to the back of the testing personnel.

The line also doubled as a lifeline if needed.

Floating-Type Magic has already become widespread and this facility had also tested that before, but Flying-Type Magic was on a whole different level than Floating-Type Magic, to the extent that their actual designs were fundamentally different. It was also different from leaping and slow-motion descent, a hitherto unknown magic.

The tester’s face was pale with anxiety.

New magics were usually created from already familiar magics, but no one knows where danger may be lurking.

There have been precedents where Magicians lost their lives due to tiny bugs in the Activation Sequence.

If they were using a brand new and (until now) unprecedented magic, no amount of caution was enough.

The surface changed to a shock-absorbing material and, once the suspension test was cleared, the preparations were finally complete.

“Start the test.”

After evacuating to the observation room — not just for the safety of the observers, but for the testers as well — Ushiyama gave the order to begin.

From below, it was impossible to see what kind of expression the tester wore as he put on his safety helmet.

However, the tester, who had amassed extensive experience as the primary tester before reaching age 30, visibly clenched his teeth.

Even so, he thumbed the CAD’s power switch without any hesitation.

“Confirm lift off.”

“According to the measurements, there is no reverse force putting pressure on the ground.”

Before the naked eye could make any confirmation, the personnel at the various measuring devices were already reporting in.

“Errors in upward acceleration within acceptable parameters.”

“CAD performance is stable.”

The tester’s body was gradually rising.

Now, they could clearly see that his feet had left the ground.

The line was sagging, proving that the tester was not hanging from the suspension device.

Inside the observation room, excluding the sounds of the machines processing data and reporting back, there wasn’t even the sound of clothes rustling.

Everyone forgot to move as they stared at either the scene before their eyes or the values displayed on the measuring devices.

“Upward acceleration still dropping…… and zero, now maintaining rising velocity.”

The tester gradually rose until he was level with the 3 meter high observation room.

“Upward acceleration entering negatives…… Upward velocity has reached zero, confirmed immobile.”

Up until this moment, this was still within the boundaries of what Floating-Type Magic could accomplish.

“Testing parallel acceleration.”

Someone…… More like everyone held their breath.

“Halt acceleration, begin 1 meter/second parallel movement.”

Without waiting for the measurement reports, it was obvious to the naked eye that the tester was currently moving in the air.

“It’s moving……”

“He can fly……”

The incredulous words only served to confirm that the sight before everyone’s eyes was reality.

“This is Tester #1 to observation deck, I’m currently walking in the air…… Belay that…… I’m flying, I’m free……”

The surprising transmission from the speakers released the emotions suspended by everyone’s amazement.

“Awesome!”

“We did it!”

“Congratulations, young master!”

The observers shouted in joy.

The tester was freely tracing flight paths in the sky.

Only Tatsuya remained immune to the fiery emotions of the people around him as he calmly observed the expressions around him and accepted their delirious well wishes.



“Are you all morons……?”

Ushiyama gestured helplessly at the testers that sprawled on the ground due to magic overuse.

This test ran massively over schedule and continued until all 9 testers were down and out for the count.

It wasn’t that there was a problem with the process, it was because the testers didn’t want to stop.

At their request, the communications line that also served as a life line was swapped for wireless communications so they could go completely off script and play hide and seek.

“How can you use Sustained-Type Magic for so long!”

Modern magic is almost always activated in an instant or over a short period of time.

Generally, magics with sustained effects are only valid within a specific time, so there are very few Magicians who can use magics that require constant activation. For example, “Sonic Blade” belongs to the Sustained-Type Magic category, but in reality, most users refresh the activation after each strike.

Until recently, magic that requires repetitive activation was seen as unique abilities for select Magicians and it wasn’t until the introduction of the “Loop Cast” system that the automatic replication of Activation Sequences in the Magic Calculation Area became available to the general public.

“You are responsible for your own actions, I’m not handing out worker’s comp.”

Thankfully, no tester exhibited symptoms of magic deprivation.

Since this remained within the boundaries of hilarity, Ushiyama snorted at the protests and walked towards Tatsuya, who was staring intently at the test results.

“Is there any area you’re concerned about?”

When Tatsuya turned around, his expression was a far cry from satisfied.

“Honestly, the areas for improvement are limitless…… But based on the current status, the stress for continuously executing Activation Sequences is still overly high.”

For some reason, a knowing expression crossed Ushiyama’s face as he heard this, and he glanced at Tatsuya and Miyuki, who was standing behind her brother.

“Of course, when compared to Hime-sama or the young master, these Magicians have a fairly limited psion count.”

By Magic Power standards, Tatsuya was on the tail end of Magicians.

However, Magic Power standards fluctuate with the advancement of magic and the passage of time.

For example, thirty years ago Activation Sequences weren’t as well understood as they are today, so the transition from Activation Sequences to the construction of Magic Sequences was so slow that it cannot be compared to today. Magic Sequence efficiency was also pretty low and, when compared to the current day and age, it required several times more psions to construct an equally effective Magic Sequence.

At that time, the standards for power of Magicians emphasized the psion count within the Magician’s body (which included both the physical body and the mental “body”) rather than focusing on the speed of Magic Sequence construction. By the old standards, both Tatsuya and Miyuki’s psion count would rate as top tier.

Thanks to the improvements in Activation Sequences, Magic Sequences and CADs, a limited psion count wouldn’t cause the same problems with magic invocation. Excluding “Non-Systematic Magic” techniques that directly released psions, a high psion count is only seen as a beautiful decoration now.

That being said, the use of Activation Sequence and construction of Magic Sequences still consumes psions and, even if each consumption is a small amount, hundreds or thousands of incremental amounts still add up to considerable stress on the Magician.

“We have to streamline the design for the CAD’s automatic psion absorption to make it more efficient……”

“……Let me handle that. If we rely more on the hardware portion than software, that should lessen the load somewhat. We could probably set the timing mechanism as a feedback loop as well.”

Ushiyama said this after a moment’s consideration, which Tatsuya responded to with a knowing smile.

“I was just about to discuss that with you.”

“I’m honored.”

Both of them revealed the exact same smile.




While there were a few hardware modifications still remaining, all in all the technical portion yielded a satisfactory result. Today’s most important gain was the verification that the average Magician is able to execute Flying-Type Magic with a CAD obtainable on the general market.

There was no time to waste. After organizing the results of this experiment, next week he would publicize the details regarding Flying-Type Magic under the name Taurus Silver. Speed was more important than quality here, because the impacts of “first in the world” and “second in the world” were completely different. “First” was also an incredibly powerful tool for dissemination.

On the other hand, the CADs specifically designed for Flying-Type Magic would have to be objectively redesigned from scratch, so they would probably hit the market around September (the end of the first half of the fiscal year).

With these two objectives established, the meeting adjourned.

Tatsuya headed to the rest area to collect the waiting Miyuki and began the long trek home.

Despite all the work that needed to be done…… more like he adamantly insisted on sending them off, Ushiyama scratched his head in an awkward manner.

“I’m terribly sorry, I did contact the Vice President, but……”

Regardless of whether it was during the experiment or after the confirmation of success, the VP in charge of all FLT R&D divisions — Tatsuya and Miyuki’s father never showed up at all, a detail that Ushiyama couldn’t get over.

“Don’t worry about it. It’s our day off anyways, and even if he’s at work, he should be at corporate headquarters.”

Honestly, from Tatsuya’s point of view, not seeing him was probably for the best.

As a matter of fact, Miyuki didn’t want to see him at all.

However, that was probably too much information for Ushiyama. Ushiyama knew that the siblings’ father not only held an important position in FLT, but was also the majority shareholder. Even if Ushiyama was a key developmental engineer, the skeletons in the manager’s closet should be kept far away from employees.

With this in mind, Tatsuya used this excuse as a response, but that only served to deepen Ushiyama’s guilty expression.

“……No, the VP is actually here today……”

Even though Tatsuya’s back was facing Miyuki, he could still feel his sister’s emotional turbulence as she frowned.

Tatsuya himself actually let out a breath.

Thank goodness they didn’t run into their father.

“As the VP, he probably doesn’t have the time to check every site personally. I hardly think that he looks down upon R&D.”

“No, that I understand. Also, the VP allocated a larger budget to us anyways.”

Tatsuya intentionally steered the conversation back on its head and turned around to comfort Ushiyama. It was a shame that he had to treat the even more nervous Ushiyama like this, but Tatsuya also didn’t want dwell on this subject.

As usual, fate had other ideas.

After the siblings said their goodbyes to Ushiyama and left the research labs, they encountered the people they least wanted to meet at the corridor leading to the threshold of the main area.

“Long time no see, Miyuki Ojou-sama.”

As the three family members silently stared at one another, the first to speak was actually the fourth person present. This man was known to Tatsuya and Miyuki, but the emphasis was on “known” and not “close”.

“It’s been awhile, Aoki-san. I would like to say long time no see as well, but I’m not the only person present.

Otou-sama, you look well, thank you for your phone call last time, but I think that occasionally greeting your own son isn’t grounds for divine retribution, is it?”

The smooth and lovable voice was tinged with barbs, but her opponent’s skin and defenses were proof against the rose’s thorns.

“Ojou-sama, forgive this one’s impertinence, but this Aoki serves as the butler and financial manager for the Yotsuba Family. Your request for me to greet a paltry attendant is against our house rules.”

“He is my Onii-sama.”

Miyuki was striving to maintain her calm tone, but Tatsuya was very clear that she was reaching her breaking point.

“Again, forgive this one’s impertinence, everyone in the house earnestly wishes for Ojou-sama to inherit the Yotsuba Family. He’s only Ojou-sama’s guardian, and thus stands on an entirely different level than your own.”

“Hold, Aoki-san, I understand that interjecting here is considered boorish, but choose your words carefully.”

Just as Miyuki was about to breakdown and scream, Tatsuya coldly overrode his sister’s words.

His voice was chilling to the extreme.

Even such contempt found no purchase on Tatsuya’s will.

Tatsuya’s heart was “forged” this way.

Rather than affronted, Tatsuya was more concerned that Miyuki would hurt herself being enraged on his behalf.

“It doesn’t matter. Although you are a mere attendant, you are still Miya-sama’s son, so I am forced to overlook this breach of decorum.”

So Tatsuya had no time to deal with his opponent’s haughty attitude.

“Earlier, you claimed that all who serve the Yotsuba Family wish for Miyuki to be the next head of the Yotsuba Family. I do believe this is an unfair charge to the other candidates, correct?”

In order to avoid letting Miyuki be subjected to the negativity projected towards him any longer, Tatsuya must continuously press the attack, forcing the opponent to yield without allowing Miyuki to interject in any way.

“I believe our aunt has not selected a successor, unless you are telling me that you are privy to our aunt’s decision?”

The shrewd and capable gentleman in the prime of his years that looked more like a lawyer than a butler was stunned into silence by the sixteen year old youth’s inquiry.

“If her will is decided, then I need to begin preparations for Miyuki immediately. This is an excellent opportunity today, so I would be most indebted to you if you can verify this.”

Tatsuya’s voice was perfectly even, without a single rise or pitch in his volume.

“……Maya-sama has not made a decision.”

Aoki answered with a suffering expression on his face.

Tatsuya intentionally widened his eyes to express his amazement.

“This is astounding! The fourth butler of the Yotsuba Family actually passed on his personal wishes in the guise of the family directive towards the candidates for succession? If so, who here is the one who violated the house rules?”

Tatsuya pretended to sigh as Aoki glared furiously at him, his face completely red. Tatsuya judged that Aoki’s position was now untenable, so he prepared to depart with a victorious message.

Unfortunately, that judgment was too naive.

“……That was no assumption. As we all serve the Yotsuba Family, it is a common feeling that we all possess. Even though we cannot see heart to heart, as long as we aim for the same goal, then we are all on the same wavelength.”

This was a fabricated excuse that abandoned all theory and logic. Even so, his opponent still prepared the forbidden poison for the last moment.

“You’re nothing more than a heartless, false Magician. You wouldn’t be able to understand.”

The moment Aoki spat out this malicious sentiment, the walls were suddenly covered in frost.

The air conditioning kicked into overdrive trying to restore the rapidly falling temperature.

Swirls of cold air congregated around Miyuki’s feet.

However, Tatsuya reached out with one finger on his left hand and, accompanied by the sound of a cassette player rewinding at high speed — a hallucination that only people that can sense magic can hear — the cold air vanished.

Miyuki’s face alternated between angry red and green before turning completely pale. Tatsuya gathered his sister into his bosom with one hand before directing a chilling gaze that cut like a blade towards Aoki.

“My mother was the very one who created this ‘heartless fake Magician’, the older sister of the Yotsuba Family’s current head Yotsuba Maya, she who was called Yotsuba and now Shiba Miya.

She used the forbidden Non-Systematic Magic ‘Mental Design Interference’, forcibly altering the area in the consciousness, most likely to create strong emotions called the limbic system by inputting a Magic Calculation Model, creating an artificial Magician. The one who designed this experiment was Yotsuba Maya, who had recently been appointed the head of the Yotsuba Family, while the one who conducted this experiment on her six year old son that had no magic skills was Shiba Miya.

In other words, to apply the word ‘imposter’ to me as the target of the experiment is to call the magic experiment conducted by the current head of the Yotsuba Family and her older sister as a fake. I’m sure you are aware of the consequences?”

Tatsuya gently held his beloved little sister who was sobbing into his chest. On the other hand, he continued to mercilessly press the attack on Aoki, who was responsible for driving his little sister into this state.

“…………”

“Tatsuya, stop.”

Tatsuya’s father, who had remained silent until now — Shiba Tatsurou, covered for the immobile Aoki who had been cowed into silence and stepped forward to halt Tatsuya.

“Don’t speak poorly of your mother.”

But his words were completely off topic.

This was done to avoid irritating the main house and to protect himself.

This corporation was secretly funded by the Yotsuba Family, so even though he was the majority shareholder thanks to the stocks from his deceased wife, the actual power of attorney still remained in the hands of the Yotsuba Family, hence it wasn’t surprising for him to speak softly around them, but……

Tatsuya almost broke into laughter.

“Tatsuya, it’s not that I don’t understand why you bear hatred towards your mother……”

And, this father couldn’t even read Tatsuya’s expression.

Tatsuya truly believed that, for the sake of everyone’s mutual mental health, it was best to leave as quickly as possible.

Even so, Tatsuya felt that he needed to add one extra comment before departing.

“Otou-san, you misunderstand, I don’t hate my mother.”

“Is…… Is that so……”

That was all that was necessary.

There was no need to tell him the words Tatsuya didn’t say.

Tatsuya’s heart did not possess the ability to “hate”.

He could not feel any strong emotions like fury, despair, envy, hatred, disgust, gluttony, lust, sloth, and…… love.

Never would he forget himself in anger.

Neither would he wallow in despair.

Nor struggle with envy.

Unknown to hatred, nor known to disgust.

Or fall in love with women.

To hunger, but not gluttonous.

To arouse, but not lustful.

To tire, but not slothful.

The unique magic that only his mother possessed in the entire world erased all the strongest emotions and urges from his heart.

He did not hate his mother.

Nor was he furious.

That was because he was “unable” to enrage and “unable” to hate.

The only “emotion” they left for him was intentionally left behind to bind him to the Yotsuba Family with a chain forged of duty.

Of course, this was not filial piety.

And so, Tatsuya cradled the sobbing Miyuki as they left the premises without a word of goodbye.





Chapter 3




One of the advantages of having a set classroom at school was that it fostered building interpersonal relationships.

Regional proximity and blood relations are both powerful impetus for developing bonds and, regardless of whether they are official or unofficial organizations, serve to differentiate and categorize groups within groups.

For the practical application of this sentiment……

“Morning, Shiba. I heard about it already, nice going.”

“Morning, Shiba-kun, great job.”

“Good morning, Shiba-kun, I’m rooting for you.”

“Hey, go for it, Shiba.”

……And so, even students who normally weren’t very close to him were voluntarily bridging out towards him through greetings and words of encouragement.

As soon as Tatsuya entered the classroom on Monday, he received a string of support from his classmates.

The reason why they did this was natural: Tatsuya was selected as one of the representatives for the Nine Schools Competition.

“The grapevine is quite active.”

“Yep. This was only decided last week and there hasn’t even been an official announcement yet.”

“Yeah, so where did they get the news?”

Leo, Mizuki, and Erika did not appear to be feigning ignorance, so they probably weren’t the culprits.

However, it’s not like those responsible were issued gag orders either.

At the time, only upperclassmen attended the meeting, so they likely heard the news from their club leaders.

“Speaking of which, didn’t they make the announcement today?”

Erika tilted her head to one side and asked, at which Tatsuya nodded in a solemn manner.

Including the technician team, the official roster for the Nine Schools Competition was finalized last Friday.

The original timetable called for the roster to be finalized two weeks ago, so they were obviously several steps behind.

The fact that the contestants were already decided may have been a blessing in disguise, since all the competition-use CADs and uniforms that usually took the longest time to prepare had already been assembled. The only bottleneck was that because the engineering candidates hadn’t been settled, all of the maintenance and testing work was yet to be done.

Miyuki was a contestant herself, but owing to the constant stream of preparation work she was entirely unavailable. For her, Tatsuya was willing to sacrifice anything, but still couldn’t dispel the notion that he was being railroaded.

“I think 5th period will be changed to an assembly, right?”

Mizuki said this as she gazed at the terminal screen set into the table before them that listed today’s class schedule.

All grades shared the same schedule with three periods in the morning and two in the afternoon.

Even so, besides labs, technical skills, and physical education classes, standardized classes (classes set as progression goals) advanced according to the student’s own pace. Modern schools allowed for personalized education to be displayed on the terminal screens in class and did not heavily restrict start and end times.

In modern schools, the higher the grade level, the less emphasis was placed on determining class time and break time. The fact that the school changed the entire 5th period into an assembly to properly send off the representatives was a clear sign of how highly the school viewed this event.

“Tatsuya-kun will also be onstage during the ceremony, correct?”

“Hm, yeah……”

Tatsuya stammered out a reply to Mizuki’s question because this was precisely the point of contention that plagued him.

“And Tatsuya is the only First Year student, right?”

Just as Leo said, the only First Year student accepted into the technician team was Tatsuya.

Experience in CAD maintenance was absolutely necessary, so naturally upperclassmen should be the ones selected for the technician team, except that Tatsuya’s skills were vastly different from the masses.

Of course, when taking into consideration that he was a pioneering expert in the development of CAD software, he would definitely be overqualified for serving as an engineer in a high school competition.

But, regardless of whether they were in his year or higher grades, no one was aware of this detail.

Only his sister Miyuki knew.

“Those Course 1 students look so~ very~ aggrieved.”

The Course 1 students were still smarting from the results of the finals and this selection would only serve to throw more oil on the fire. This was blatantly obvious even without Erika verbalizing it.

“But all the contestants are Course 1 students……”

That was Tatsuya’s perspective.

Since all the contestants for the Newcomers Division were Course 1 students and Tatsuya was only an auxiliary member, no one on the outside would comment on this.

—But for the people in question, this was insufficient to comfort the other Course 1 students that aimed to become Magic Artificers.

Tatsuya was rarely in a position that aroused jealousy.

He also lacked the ability to envy others.

His life experiences were not rich enough for him to observe all the minute details.

“There’s nothing they can do about it. Jealousy alone isn’t a good enough reason.”

So when he heard Mizuki’s piercing comment, Tatsuya was unable to formulate a reply.

“Relax, this time no one is going to throw stones or magic at you.”

At Erika’s overly extreme method of comforting him, Tatsuya could only smile wryly.




After 4th period, Tatsuya reported on time to the backstage, where he was handed a thin jacket by Miyuki, who arrived before him.

“This is?”

For all intents and purposes, this was a normal jacket, but Tatsuya still wanted to verify that.

“This is the uniform for the technician team. Please put that on during the ceremony in place of the actual uniform.”

The one who answered was Mayumi.

—With the expected answer.

Mayumi herself was wearing a western-styled sports jacket.

That was probably the uniform for contestants.

Miyuki, who was still in her school uniform, let out an expectant smile as she held out the jacket to Tatsuya with both hands.

A brief, mischievous urge flashed across his mind, but Tatsuya knew that resistance was futile.

Tatsuya frankly removed the jacket of his school uniform and hung it on the coat hanger prepared ahead of time.

Next, he slightly bent his knees and allowed Miyuki to help him put on the jacket.

Standing behind him, Miyuki tugged the jacket over her brother’s shoulders before looping to the front and adjusting the collar and sleeves. Afterwards, she took a step back to glance over her brother’s torso and letting out a wide, satisfied smile.

Tatsuya was largely aware of why his sister was in such a fantastic mood.

Her happiness was likely caused by the school emblem embroidered over the jacket’s left breast.

The emblem was styled after a flower with eight petals.

Miyuki’s uniform had the same emblem over the same location.

The emblem of First High.

And not a replacement either, but the symbol of a Course 1 student.

“Onii-sama, that suits you perfectly……”

The intramural competition uniforms were largely the same as the normal ones, which was natural since it was only intended to identify which school the contestants belonged to.

However, in Miyuki’s eyes, Tatsuya’s appearance was finally restored to its rightful state.

Tatsuya honestly couldn’t care less but it was precisely because he didn’t care that he didn’t want to spoil the mood. There was still some time until the commencement of the ceremony, so Tatsuya waited around wearing the uniform for the technician team.

Miyuki was completely mesmerized by the dashing figure Tatsuya cut in his uniform. She remained standing there without tiring in her uniform. Tatsuya gazed around him but failed to catch sight of Miyuki’s western sport jacket. Even with the copious amount of time remaining, Tatsuya still felt that she should get ready as soon as possible.

“Don’t you need to change?”

“I’m serving as the ceremonial assistant.”

Hearing Tatsuya’s question, Miyuki snapped out of her mesmerized expression to reply with her usual smile on her face.

In other words, this was the only time that Miyuki was excluded from the participant standing and served instead as the representative for the send-off party…… At least that’s how Tatsuya interpreted Miyuki’s words.

“Is that so, that’s quite a heavy responsibility.”

“Please don’t remind me…….”

There was no way she would shrink at such a marginal duty, but she still employed that weak tone and faltering gaze, prompting Tatsuya to smile softly and lay a hand on his sister’s head.

—The surrounding onlookers directed cold gazes towards the two of them.




The team members responsible for organizing the so-called send off ceremony got the event started on time, and everything proceeded according to plan.

Even if Tatsuya stood onstage, there would be no stones or magic hurtled his way — that was a given.

However, for him, this was a very foreign location.

The participants and engineers assembled into two lines. Among the technician team, only Tatsuya was an underclassman. All the others were upperclassmen, which naturally lent the feeling that he was the odd man out.

Thanks to Tatsuya’s performance during the selection meeting, he was spared the outright hostile or contemptuous gazes on stage.

That being said, it wasn’t like the gazes were friendly. Favorable evaluation does not equate to a favorable impression.

Regardless of how they looked at it, his acceptance onto the team was an unprecedented elevation and special treatment.

To top it all off, Tatsuya was presently garbed in the jacket with the coveted eight petal flower emblem embroidered on it.

Surely someone must consider this offensive, which inevitably led to further backlash that he could do nothing about. Beneath the luminous lights, Tatsuya calmly thought about this as if he wasn’t the principal.

During this time, they were introducing each contestant in turn on stage.

Mayumi was the master of ceremonies.

Upon being called, each participant would receive a special medal that concealed the ID crystal needed to enter the competition arena.

To improve the presentation, Miyuki was responsible for presenting the medal to each individual.

Just the contestants alone numbered 40 people (excluding Miyuki and Mayumi there were 38), so this was a very time-consuming process, but probably owing to her excellent upbringing, Miyuki maintained a sweet smile throughout as she smoothly pinned the medals onto each individual.

In such an extreme proximity that they could feel her breath, no male student was immune to Miyuki’s smile as they desperately tried to fight their blushing and shaky expressions.

If that was the case, this scene would undoubtedly rouse the ire of the entire female student body, but even the female students that received the medals had succumbed to flushed faces or faltering gazes, so no one in the audience (especially the upperclassmen) was irked and instead smiled in agreement.

The medals were not just presented to the participants, but to the auxiliary team as well.

After the tactical advisory team was introduced, it was finally the technical support team’s turn.

“Somehow I feel a little nervous.”

Someone next to him suddenly spoke to him, causing Tatsuya to slightly turn his head.

The male student to his flank also turned his head slightly, catching Tatsuya’s gaze directly.

The level of Tatsuya’s sight was slightly higher.

If he recalled correctly, this was the Year 2 student named Isori Kei. Of course, he was a Course 1 student (and Tatsuya was the only Course 2 student onstage anyways).

“Yeah.”

He was one of the very few that were openly friendly to Tatsuya.

This handsome youth possessed a mild temperament and, coupled with his slender figure, if he exchanged the pants for a dress, would perfectly fit the description of a “tall female student”. However, he was also First Place in Magic Theory for the Year 2 class as well as one of the foremost Magicians with technical skills.

As Tatsuya re-examined his “beauty” at close range, he got the distinct impression that one shouldn’t judge a book by its cover.

They were still on stage, so the conversation ended there.

However, even for a slower individual like Tatsuya, to be able to find one shining light of friendliness in this murky ocean of negativity was enough to lessen the gloomy emotions welling up in his heart.

As he felt his depression lighten, he had the excess energy to survey the audience.

Since there wasn’t any assigned seating in the audience, the student body naturally split into two, with the Course 1 students in front and the Course 2 students in the rear.

That being said, a few outsiders had managed to infiltrate the front half.

They probably detected Tatsuya’s gaze.

Erika vigorously waved at him from her seat in the third row from the front, which was close enough to be called front row seating.

Tatsuya was thoroughly astounded by this.

Taking a closer look, Mizuki sat next to Erika, with Leo on her other side and Mikihiko occupying Leo’s other flank. Even the faces behind them were all familiar.

In sheer defiance of the disapproving looks sent their way by the surrounding Course 1 students, First Year Class E stormed the front of seating and claimed a section for themselves.

As Tatsuya was drawn to their courageous actions, Miyuki arrived in front of him with a small cart before her.

Of the 40 contestants, 4 tactical advisors, 8 technicians and removing the master of ceremonies and assistant, there were a total of 50 people on stage. Forty-nine of them had already received their medals.

Last, but not least, it was finally the 50th person’s turn.

In other words, Tatsuya was up next.

Mayumi loudly proclaimed his name.

Was Tatsuya over thinking too much, or did she place extra emphasis on his name?





Tatsuya stepped forward to acknowledge the announcement.

Miyuki revealed a brilliant, melting smile — enough to cause Tatsuya to be worried about his sister’s mental status — and stood before Tatsuya.

Miyuki clipped the medal onto Tatsuya’s jacket.

At the same time, thunderous applause broke forth.

There was no need for any visual confirmation.

It was Erika and Leo leading the rest of his classmates in applause.

To Mayumi and Miyuki, who were responsible for directing the ceremony, this was an unplanned for ruckus.

However, just as the First Year Course 1 students were about to hush the clapping……

Mayumi and Miyuki seized the initiative to start clapping from the wings of the stage.

After introducing the last representative, the entire assembly started applauding.

This perfectly coincided with the applause for the entire team, which spread throughout the auditorium.




After the conclusion of the colors ceremony, the entire campus was completely focused on preparing for the Nine Schools Competition.

With the events they would be participating in settled, Miyuki spent every day practicing with Shizuku and Honoka until the last second before the campus closed.

Tatsuya needed to perform CAD maintenance at the same time he was assisting Miyuki with her tasks, so he was also occupied until late in the day.

Both Erika and Leo were affiliated with athletic clubs, so they were also drafted to help deal with the myriad tasks that needed doing.

Mizuki was the only one in the literary clubs, so this week she usually waited by herself for everyone else to finish.

Last week’s colors ceremony filled her with anxiety.

Even though there was no assigned seating, it still took a lot of courage to disregard that unspoken rule.
