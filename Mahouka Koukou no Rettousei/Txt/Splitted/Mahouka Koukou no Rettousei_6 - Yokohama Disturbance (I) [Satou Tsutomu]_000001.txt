Chapter 1




It was October of 2095. In order to achieve ’round-the-clock operation, harbor facilities have already been upgraded to automatic services, so there was essentially no one present. The vast majority of the personnel clocked in during the daytime, and, aside from a few security personnel, only machines were active at night processing the incoming and outbound ships as well as unloading cargo.

With the reduction in personnel, each harbor was being redeveloped to prevent illegal immigration, and was set at a prudent distance from the duty-free areas and city streets, thus prohibiting the sailors from coming ashore in those areas.

During the night, when only the automatic services were in operation, the areas forbidden to all ships extended beyond the shoreline for the duty-free zone. Passengers who wished to disembark had to wait until the morning when the dock personnel arrived. Therefore, there should have been no one present during the middle of the night.



However, around midnight, a group of people concealing their presence appeared at the Yokohama Wharf.

“We have illegal aliens of unknown nationality coming ashore from the small cargo ship in Cargo Pier 5. All personnel, converge on Cargo Pier 5 immediately.”

Once the directions came over the intercom, two plain-clothed detectives glanced at one another and broke into a run. Yet, their expressions were diametrically opposed.

“Ah ha, so they were there.”

“This isn’t the time to complain, Inspector!”

“But, Inagaki-kun.”

“Shut up and run!”

“I’m your superior.”

“But I’m older than you.”

“Ah ah.”

While returning an appropriate response to his older subordinate, Inspector Chiba Toshikazu quickened his footsteps. There were 700 meters between Pier 5 and Pier 3, where they were stationed at. No matter how hard they tried, this was still a two minute journey at least. Despite their bantering, Inspector Chiba and Assistant Inspector Inagaki arrived in 30 seconds.

This wasn’t a normal human’s speed.

Neither of them were normal humans. They were both Magicians.

“We are really undermanned.”

“Nothing we can do. Only police officers who are Magicians can handle criminals who wield magic.”

“In reality, it’s not, entirely, like that!”

As he said these unmotivated words, Inspector Chiba sprang into the air.

He was holding a bokken that was approximately one meter in length.

In midair, Inspector Chiba waved his bokken like a leaf soaring through the wind, and passed cleanly over the crowd of illegal aliens who were firing three round bursts from assault rifles with silencers attached. Setting aside his leg strength, no one would be able to achieve this sort of trajectory through the air without the aid of magic.

That irregular trajectory threw off the aim of all the illegal aliens who were trying to provide covering fire.

Towards the three Magicians standing in the back of the crowd hurtling long range magic attacks, Inspector Chiba slashed a spiraling attack.

Using Move-Type Magic that blatantly ignored gravity and inertia to avoid the aim of enemy magic attacks, Chiba used his bokken to knock them all out in turn.

On the other side of the crowd, Inagaki was using his handgun to take out the gunners.

Once Chiba joined the fray from the flank, over ten foreigners were suppressed within the blink of an eye.

While other small-scale conflicts broke out in other areas, they were quickly handled before the two could get there and offer assistance.

“Inspector, take the helm!”

“Eh~, me?”

“Stop dilly dallying!”

Seeing these partners, it was obviously the subordinate who was more proactive on the job. (More like his superior was too lacking in professionalism.) Even so, it’s not like he could bail on the scene right now.

“OK, OK. Then, Inagaki-kun, stop the boat for me.”

“…If I do that, I might sink this thing.”

“No worries. The captain will take full responsibility.”

“…Wow, he’s not taking the responsibility himself…”

He shrugged in disappointment while continuing to load bullets into his handgun.

His left hand pressed the switch on the handle and the targeting scope attached to the barrel of the handgun lit up.

Immediately afterwards, he used the Weaponized Integrated CAD — a revolver-shaped weaponized calculation device in the handle — and a Specialized CAD in the actual body began the Activation Sequence.

At the same time as he squeezed the trigger, the Magic Sequence kicked in.

Using Move and Weight Compound Magic to stabilize the trajectory and increase penetration, a metallic bullet traced the trajectory set by the Magic Sequence and pierced through the stern of the small ship moored off the coast.

A second and third gunshot rang through the night. The foam sprouting from the stern weakened. Based on the ship’s external appearance, the shots had successfully penetrated the accelerator on board.

“Nicely done.”

Leisurely praising his subordinate, a sound came from Chiba’s hand like a lock being undone.

Apparently, the bokken he was carrying was actually a sword cane.

With a brilliant blade of cold steel in hand, Chiba dashed towards the floating ship with an agility that matched Yoshitsune himself as he skipped over 8 ships in a row.

He swung his blade at the parked ship and rent the metallic cargo door in two.

The secret sword technique “Iron Breaker” from the Hundred Families’ Chiba Family.

This technique did not view the sword to be cast from iron and steel, but identified the “sword” itself as a concept and applied Move-Type Magic to the slashing motion with the aid of the Magic Sequence.

A “sword” identified as a singular concept turned into a molecular blade that couldn’t be shattered, blunted, or broken as it cut through all resistance along the slashing axis.

Once more swinging his blade to clear a path, the Chiba Family’s heir, Chiba Toshikazu, pressed on alone.



“Nice work, Inspector.”

“Seriously, this is what they call wasting your time and energy.”

The sky was already turning lighter as Inspector Chiba groused complaints as if the situation had nothing to do with him. Likewise, he didn’t berate his subordinate who was obviously trying to hold back gales of laughter.

After bravely charging into the ship, he found that there was no one on board.

It appeared that the illegal aliens had already evacuated from the bottom of the ship, leaving the gate open to allow water to flood in. The leisurely pace the boat was sinking at was exacerbated by the opening Chiba left behind for the wind to flow through, increasing the rate the boat sank at, and it was currently completely submerged in water.

“Looks like we don’t have any clues to which direction the miscreants fled.”

“However, their final destination is blatantly obvious.”

The young man who almost went down with the ship shrugged his shoulders at what his older subordinate wanted to say and gazed eastward towards the rising sun.




Directly before Inspector Chiba’s eyes was the wharf, which wasn’t far away, along with the renowned streets of Yokohama known throughout the nation.

A large well was situated in the backyard of one of the nameless restaurants along the streets. Despite the early hours, three well-dressed men were standing around it.

One of them was approximately in his twenties.

One of them appeared particularly handsome. Of course, this wasn’t in a feminine manner, but because he came from a line of breeding and prosperity. The well with an attached pulley he was watching was not meant for consumption but for firefighting instead.

The wall of the well directly below the pulley suddenly crumbled without warning. A soaked man squirmed out of the gaping hole followed by 15 others.

The middle-aged man who emerged last from the well bowed to the young man in greeting with a humble smile on his face. The young man put his right hand over his left breast and returned a slight bow.

“Everyone, please go get changed. Breakfast has already been prepared.”

In regards to the young man’s words,

“Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Zhou.”

The middle-aged man replied in a tone devoid of gratitude.

Still, the young man smiled regardless of the other side’s rude tone, and led the 16 men into the building.




The first new Student Council for the National Magic University affiliated First High had started roughly a week ago.

Currently, Tatsuya and his peers from Class E arrived at the cafeteria for their lunch break.

He had dined in the Student Council Room before, but that was Mayumi (largely) abusing her power.

In addition, he didn’t plan on making it a habit to eat lunch in the Student Council Room every day. With the new Student Council in session, Tatsuya also came to the cafeteria to eat.

However, a natural result of this was that Miyuki also started dining in the cafeteria. Add in their mutual friends, and a lively luncheon had become a regular event since the start of October.

That being said, since Tatsuya, Erika, Leo, Mizuki, and Mikihiko were in a different class than Miyuki, Honoka, and Shizuku, the first group that arrived would reserve a table. Today, Tatsuya and company seemed to be waiting for Miyuki’s group.

“Sorry for the wait, everyone.”

“No worries; good work today.”

They waited for approximately ten minutes after Miyuki sent word ahead of time to Tatsuya that she would be delayed due to Student Council business. Seeing Miyuki intentionally bow in apology in front of him, Tatsuya smiled as he reassured her as was well. Completely heedless of this eye-catching behavior, Honoka seemed to receive some sort of signal and also huddled down as she spoke to Tatsuya.

“My apologies, Tatsuya-kun. They were late because of me.”

After the night of confession at Ogasawara during their summer vacation, Honoka’s responses and facial expressions towards Tatsuya had only intensified. Naturally, Tatsuya was aware of this, but he chose not to mention this. Now, if he wanted to be more proactive about this, he should probably smile a little — even a wry one would do — but Honoka’s frail and oversensitive reactions might make it seem like Tatsuya was intentionally abusing her, which wasn’t good for her mental state anyway. Hence, he didn’t have a good solution at this moment. It’s not like he could explain every time that this was born out of a misunderstanding, so Tatsuya simply gave up on the current situation and took a completely passive stance.

“Please don’t be concerned on that account. Anyone who just started a new job usually encounters a few difficulties.”

In Tatsuya’s eyes, Honoka believed that her personal mistake led to everyone’s disappointment, and that was why she seemed so down. Did she really believe she was incapable? While Tatsuya didn’t believe that for a second, he still diligently tried to reassure Honoka with comforting words.

“Yeah, no need to worry about that.”

“It’s only been a week.”

Erika and Leo unexpectedly displayed their sensitive sides and chimed in along with Tatsuya.

Seeing everyone wearing a “Don’t worry about it” smile, Honoka sat down with trepidation.

“However, today really wasn’t Honoka’s fault, Onii-sama. The Faculty Office suddenly asked to see ‘all the records from two years ago,’ so we had to bring up all the data from the Student Council Room before third period ended. We even got Shizuku to help us.”

Miyuki smiled as she also provided support, but, for some reason, this made Honoka shrink even more on her chair.

“But…didn’t Miyuki find it very quickly; meaning I’m the one who’s lacking…”

“Me too. If Honoka’s a turtle, then I’m a snail.”

Shizuku’s comment didn’t have any ulterior meaning.

“…After all, Miyuki had been using this system since April. Honoka just joined the Student Council, and Shizuku is an outsider… Miyuki has a giant head start on you in terms of experience. It can’t be helped if you take some time to get used to the system.”

So Tatsuya directed his comment towards Honoka’s nonmalicious description as a “turtle,” and once again reassured Honoka and Shizuku.

Still, based on the aforementioned comment, with the election of the new Student Council, Honoka had also joined the executives on the council.

The new Student Council consisted of President Nakajou Azusa, Vice President Shiba Miyuki, Secretary Mitsui Honoka, and Accountant Isori Kei. (First High’s Accountant also comprised the “supervisor” role and was traditionally appointed by the President.)

In reality, Azusa privately offered Tatsuya the role of Vice President. Of course, Tatsuya immediately turned her down, but the one who fought against this even more fiercely than himself was the new Chairperson for the Public Moral Committee, Kanon.

Her words were, “If Shiba-kun left, then the board’s paperwork simply can’t be finished”.

Kanon directly pronounced this declaration in front of Azusa and Tatsuya, but when he heard this, Tatsuya was “flabbergasted.”

By all rights, he was on active duty and not a pencil pusher.

Scratch that, technically, all members of the Public Moral Committee were on active duty, and were all responsible for doing paperwork.

That was how Mari wrote it on the transfer papers she handed to Kanon.

Tatsuya personally recorded the documentation, so there could have been no mistake.

However, Azusa nodded seriously at Kanon’s announcement.

Tatsuya had a headache brewing at the “misunderstanding” of these two upperclassmen. Still, even without Tatsuya’s thoughts on the matter, Azusa pressed for Tatsuya to join the Student Council despite Kanon’s resistance. To state it plainly, she didn’t have the confidence to hold Miyuki at bay without Tatsuya, but it wasn’t like Miyuki could leave the Student Council either.

Tatsuya’s head was seriously starting to hurt now.

In the end, they completely disregarded the person in question as Azusa and Kanon hammered out a compromise. Tatsuya would remain with the Public Moral Committee until the end of the school year, and would transfer to the Student Council in April. To the end, they never sought Tatsuya’s opinion…

(…My head hurts just thinking about that.)

The moment he said, “…just joined the Student Council,” he remembered what happened a year ago and the headache associated with it.

Instinctively, he followed the gaze on him and found Miyuki watching him with concerned eyes.

Mentally sighing at his sister’s sensitivity, Tatsuya visually signaled for her not to worry and moved his chopsticks again.




“Onii-sama, are you here?”

After school, Tatsuya visited the reference room in the basement of the library. Hearing his sister call out to him, he pulled himself out of the world of numbers and data and returned to reality.

“Miyuki, I’m over here.”

Tatsuya raised his head from the terminal he was reading and waved Miyuki over.

Wireless communication was impossible in this reference room. Not only would the walls absorb the majority of the electronic waves, there were also signal dampeners in place.

The goal, of course, was to prevent data theft.

This reference room contained information deemed unsuitable to be published, highly dangerous materials, or papers containing ideas and concepts that went against mainstream beliefs and could easily influence students negatively. These documents were physically stored in the magic universities before transporting digital copies here and stored in independent databases separated from the outside world. In theory, the files could be freely accessed, but removing them was absolutely forbidden. Of course, making private copies of these protected files was also forbidden.

Given the nature of the materials in question, the overwhelming majority was not pertinent to class, very few individuals actually used this resource. It was more appropriate to say that the usual volume of traffic was zero. However, in the past half a month, Tatsuya had set a new record for visiting the reference room.

Even though he waved Miyuki over, Tatsuya didn’t leave the terminal. Miyuki understood why, so she walked over to Tatsuya’s side.

“What are you looking at?”

Arriving at Tatsuya’s side, Miyuki was drawn towards the screen he was gazing at and couldn’t help but ask.

“Data records on Alexandrite.”

In regards to Miyuki’s question, Tatsuya replied without hesitation just as usual. No matter how he treated others, Tatsuya had nothing to hide from Miyuki. The subject of this investigation was also something that Miyuki was well versed in.

“Have you been looking for alchemical documents this entire time…?”

Right now, he hadn’t divulged the connection between that topic and the purpose behind it to Miyuki, hence her current state of confusion.

“I want to understand the basis behind alchemy, but just the nature and creation process of the ‘Philosopher’s Stone.’ Of course, there are plenty of documents citing the creation of a Philosopher’s Stone as the definitive goal in alchemy.”

“Transmutation… You’re not thinking of challenging this area, are you.”

For modern magic, transmutation currently remains an impossible task. While Flying-Type Magic was also once thought to be impossible, the actualization of transmutation exists on a completely different level of difficulty. Miyuki once heard Tatsuya say, “There is a very low possibility of actually achieving true transmutation.”

“Of course not.”

At Miyuki’s question, Tatsuya laughed lightly in denial.

“In the narrowest sense, the Philosopher’s Stone differs from the medicinal field and is the catalyst that transmutes poor metals to precious metals. Right now, what material the catalyst is created from is secondary to its purpose as the tool to activate spells.”

“If the Philosopher’s Stone is a catalyst similar to the catalysts we use on a daily basis, then……”

“According to legend, transmuting poor metals to precious metals is only possible with the Philosopher’s Stone. If no other magical process is required to achieve transmutation beyond possessing the stone, then the conclusion must be that the Philosopher’s Stone possesses the ability to store Magic Sequences.”

“Storing Magic Sequences?”

Seeing Miyuki stare at him wide-eyed in shock, the smile had long since faded from Tatsuya’s face.

“Since many Magicians were invited to test Flying-Type Magic before it hit the market, even if there were some adjustments, the actualization of Flying-Type Magic already established the key for the continuous activation of Gravity Control-Type Magic.”

Tatsuya released the Activation Sequence for Flying-Type Magic at no charge precisely to take advantage of this point. General consensus stated that once a party obtained access to a spell, they would immediately put it to use. Especially for devices already equipped with this Activation Sequence, the sooner it could be obtained the better. Besides the requests to FLT for Flying-Type equipment from corporations within the country, countries with friendly relations like the USNA, also made similar petitions. From the observation data, FLT received copious research data from many high class Magicians using Gravity-Type magic, which eventually fell into Tatsuya’s hands.

“Gravity Control-Type Magic is a viable solution to sustainable nuclear fusion, but that becomes meaningless if a Magician is required to constantly supply magic. This would be like saying a Magician is a component of the nuclear fusion reactor and simply a weapon component.”

Sustained Gravity Control-Type Magic was one of the three great hurdles in Gravity-Type Magic leading up to the development of a thermonuclear fusion reactor. Here, Tatsuya was raising one possible solution to this problem.

This was too deep for Miyuki to comprehend completely, but she got the overall gist of what her brother was suggesting.

“Magicians are essential for the initial activation, but, at the same time, the system doesn’t completely bind the Magician in place. To achieve this, magic needs to be sustained at a rate that can be calculated by days as a unit, which requires a method of storing the Magic Sequence that can sustain magic without having a Magician present. While both options are worth pursuing, from a safety perspective the latter is the more viable proposal.”

“So that’s why you are researching the Philosopher’s Stone.”

The general consensus that Tatsuya spoke of wasn’t just a pipe dream, a point that he was perfectly well aware of. Thus, he felt slightly awkward when Miyuki adopted an utterly trusting expression as she nodded deeply at his words. With that feeling, Tatsuya changed topics.

“Speaking of which, Miyuki, did you need me for something?”

Even though this question was phrased to cover his own discomfiture, his remark was dead on the money.

“Ah! That’s it! Onii-sama, Ichihara-senpai was looking for you. She wanted to talk to you about next month’s thesis competition.”

“Where is she?”

Tatsuya didn’t ask for any specifics as he shut down the reading terminal. That being said, he bore some part of the responsibility for leading the conversation into another direction, so he was in no position to ask that, especially given their lack of time.

“She’s in the preparation room for Magic Geometry. She said she would wait for you near Tsuzura-sensei’s desk.”

“Got it. Sorry about this, Miyuki, but please return the keys for me.”

“Please leave that to me.”

Tatsuya rose from the chair and handed the keycard to Miyuki. Miyuki happily took the keycard from her Onii-sama like a delighted puppy that was bestowed a prize.

Seeing his sister reveal that sort of expression without a hint of shame, Tatsuya didn’t choose to reprimand or complain as his face softened. Objectively speaking, he was forced to admit that he spoiled his sister too much.




Tsuzura Kazuo, the Magic Geometry instructor for the National Magic University affiliated First High, was responsible for technical skills instruction for Year 2 Class B. He was a visiting professor lent to First High from the National Magic University.

As a prodigy who obtained the rank of professor in the Magic University at a young age, he drew considerable spite for his overly free attitude towards research, and was forcibly relocated to the school to “earn some experience as an educator.”

Still, the man in question didn’t mind in the slightest and was even overjoyed that he could now “pursue research, unfettered, and without further concerns.” Precisely because of his personality, not only did he adopt a cold attitude to the friction between Course 1 and 2 students, he even wished for the students to completely abandon this differentiation altogether — except he may have neglected the students’ own opinions.

His family hailed from one of the Hundred Families, and was granted the right to use a number in the Tsuzura name (Tsu refers to twenty). The Tsuzura and Isori Families both produced many exceptional researchers who freely exchanged research findings and remained national authorities in the field. Even Hattori’s favored Compound Magic bore fruit after tutelage under Tsuzura-sensei.

…That was Tatsuya’s impression of Tsuzura-sensei.

By the numbers, Tsuzura-sensei was undoubtedly an oddball. Regardless of whether this was true or false — Tatsuya was quickly about to experience the man’s true face.



By the time Tatsuya reached the preparation room for Magic Geometry, Tsuzura-sensei was the only instructor present.

Most likely because they felt ill at ease in this room, Tatsuya thought.

The instructors hired by this school were all exceptionally talented.

Of course these people also took great pride in their personal abilities, but when compared to a prodigy who earned his position as the assistant professor in the Magic University during his twenties, anyone’s confidence would take a hit. The more someone relied on their personal talent, the more they felt pressured by someone who displayed an even greater talent and ability.

He could sympathize with that feeling; except this feeling manifested in areas other than magic.

Setting aside whether Tatsuya’s speculation was correct, it remained an undeniable truth that there were no other instructors present save Tsuzura.

The three people waiting for him in the Magic Geometry preparation room were Tsuzura, Suzune, and Isori.

“You know about the thesis competition hosted by the Magic Association held at the end of the month, correct?”

After exchanging greetings, Tsuzura cut to the chase.

“I am unfamiliar with the details.”

At this conservative answer that held something back, Tsuzura nodded slightly.

“The Thesis Competition isn’t as conspicuous as the Nine Schools Competition, so it’s not surprising that a Year 1 student like yourself remains ignorant of the details. Likewise, in terms of numbers, the Nine Schools Competition requires a large body of 52 members to participate, while the Thesis Competition only needs a small team of three.”

The sheer difference in numbers may be shocking, but after calmly taking into account this only involved writing a thesis and its subsequent presentation, they simply didn’t need very many people for this task. If all they needed was extra hands to help develop the props for the report, anyone on campus would do, so they wouldn’t be specifically invited to join the team. Too many chiefs in one building would actually make it harder to get things done.

The fact that only three students from the entire school were selected came as a small surprise, but was well within the limits of common sense, Tatsuya ruminated.

“Now, then onto the main subject. Shiba-kun, can we count on you to represent First High in this year’s Thesis Competition?”

Naturally, Tatsuya wasn’t able to respond immediately. After all, this question more or less came out of the blue.

“…You want me to join?”

Even though Tsuzura’s words left little room for mistake, Tatsuya couldn’t help but ask back on reflex.

The “National High School Magic Theory Thesis Competition,” hosted by the Japanese Magic Association.

Despite the name implying all high schools in the country, in reality the only high schools providing official education in magic theory were the nine high schools affiliated with the magic university, so this was really a competition between those nine schools. If the Nine Schools Competition was a “practical” contest, then the Thesis Competition was undoubtedly the “literary” complement.

“Exactly, you.”

This slightly polite tone was probably his personality coming into play. Tsuzura adopted a dramatic pose as he nodded in reply.

“Originally, we planned to have Ichihara-san and Isori-kun, as well as Hirakawa-san from Year 3 Class C… Unfortunately, Hirakawa-san has hit a rough patch recently, and even submitted a withdraw petition last week. The good news is that we managed to persuade her otherwise, but she’s still in no condition to compete now. Thus, we came to you.”

Tatsuya was vaguely familiar with the name Hirakawa from Year 3 Class C.

The technician responsible for CAD calibration in the sabotaged Mirage Bat event of the Nine Schools Competition for Kobayakawa seemed to be a Year 3 female student named Hirakawa.

“But why pick a Year 1 student like myself? Aren’t the representatives decided by the Thesis Selection Committee?”

Tatsuya finally recalled the rumor spreading around the start of June regarding the selection of the thesis team.

Since that was during the last stages leading up to the development of Flying-Type Magic, he didn’t have the spare time to devote to other details, especially scenarios that might drag him into the limelight, so he quickly forgot about it.

“After taking into consideration that the report preparations need to be finished simultaneously, you are the best candidate. Ichihara-san will share the details.”

After supplying a simplistic answer to Tatsuya’s question, Tsuzura swiftly left the room.

At the time, Tatsuya never agreed to this proposal. Apparently, the rumors that he didn’t care about students’ opinions were true. Nevertheless, Tatsuya didn’t appear to possess the power to veto this decision. Originally, he thought he was only being called in to help collect data, but that appeared to be a miscalculation. Still, no matter how he complained, that wasn’t going to help his current situation. In order to understand the situation, Tatsuya turned back to Suzune.

“I was the one who recommended Shiba-kun. I rejected all the other substitutes.”

(Ugh, rejected means…)

In response to Tatsuya’s inquiring glance, Suzune dropped this bombshell.

“…Surely every applicant spent considerable time and effort in their respective proposals, so I imagine a lot of people would be put out that someone like me, who didn’t even submit an application, was selected. Think about the people who were slightly behind Ichihara-senpai, Isori-senpai, and Hirakawa-senpai, and what they would think.”

“Sekimoto-kun is out of the question. He’s not suited for this task.”

Tatsuya didn’t have anyone in mind as he voiced his objection, but Suzune immediately launched into comment that bordered on a personal attack.

“Speaking of Sekimoto, are you referring to Sekimoto Isao-senpai from the Public Moral Committee?”

In order to prevent this from actually descending to that level, Tatsuya intentionally verified his identity.

“Hm, yeah… He and I come from radically different directions.”

As expected, Suzune simply felt that she went too far and reined herself in, as Tatsuya had hoped.

At this time, Isori interjected into their conversation.

“As sensei said, though the thesis composition and report preparation are done by a team of three; if all three are split by differing opinions, then they would never agree on the thesis’s direction, so it is integral that the task is split between one primary writer and two assistants. On this point, our school has decided that Ichihara-senpai will be the primary writer.”

At Isori’s explanation, Tatsuya nodded his head in agreement on two points. Differentiating between primary and supporting parties was mandatory, just as appointing the Year 3 student Suzune to be the primary also made sense.

“In other words… I am more suitable for the topic that Ichihara-senpai has in mind?”

That was the most likely possibility, given their current conversation, but what exactly allowed her to make that call? Plainly, Tatsuya had yet to attach his name to any thesis or dissertation.

“My thesis topic is the ‘possibility of developing a Gravity Control-Type Magic thermonuclear fusion reactor’.”

Tatsuya’s eyes widened at Suzune’s words.

“Indeed, this is the same as Shiba-kun’s research topic.”

While he felt that a high school student using “research topic” was a little overkill, it was true that sustained Gravity Control-Type Magic thermonuclear fusion reactor was also one of the objectives Tatsuya was pursuing. On top of that, he was still playing this close to the chest, so he shouldn’t have raised this with anyone else yet…

“…I see. The one spying on us at the time was Ichihara-senpai.”

“I dislike the term spying. Please refer to this as watching with interest.”

This far surpassed mere observation and bordered on outright eavesdropping, but Tatsuya didn’t make an issue of it.

During the incident with the anti-magic terrorist cell in April, Tatsuya had detected someone watching his two interactions with Mibu Sayaka, but he didn’t seek to identify the observer. Since the results spoke for themselves, there was no point making a fuss over this now.





“There are less than three weeks until the official commencement of the Thesis Competition. I believe that the only one who can provide adequate assistance now would be Shiba-kun, who also has a vested interest on the topic.”

“Did you ever entertain the possibility…that I was just using that as an example with Mibu-senpai?”

“I believe I am a sufficient judge of character to think otherwise.”

Tatsuya mentally and physically smiled in a wry manner at how highly he was esteemed.

“I understand. Since I stand to benefit as well, allow me to render my assistance.”

On one hand, Tatsuya wasn’t joking about the benefits on his end. On the other hand, Tatsuya was intrigued by whether Suzune’s proposal could actually solve one of the Three Great Puzzles, which would be all the better if his own design could be of use in some way.

“Then, what should I do now?”

“First, I would like to explain the Thesis Competition in detail. I hope Isori-kun has no objections, seeing as you’ve already heard all this.”

“No problem. You go ahead, Ichihara-senpai.”

Using her eyes to thank Isori, who had nodded slightly in assent, Suzune removed three portable blackboards from the retractable shelf and handed each of them one, keeping one for herself.

Portable blackboards were electric papers with wireless communication that allowed the user to view magnified presentation materials from the size of a normal piece of paper with one hand, without resorting to projectors in small conference rooms. Naturally, the frames contained color, but the display for texts and documents often utilized white letters on a black background, which was why the term “blackboard” was used.

Suzune attached her own data terminal to the blackboard and brought up the handbook for the Thesis Competition.

“As Shiba-kun surmised, the Thesis Competition is a platform to disseminate the research findings from Magic Theory and Magic Engineering at the high school level. Not only does this publicize the fruits of high school education, some of the students will also get the opportunity to present their research findings to the world at large. In addition, representatives from the Department of Magic Research will be on hand, and any thesis recorded into the Magic Encyclopedia will be adopted by the universities and corporations as well.”

Tatsuya observed the data streaming from the screen as he listened to Suzune’s voice.

“Usually, the date is set for the last Sunday each October. The location switches between Kyoto and Yokohama. The reason is, supposedly, because the main HQ for the Japanese Magic Association is located in Kyoto, while its primary branch in the Kantou region is in Yokohama. This year, the event will be held in the Yokohama International Conference Center.”

Tatsuya mentally ran through the calendar. Thankfully, he had nothing planned for the last Sunday in October, which was October 30th.

“Only individuals who were recommended by the magic high schools affiliated with the National Magic University or passed the thesis preliminaries in each school are allowed to attend. Currently, there is no precedent for someone to present their findings without being recommended. While the rules open the Magic Theory Thesis Competition to all high school students in the nation, this is the reason why so far this has been exclusively for magic high schools.”

Hearing Suzune’s explanation, Tatsuya couldn’t help but add in a few words of surprise.

“So there’s no precedent for a team to advance without receiving a school recommendation?”

“…Shiba-kun. I think it’s harder for normal high school students to compose a thesis that can be delivered in 30 minutes than it is for them to appear in Monolith Code or Mirage Bat.”

“Isori-kun is correct. Even from our perspective, without the aid from the Student Council and Club Groups, there’s no way we can do it with just the three of us.”

Tatsuya, who was used to writing technical guides, mentally murmured “Is that so?”, but didn’t verbalize his disagreement.

“The topic is up to us, but under the obvious condition that it shall not run counter to the public good and morality. Two years ago, a student proposed the theoretical development of a magic that could replace weapons of mass destruction, and was quickly censored by inspectors ahead of time.”

“Was someone seriously that audacious…”

Isori’s eyes widened as he groaned at that. This must be the first time he heard of such a thing.

Tatsuya understood what he meant. At the same time, he who was capable of wielding magic that surpassed weapons of mass destruction was in no position to point fingers at that particular student. However, just as he was inwardly mocking himself, another question floated into his head.

“…Censored ahead of time by the inspectors implies that particular thesis wasn’t publicized, correct? Since that paper remained under wraps, how did Ichihara-senpai learn about this?”

Tatsuya didn’t even think twice before asking that question, which for some reason cast an awkward silence over the group.

Suzune unconsciously turned away with a complex and miserable expression on her face.

No, if you don’t want to answer; these words were on Tatsuya’s lips when she sighed and replied back.

“…The one who wrote that paper was our school’s Student Council President from three terms ago.”

(Holy… Did our school have that kind of character…)

Hearing Suzune’s explanation, Tatsuya could only marvel in silence. Since the Thesis Competition was held right after the new Student Council session began, and Suzune joined the brass during the latter half of her first year, it was hardly surprising that she was privy to these details. Given Suzune’s current facial expression, evidently this previous Student Council President had many other “legendary” deeds.

“[Ahem…] Owing to that precedent, all final drafts, materials, reports, and blueprints must be turned over to the Magic Association ahead of time.”

Next to Suzune who had intentionally cleared her throat, Isori seemed to comprehend something as he nodded, possibly because this was the first time he heard all the details.

“The deadline is the Sunday two weeks from now. Though the materials have to be submitted to the Kantou branch of the Magic Association, the school will take responsibility for that. Taking into account the time Tsuzura-sensei needs to examine the contents, ideally we should have everything done by next week Wednesday.”

Even if they could finish the report preparation after turning in their materials, that left only ten days to compose the thesis itself. Given the remaining time, this was indeed a tight schedule. Still, why did they need Tsuzura to look it over? There should be many instructors on campus with a wealth of experience who were old hands at devising textbooks for magic education.

At this question that could not be verbalized (as insulting as it was to Tsuzura-sensei), Isori shrewdly answered aloud.

“Tsuzura-sensei is the instructor responsible for this year’s competition. Not only does he have to help out with the preparations for the Thesis Competition, he also has to deal with troublesome tasks like preparations for magic experiments. Generally, these things are left for younger teachers to do.”

“Despite his youth, Tsuzura-sensei is an extremely capable individual. We are very fortunate that we are able to receive instruction that far surpasses what we would normally receive in class.”

Doubly so for a Course 2 student, like himself, that normally has no chance of being personally instructed by the faculty. Not that Tatsuya actually said this.

Since the two of them — forget surpass, half the student body wasn’t qualified for actual instruction — had conveniently failed to notice this, there was no need to remind them again.

After detailing a few specific areas that demanded special attention, Suzune’s explanation drew to a close.





Chapter 2




Modern short distance public transportation was developed along the lines of carpooling, with large scale public transportation being replaced by smaller systems that accommodated fewer individuals.

Thirty years ago, this plan started spreading among the large metropolises as well as 80% of the medium sized cities and suburbs. The remaining 20% utilized private cars and had no need for public transportation.

In terms of going to school or work, large buses and cable cars that could transport large amounts of people had gone out of style, so the scene where high school students took the bus to and from school has almost become non-existent.

While Tatsuya really only went to school accompanied by Miyuki, he still shared the walk from the bus stop to the school with his friends. Even though he arrived later than usual to school, the usual crowd was still on hand waiting for him.

The predominant itinerary involved a simple walk to school, but sometimes they would make a quick detour to a cafe or fast food restaurant. Along the approximately one kilometer path to school, there were countless stores that boasted dining, books, school supplies, clothes, and especially materials related to magic education. Students and teachers from First High were not the only ones to frequent this area, since many customers took the tram from far away to come and shop here.

Within one of the more orthodox cafes where they were frequent fliers, eight people were sitting together.



“Eh? Tatsuya’s been selected as one of the representatives for the Thesis Competition?”

Today’s detour was because Mikihiko asked why Tatsuya was summoned to the Magic Geometry lab. Seeing Mikihiko burning with questions while they were waiting for the waitress, Tatsuya couldn’t help but notice a side to his friend as he briefly elaborated on the details.

Hence Mikihiko’s reaction was embodied by the previous comment.

Since he had already told Miyuki and Honoka when he picked them up from the Student Council Room yesterday, there were five people including Mikihiko who sat there with stunned expressions.

“Wait, I thought we only send three representatives from the entire school to the Thesis Competition.”

“Yep.”

At Mizuki’s wide-eyed question, Tatsuya calmly replied with a decisive answer. Their two expressions were like night and day.

“Just a ‘yep’…… Tatsuya-kun is completely lackadaisical about this.”

Mizuki was struck speechless while Erika stared blankly. On the other side, Leo supplied an amused smile.

“For Tatsuya, that would be only natural.”

“There’s never been a case where we sent a Year 1 student out for the Thesis Competition.”

“Not like it’s impossible either, eh? Even the faculty can’t ignore the genius who invented a brand new magic among us.”

Hearing Shizuku’s counter argument, Leo smiled and added a rebuttal of his own.

“Let’s stop it there with the genius talk.”

Rather than being embarrassed by that title, Tatsuya felt an irritation like someone poking him with a needle.

“Tatsuya really dislikes people calling him a genius……”

“Because that term is too casual.”

At Honoka’s amazed comment that was neither mocking nor filled with ulterior meanings, Miyuki replied in place of Tatsuya.

Tatsuya could only chuckle wryly at his sister’s reply, though he had to admit she was right on the money.

“No, that’s still incredible!”

Likely noticing the mood taking a turn for the worse, Mikihiko quickly chimed in to restore the balance.

“The winning thesis from the competition will be published annually in ‘Super Nature’, while a considerable amount of attention is still directed towards Second Place and below.”

“Super Nature” is a British research journal that is held to be the highest authority on modern magic. Unfortunately, the journal also contained themes on dictatorship that were inappropriate for high school students. Fortunately, everyone here who had read the journal, including Mikihiko, Tatsuya, and Miyuki, were all quite familiar with the name.

“Ah, but…… There isn’t a whole lot of time left.”

Mikihiko’s euphoric mood swiftly turned to worry as he stated this.

Shouldn’t Mikihiko also pay attention to these sudden mood swings? Tatsuya thought in surprise. Regardless, he kept these thoughts to himself as he nodded at Mikihiko’s question.

“We have exactly 9 days until the school turns in our paper.”

“That’s it!? That’s right around the corner!”

“There’s no problem at all. At the end of the day, I’m only in a supporting role. The lead writer has been working on this since before summer vacation.”

Seeing Honoka’s electrified expression, Tatsuya reassured her with a smile as he waved his hand a little. At Tatsuya’s answer, Honoka relaxed into a “You’re right” expression and heaved a sigh of relief.

“Even so, the fact remains that this is a pressing deadline. Did something unexpected happen?”

“One of the supporting upperclassmen’s physical condition suddenly worsened.”

Miyuki wrinkled her brows as she queried Tatsuya, who maintained his earlier smile as he replied with a simple answer. Even though he didn’t cut into the heart of the matter, there really was nothing to hide even if pressed.

Yet, Miyuki didn’t seem wholly satisfied with Tatsuya’s overly simplistic answer.

“That’s quite unfortunate, but even so this is certainly a last minute change.”

The reason apparently wasn’t why this situation occurred, but a mood issue.

“Indeed, even if the entire thesis had to be done from scratch, Onii-sama would still be the best candidate.”

Nonetheless, given that Tatsuya’s situation had already turned into reality, Miyuki was only looking for a reason to convince herself, which was perfectly in tune with her character. In Tatsuya’s eyes, even though Miyuki’s comment was fairly accurate, she was still thinking too highly of herself with this unconditional acceptance.

“That’s not entirely the case. We would have quite the conundrum on our hands if I was utterly unfamiliar with the field of Ichihara-senpai’s topic, but fortunately that isn’t the case.”

Thus, Tatsuya adopted a “smile and deny” tactic, but Miyuki didn’t seem very happy with her brother’s stance. Just as she was thinking of an appropriate rejoinder, a new question sprouted out from beside her.

“Hey, so what is the topic?”

Curious, Leo leaned forward as he asked this question. Despite the fact that all the young ladies watched him coldly with eyes that clearly said “Would you understand even if he told you?”, the man asking the question and the one answering him both ignored them.

“Technical Difficulties and Solutions to Sustained Gravity Control-Type Magic Sequence Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor.”

“……I can’t even imagine that.”

The questioner immediately retorted back, a prompt reflection of his current predicament.

“……That’s quite the grandiose topic. Isn’t that one of the ‘Three Great Puzzles in Weight Systematic Magic’?” Mikihiko groaned with a complex expression. To his side,

“Since Tatsuya was asked to join, I thought the thesis would be related to CAD processes.”

Mizuki expressed her thoughts on the matter.

“Ah, I thought so too.”

“Kei-senpai is also a member…… I think that this topic may be simply too difficult to have a chance at victory.”

Shizuku and Erika shared Mizuki’s opinion. Apparently, his friends were concerned on his behalf that this topic would prove too challenging for Tatsuya and high school students in general.

Which made perfect sense, since the Gravity Control-Type Magic Sequence Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor was not labeled one of the Three Great Puzzles just for nothing. In this situation, Tatsuya could only smile and muddle through.

However, among all the smiling faces, only Miyuki wasn’t really smiling.

Her smile didn’t reach her eyes.

Only she, who understood the significance of Sustained Gravity Control-Type Magic Sequence Thermonuclear Fusion Reactors, could truly appreciate how serious her brother was.




The siblings split from their friends at the station. They returned home to find a small limousine parked in their parking spot, which prompted the two of them to exchange a glance.

Tatsuya stepped forward and opened the door.

Seeing the rare designer label high heels in the threshold, Tatsuya gently cradled Miyuki’s shoulders as she stood there in utter silence with a stiff expression on her face.

As he supported Miyuki and stepped through the door, a light tapping of slippers rapidly approaching could be heard.

“—Welcome back. The two of you are always on such good terms.”

Hearing these mocking tones, Tatsuya swiftly narrowed his eyes as his hand that was holding his sister’s shaking shoulders tightened their grip a fraction.

“It’s been quite a while, Sayuri-san.”

Tatsuya’s chilly voice was a perfect match for his cool gaze.

This time, it was the petite woman who welcomed them who shook a little.

“Hm, hm. Well, that’s because I always wanted to be close to the office.”

“Is that so.”

Tatsuya nodded curtly at their stepmother who hadn’t stepped foot in this house for 9 months — in the siblings’ eyes, she was “their father’s second wife” — Shiba Sayuri.

Despite coming home, this household did not possess her room or bedding since after her marriage to their father, she had settled down with him in a suite in an upscale apartment complex five minutes from FLT headquarters and dwelt in married bliss together. Tatsuya only intended to slightly needle Sayuri for the fact that she had never lived here after marrying their father and her usage of this location as home.

Seeing their father’s second wife’s expression darken at the sarcasm, Miyuki actually composed herself. With her brother’s arm still around her, she slightly shifted around, utterly ignoring any other gazes on her as she pressed closer to Tatsuya’s slightly lowered face.

Normally, even with just the two of them, Miyuki would never commit such an embarrassing action that was wholly incompatible with her image. At this point, Miyuki had completely entered a state where bystanders held no meaning.

“I shall begin preparations for dinner immediately, Onii-sama. Anything in particular you would like?”

“Anything you make will be fine. There’s no need to hurry, so you best get changed first.”

Tatsuya didn’t even bother to glance at Sayuri, instead devoting his entire attention to Miyuki. At her brother’s response, Miyuki revealed an ecstatic smile.

“I understand, though I wonder if there’s something you had in mind. So long as it’s Onii-sama’s wish, Miyuki is willing to do anything.”

“Hey, don’t get too worked up.”

Tatsuya lightly poked her forehead before Miyuki shrugged her head down and lightly sprang up to the second floor.



“So, what may I do for you today?”

Once Miyuki’s figure disappeared, Tatsuya reopened the conversation with Sayuri, who seemed stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Afterwards, he stepped quickly into the living room and took a seat on a nearby sofa, and once again called out to the hesitant Sayuri.

“Could we get a move on, since I would like to finish before my sister returns.”

Sayuri creased her brows at these curt words, but she still took a seat opposite Tatsuya.

“Looks like you two still aren’t very welcoming towards me.”

As if realizing that further acting was pointless, Sayuri’s attitude abruptly changed when she sat down.

Completely heedless of Tatsuya’s gaze, she set one leg over another and leaned back on the sofa.

Her casual clothes devoid of any makeup was likely her researcher’s calling showing through, so Tatsuya didn’t have to worry about where to leave his eyes. Of course, even if Sayuri was wearing a tight miniskirt, Tatsuya likely wouldn’t bat an eyelid.

“Miyuki may think that way. After all, it’s only natural for her to be somewhat resentful if her father remarried less than half a year after her mother died. Even though she may act like an adult, she’s really just a 15 year old young girl.”

“……And you?”

“I am incapable of such an emotional reaction. That was the way I was forged.”

“……Well, forget it, regardless of whether that’s true or not, that’s no longer in my hands. Even so, if we were to talk about that, I hope that you can seriously listen to him, since it was only half a year for you two, but a whole 16 years for me.”

Despite her youthful appearance, she was actually the same age as their father. Tatsuya was contemplating these rude concepts like the public enemy of women.

She, Shiba Sayuri, was originally known as Furuha Sayuri and was Shiba Tatsurou’s lover before his marriage with Yotsuba Miya. Rumor had it that the Yotsuba interposed to seize a prized genetic advantage and forcibly cut them apart. Tatsuya could read between the lines of her hatred even if she didn’t verbalize them.

Still, that was an issue between her and their birth parents and was unrelated to the siblings. Since she had maintained an affair with their father while Miya was still alive, she would receive no pity from him.

“So, what’s the occasion that brought you all the way out here?”

Sayuri originally intended to naturally drift into the main subject, so Tatsuya’s direct inquiry caught her off guard and finally shook off the unnatural vibes around their conversation.

“……Then, let’s cut right to the chase. The company labs require your assistance. If possible, we hope you will drop out from high school.”

“Impossible. During Miyuki’s enrollment at First High, I am unable to fulfill my mission as a guardian if I am not a student at First High.”

A ridiculous demand warranted a flat refusal from Tatsuya.

“Even if you’re not a student, other guardians could be made available.”

“There is a shortage of Magicians in every field. Even the Yotsuba Family would be hard pressed to replace a guardian on such short notice.”

“In other words, you are the finest candidate?”

“When only restricted to Miyuki’s protection, that is indeed the case.”

This was a conversation that had occurred multiple times in the past.

Whew, Sayuri heaved a great sigh that didn’t seem theatrical.

“……I doubt any company has enough surplus to allow someone as talented as you, to simply play around.”

“Play around? I do believe I have made powerful contributions to the company as well. A few days ago, the company received an order from the USNA Navy for a large quantity of Flying-Type devices, which boosted the quarterly profits by 20% compared to last quarter.”

At Tatsuya’s combative words, Sayuri couldn’t help but reveal a regretful expression.

That was because she had no rebuttal for Tatsuya’s words.

It was public knowledge that FLT originally wasn’t a manufacturer for CAD products, but a provider for spare parts used for Magic Engineering. Their ascent to the pinnacle of CAD development and production around the globe was largely in thanks to the Silver Series and Tatsuya by extension. With the introduction of Flying-Type Devices, FLT had become the innovator that pioneered the next paradigm shift in the world of Specialized CADs. For Sayuri, who originally entered the company as a researcher and was elevated to management despite having no major accomplishments to her name, this was a towering feat that rendered jealousy meaningless.

Still, those were Sayuri’s personal feelings on the matter. As she replied with an “Ah, is that so,” she also brought up the reason why she couldn’t leave just yet.

“……At the very least, can you help analyze this item for me?”

Sayuri pulled out a large jewel box from her bag and carefully opened the lid.

There was a half-translucent crimson crystal in the middle.

“……A relic from the Magatama class.”

From the perspective of Magic Researchers, “relics” were OOParts that contained a magical nature that had unidentifiable artificial components, yet formed naturally under highly challenging conditions. For example, “Antinite” that contained “Cast Jamming” could be classified as a type of relic.

Also, true relics — such as a Magatama — like this one usually never fell into the hands of a researcher.

“Where was this unearthed?”

“I do not know.”

“I see, this came from the JSDF.”

Given its status as the preeminent domestic manufacturer, FLT received many contracts from the military.

“In terms of analysis, don’t tell me you’re asking for something preposterous like duplicating this Magatama, are you?”

Seeing Sayuri’s stiff expression, Tatsuya could only sigh.

“Who came up with such a reckless decision? Don’t you have any idea how ridiculous it is to attempt to synthesize relics with modern science and technology?”

OOParts is short for “Out Of Place Artifacts”. Essentially, these were “items that did not belong in this time” and were “objects that exceeded the level of science from when it was unearthed” and were simply unable to be developed with technology at the time.

However, precisely because this was something that surpassed modern science, the greatly exaggerated term “relic” was used.

“……The JSDF demanded that we accept the task. Refusal was not an option.”

Not like management’s decision was impossible to comprehend. Not just FLT, corporations in the magic industry by nature served in the public sector and could be broadly painted as a war industry.





Only individuals with practical magic skills would purchase products of magic engineering like CADs, but Magicians held a much smaller share of the market than other industries.

Given the scarcity of Magicians, this was only to be expected.

Currently, the number of people in magic related fields or students studying magic at the high school and collegiate level totaled roughly 30,000 people.

In other words, even if every single one of them purchased a new CAD every year, the total turnover rate would still be 30,000. In reality, the duration time tended to be on the longer side since it was common practice for a Magician to own five or six CADs. Regardless, it didn’t change the fact that the market remained quite narrow.

Also, based on the national policy of promoting magic, magic support devices needed to be sold at a low price. In practice, CAD prices were limited to a level well within the purchasing power of a normal household so they could purchase one for their child that was entering high school as a celebratory present. This sort of independent industry was hard to develop scale and design.

Thus, the nation heavily subsidized the magic industry.

For example, the nation subsidized 90% of CAD sales.

The products sold at the public level were 10% of the price used in exchanges between companies.

In addition, using research grants as an excuse, the nation paid large sums to private corporations each year for research.

Even the largest corporations in the field like Maximilian and Rozen were unable to deny their respective governments. That was the fate of magic industries.

“However, the JSDF should be aware of the meaning behind the relic label. So long as the item has been identified as a relic, they should know that artificial synthesis is no longer possible, so why make this ludicrous demand?”

There was a pregnant pause before Sayuri finally opened her mouth to respond.

“Recently, research has discovered that Magatama possesses the ability to store Magic Sequences.”

Despite the hesitant answer, this was enough to bring a swift change to Tatsuya’s expression.

“Has this been proven to be a fact?”

Suppressing the burning desire in his voice was the limit of Tatsuya’s acting capabilities. Fortunately, Sayuri seemed to miss Tatsuya’s profound interest in relics.

“It’s still in the theoretical phase. Still, the military’s movements have already produced fairly reliable observation data.”

Tatsuya nodded gravely.

“If this is true, then there’s no way the military would leave that alone, which is completely within reason.”

Storage capacity for Magic Sequences was not restricted to only Tatsuya’s goal. If Magic Sequence storage can be spread to the public level, autonomous and self-sustaining magic devices would no longer be a pipe dream. Even troops without Magicians could equip magic weapons. Since Magatamas had the power to store Magic Sequences, successful mass replication would provide a massive supply of magic weaponry.

“But given FLT’s recent gains, there shouldn’t be a need to take the road less traveled.”

Given the project’s importance, once accepting this task, a simple “cannot be done” would not suffice.

“The die has been cast.”

“Even without any chance for success?”

Considering that the key to relic replication remained unknown, this was a colossal risk.

“We have a small chance. By using your magic, analysis is still possible.”

Tatsuya couldn’t help but laugh at Sayuri finally laying all her cards on the table. In the end, she wasn’t here for his brain, but his unique ability.

Just as she always had.

“Even using my power does not guarantee successful replication. ……If you insist, then please send the specimen to the R&D Third Division. I drop by there on a regular basis.”

In reality, this didn’t really affect Tatsuya either way. While it was true that Tatsuya required additional insight on how to preserve Magic Sequences, his goal was only limited to grasping the methodology behind this. Magatama replication was only secondary, so he didn’t want to overly burden the researchers in the office. The bottom line was that scheduling was difficult to come by on their part, so it’s not like they could do whatever they pleased.

“…………”

However, this was not a proposal that Sayuri could stomach. Her position demanded that she take into account the departmental rivalries within FLT. The R&D Third Division simply couldn’t win additional fame and recognition. Also, an infinitely more important and preposterous reason was that neither her nor her husband could afford to allow “Taurus Silver”, Tatsuya himself, any more speaking power. Surely the other labs could surpass Tatsuya’s achievements, right? Given Tatsuya’s large following — to the point that a decisive majority of the Third Division sided with him, maybe their accomplishments would be put on his tab as well. (That was Sayuri’s private suspicion.)

Unable to accept Tatsuya’s proposal, Sayuri clenched her teeth.

“Or, would you prefer to leave the specimen here?”

Tatsuya’s words provided a glimmer of hope for the conflicted Sayuri and became the impetus she seized upon to escape this quandary.

“There’s no need!”

Nonetheless, rather than choosing to compromise, she chose to break off entirely. For her, under no condition would she allow the relic replication to occur away from the office — away from her ability to claim all credit for the accomplishment. Leaving the specimen behind was a ridiculous notion that was synonymous to allowing Tatsuya to pluck this prize from her hands. In actuality, she was the one who originally made the outrageous request to challenge something that “had no successful precedent”, but the present Sayuri had lost all objectivity.

Her ire fully roused, Sayuri rose from her seat.

“I understand now. Seeking your assistance was a mistake in the first place!”

Placing the jewel box back into her bag, Sayuri departed in a huff.

As Sayuri swiftly walked down the hall, Tatsuya was literally right on her heels. By the time she reached the threshold and was putting on her shoes, Tatsuya adopted a tone typically reserved for customer service.

“Since you are carrying valuables, would you like me to accompany you to the station?”

“No need, I’ll drive.”

“As you wish. Do be careful.”

Tatsuya was not displeased by his stepmother’s barb and courteously bowed.



“Miyuki.”

Tatsuya called out to her from the threshold. Wearing a sleeveless mini-dress, Miyuki timidly descended from the stairs.

Her pearly arms revealed a light pink that ran to her shoulders, a product of her own embarrassment at her attire rather than caused by cosmetics.

“Onii-sama, well…… I sincerely apologize for my childish behavior.”

Despite her personal avowal of her childish behavior, in reality this was more like some sort of display of close affection. Naturally, Miyuki was ignorant of this point as she stood there with her skin bared before Tatsuya’s eyes. No matter what she said, she surely must have put considerable thought into this charming display.

Tatsuya gently stroked his sister’s face though she didn’t dare to match his gaze before his fingertips dipped south towards the chin. Suddenly, his index finger swiftly tilted her face upwards.

This simple action caused Miyuki’s enchantingly white skin to flush completely red from her shoulders to her bosom. Her silky long hair gently swayed as her eyes were filled with a dazzling luminescence for an altogether irresistible package.

“Uh, this……”

Their posture seemed to lead up to a kiss, forcing Miyuki to bashfully avert her eyes.

Yet Tatsuya’s fingers once more stretched towards her face.

Mesmerized, Miyuki closed her eyes.

And then,

“—Ah!?”

A muffled cry of pain rang out for a short duration.

“W-What was that for?”

“Punishment.”

Seeing his sister blush and fall back a step (a perfectly natural response to someone suddenly pinching her nose), Tatsuya smiled as he replied.

“Oh…… Onii-sama is a meanie.”

Miyuki sulkily pouted and turned her face aside while maintaining her charming posture. At this, Tatsuya’s expression softened as he continued to smile.

“I’m stepping out for a bit. Make sure to lock the doors until I return.”

“Onii-sama?”

At her brother’s mysterious instructions to watch the house, Miyuki’s expression tightened as she inquired to the reason.

“I’m going to pursue a certain woman who lacks a sense of danger.”

Tatsuya picked up the uniform coat he just took off as Miyuki frowned in displeasure.

“……Exactly how much trouble is that person planning on putting Onii-sama through.”

“Unfortunately, I can’t just leave her to her own devices. Sayuri is holding a relic that may hold the key to Magic Sequence storage.”

Tatsuya removed his tie and handed it to Miyuki as he elaborated on the real motive behind his “pursuit”.

Miyuki seemed to comprehend this somewhat but still crinkled her brows afterwards.

“If that’s the case then there’s nothing for it. Please be careful, Onii-sama.”

Miyuki recalled their conversation after school in the reference room. She would not use her dislike of her father’s lover to bar her brother’s decisions. She did not say “don’t go”, nor did she say “there’s no need to go”, but merely removed Tatsuya’s heavy coat from the hanger in silence.

After throwing on the coat with Miyuki’s assistance, Tatsuya removed a pair of gloves and a helmet from the storage compartment in the threshold and pulled on a pair of riding boots. Tatsuya nodded to Miyuki, who had put her hands side by side in front of herself and bowed deeply to send him off, and said, “I’m off.”




In the speeding vehicle that was automatically directing itself, Sayuri felt an exhaustive pressure pound down on her like twice the weight of gravity.

If she had to say something, it would be a regretful “I still did it……”

After reaching the managerial level, she thought that she had already become accustomed to wheeling and dealing. However, she still heaved a depressed sigh at her headstrong and impulsive behavior.

In principle, the young man was by all rights her son, but every time she was before him she found it hard to maintain her composure.

She was perfectly well aware of the reason behind this.

Because he was the son of her rival.

Paired with an engineer’s ability and achievements.

Complete with unreadable eyes and unfathomable emotions.

Under his eyes, she wasn’t seen as a human being, but simply a specimen under a microscope and relegated to the status of an item.

Just the way he viewed his own role as a tool, but Sayuri was unaware of that.

What she did know was that this contract demanded his cooperation, but her own impatience had made this significantly more difficult. Silently, she redirected her gaze out the window and heaved a heavy sigh.

As she raised her eyes, she noticed that traffic had strangely decreased.

She hadn’t seen any cars coming from the opposite direction since a while back,

And even though this was a residential sector, the hour wasn’t too late yet.

Her inner frustration was submerged by a trace of unease.

She called up the screen for traffic information. The display informed her that other cars had been rerouted along a different path to avoid a stalled vehicle on the road.

Which was a legitimate reason in its own right, letting Sayuri let out a breath of relief.



Chasing Sayuri’s vehicle through traffic on a large electric motorcycle, Tatsuya also noticed the drop in traffic.

The message he received through the headset in his helmet was the same information Sayuri saw on her display.

Nevertheless, Tatsuya did not find any benign news within.

The information that cars were rerouted due to a stalled vehicle wasn’t suspicious in its own right.

Tatsuya had seen first hand exactly how difficult it was to infiltrate the traffic control system when he saw Sanada and Fujibayashi hacking into the system on the scene.

Still, Tatsuya wasn’t optimistic enough to believe every single car was diverted from the road that led from Tatsuya’s house to the station. That sort of thing only happened when multiple cars were stalled on the road.

It wasn’t particularly difficult to identify vehicle locations within the control system.

Especially since commuter vehicles available for public transportation continuously broadcast signals to prevent thieves from using them as escape tools.

Likewise, identifying the signal wasn’t any sort of classified secret.

Since he left the house, Tatsuya was already homing in on Sayuri’s vehicle.

Finally catching sight of his stepmother’s car, he also discovered another manually operated vehicle independent of traffic control that was tailing her.



A shrill alarm sounded from the vehicle’s display.

The display informed her that a manually operated vehicle was closing in.

Yet, Sayuri wasn’t overly concerned.

Even in this age, there still existed people who took pleasure in driving themselves.

As an engineer, she was aware that drivers could modify their cars to be independent of the traffic control system’s influence.

Thus, she paid little heed to the car closing in from behind.

As such, Sayuri leaned back into her seat and switched off the piercing alarm.



Seeing the black manually operated car pick up speed, Tatsuya stepped on the gas as well. In terms of acceleration, Tatsuya’s motorcycle had the edge.

Still, based on proximity and respective speed, the black manually operated car would reach Sayuri’s vehicle first.

In reaction to the manually operated car that suddenly closed in instead of passing by, Sayuri’s car activated its collision avoidance system.

Near her car that came to an emergency stop, two men descended from the manually operated car.

This was an overly brazen action along the streets with wireless surveillance systems. However, given the situation, the suspects were probably illegal aliens, since normal citizens and immigrants would immediately be identified from their images.

Tatsuya raised the lights to the max and pointed them at the two men trying to break open the car door.

Descending from the motorcycle with the lights still on, Tatsuya rushed towards the men.

Tatsuya pulled out the CAD in his chest pocket with his right hand while the men covered their faces to avert the light. A second later, one man used a pistol while the other sent his fists flying towards Tatsuya.

Under the light from the motorcycle, the man’s fist wore a bronze ring that glimmered lightly on one finger.

From the ring, a shrill psionic noise could be heard.

This was magic interference waves known as “Cast Jamming” coming from the “Antinite”.

One of them focused on nullifying enemy magic while the other used the gun to finish off the enemy.

Of course, if their opponent was any run of the mill Magician.

The muzzle was aimed at Tatsuya. The target was the heart, at a range where evasion was altogether impossible, and a clear killing intent could be felt.

Yet the man failed to squeeze the trigger.

Before he could do so, Tatsuya already hit the trigger on his CAD.

The pistol collapsed into pieces in the man’s hands.

One of the men, or maybe even both of them, started yelling in excitement, but given the distance, he wasn’t sure what they were saying. He could only hear the term “Cast Jamming”, which likely signified their surprise that “Cast Jamming” had no effect, or maybe they were expressing their astonishment that the pistol was shattered despite the presence of magic interference waves.

Still, regardless of how it was, that was no longer Tatsuya’s concern. Even if he was hindered in an unexpected way, his actions would not change. Tatsuya once more pulled the trigger.

The man who once held the gun let out a cry of pain and fell to the ground. He pressed his thigh and began rolling on the ground.

Next, the man with the ring pressed his shoulder. He couldn’t contain his moans of pain and doubled over as he broke out into a cold sweat before losing consciousness. Since he was pierced by a force resembling tiny needles that annihilated skin, flesh, blood vessels, nerves, and bones, the sudden pain must have overcome his ability to stay conscious.

Decomposition Magic — Mist Dispersion could decompose any human body part.

So where on the human body would a piercing attack generate enough shock to surpass a man’s consciousness?

Where must the attack land to cut off feeling from the four limbs?

Indifferent to whether it was his own flesh or that of others, Tatsuya was extremely knowledgeable on the matter.

He slipped around the two men on the ground and approached the black, manually operated vehicle.

Tatsuya kept his CAD aimed at the car, but didn’t pull the trigger.

Hydrogen fueled cars contained the fuel in compressed states, so carelessly attacking would trigger a gigantic explosion. Of course, normally there are protocols to avoid ignition, but it was a fact that some chose to remove the safety features to create suicide attacks.

If Miyuki was present then there was no need to worry about an explosion, but unfortunately she was minding the house. The right side of the road was covered by a wide expanse of the river, but the left side was filled with residential buildings. Taking the nearby households into account, Tatsuya judged that he couldn’t force the issue.

Strictly speaking, this decision was overly negligent.

Suddenly, killing intent mushroomed forth above him from the right.

Tatsuya took evasive action on reflex.

There wasn’t even a hint of hesitation in his motion.

Even so, he could not avoid the bullet that flew at supersonic speed.

He felt a burning pain in his breast,

Where the bullet had pierced through his left breast.

The impact from the bullet caused his body to fly through the air.

The enemy’s sniping attack was incredibly accurate.

Even if he avoided a fatal attack, the blow still pierced his lung.

Given how late he heard the gunshot, the attack must have been made from an extreme distance. If Tatsuya hadn’t taken evasive action, the bullet would have pierced his heart.

Conservatively speaking, this was an incredibly skilled sniper.

Tatsuya used the inertia from the falling motion to roll and take cover behind Sayuri’s car.

The wound from the attack had already healed itself. Normally, even fatal injuries would disappear in a flash so long as his magic was active.

Still, that did not mean he could not feel pain.

The extreme pain from the impact of the bullet as well as the bullet leaving his body still threw Tatsuya into a cold sweat.

However, this was not the time to focus on something like that.

Tatsuya needed to pinpoint his attacker’s position.

Given the direction and angle of the attack as well as the placement of the surrounding buildings that could serve as obstacles, the sniper’s location was probably one of the industrial buildings from across the river.

Roughly 1000 meters from his current position.

Taking into consideration that the bullet could easily penetrate the human body and open such a tiny hole, the weapon was probably using sabot rounds.

The car’s exterior was made of synthetic wood, so this wasn’t going to last very long as a cover.

The trickier part came from the fact that the sniper wasn’t using magic.

No matter what sort of magic was used, there would be a trace of magic left behind that Tatsuya could use to swiftly ascertain his opponent’s location.

However, if his opponent was strictly sticking to shooting, this distance made it much harder for him to rely on Elemental Sight.

The two men who had collapsed on the ground lightly floated in the air.

The car door on the black vehicle opened and rudely sucked their bodies inside.

It was a simple act to nullify the Move-Type Magic that was recovering the two men, but right now removing the sniper’s threat was higher priority.

He re-examined the data from the bullet that went through his body.

Tatsuya ran data analysis again and went over the bullet data again.

Bodily fluids.

Physical resistance.

Effects from the wind.

Gravity.

Air compression at the time of the shot.

The variables from the bullet were compressed into a single message and returned to Tatsuya.

He identified the target’s information at the time of attack.

Tatsuya turned back the clock and read the bullet’s trajectory, the sniper’s information and the very memory of the “world”.

From present into the past.

Then,

From past into present.

Using the sniper’s firing point as the origin, he searched the myriad, transient data within the “world” of the information dimension for the desired target.

Within his mind, Tatsuya locked in on the sniper’s Eidos — separating that particular one from the masses the same way he always did.

He also knew that his opponent was aiming here and preparing to fire again.

The second shot hadn’t arrived because the sniper was reloading and changing the armor penetration rounds used earlier to rounds that could penetrate objects that the enemy was taking cover behind, hence the huge delay.

Tatsuya saw through this because he held every scrap of data about this sniper in the palm of his hand.

He had to say he was quite fortunate.

As he thought this, Tatsuya activated the magic to completely decompose the human body.




Ten minutes after the black car fled, Tatsuya judged that there was no further danger and stood up from behind the car.

Peeking into the car’s interior, he found Sayuri had already fainted. Since the car hadn’t activated after all this time, which was perfectly predictable, there was no need for concern.

Her body was surrounded by air bags on all sides, which served as a buffer all around her. This was an excellent example of the safety features kicking in to prevent the driver’s body from suffering physical injury, as this arrangement could protect them from any type of shock.

In that case, she likely fainted due to the mental shock from this event.

At any rate, she was someone connected to the Yotsuba Family, so she should be able to endure some degree of incidents. Yet her current predicament looked just like an average person, right? Tatsuya couldn’t help but ruminate on this.

Once the reusable air bags were tucked away, the automatic vehicle restarted itself.

Covering the slowly moving vehicle from behind, Tatsuya followed on his motorcycle.



By the time they reached the station, Sayuri had already regained consciousness. Her face was a little pale, but she displayed no sign of panic. Of course, Tatsuya was riding a motorcycle behind her during the entire trip, so he had no idea what expression was on her face anyway. After seeing her to the station, Sayuri forced Tatsuya to accept the box that contained the Magatama. Tatsuya felt that Sayuri’s stubborn and relentless appearance exemplified her personality perfectly.

After Sayuri left, Tatsuya headed directly for the phone after returning home. He didn’t use a mobile phone at the station for fear of eavesdroppers.

“Don’t worry about the cameras on route. We’ve already started taking steps.”

“Thank you very much, Major.”

The phone was a direct line to the HQ of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.

As someone who was forced to conceal his identity as one of the primary combatants for the Yotsuba Family within the Ten Master Clans as well as his alias as a Special Lieutenant within the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion, the first order of business for Tatsuya was to ensure that his identity wasn’t exposed by the cameras.

Tatsuya straightened and saluted Kazama’s image on the display.

“Still, I must say that our opponents are behaving quite recklessly. Even though this isn’t the heart of the city, they still fired within the city proper.”

“While I cannot deny that I was overly careless, I must admit that our opponents are quite skilled.”

“They did not use magic, correct?”

“Affirmative.”

Using magic to guide the bullet trajectory undoubtedly would cause a side effect from phenomenon rewriting.

Likewise, using sensory enhancement magic would also reveal their location due to the psion waves.

So long as they used magic, there was no way to hide themselves from Tatsuya.

Kazama was well aware of Tatsuya’s capabilities.

“Yes, during nocturnal conditions and only relying on a scope, they still successfully sniped from nearly a kilometer out.”

Kazama was glancing downwards on the screen, likely looking at the map for the sniper’s location. Tatsuya didn’t completely understand all the nuances regarding sniping; Kazama was much more familiar with the details. Seems like Kazama had found some sort of clue that Tatsuya hadn’t discovered, so even though he hadn’t seen it, he could grasp the details just from Tatsuya’s report.

“There are a limited number of organizations around the world that can dispatch snipers of this quality. We might actually narrow this down rather quickly.”

“Then we’re relying on you.”

Offense was the greatest defense, referring to the concept that by rendering an opponent powerless, one would remove the threat of attack. Since they had already crossed blades once, so long as neither side presses forward, a peaceful solution was not impossible for Tatsuya.

“Hm? Give me a second. ……There’s a new report coming in. We’ve found the car.”

Even though the black car had covered its license plate, this degree of subterfuge could not fool the cameras along the streets set for defensive purposes. So long as they knew when and where the vehicle passed by, unique features could always be identified.

“Since the investigation has already begun, how about letting it start from this end?”

“As you wish.”

At Kazama’s question of verification, Tatsuya immediately nodded in response.

Tatsuya didn’t quibble over details like whether he had to personally capture his escaped opponents.




Owing to the unexpected live action sequence, dinner was slightly later than usual. Still, Miyuki didn’t seem irritated in the slightest as she pranced around in a pink apron with frills as she prepared dinner.

“That apron……?”

“You noticed?”

Hearing the words that slipped from his mouth, Miyuki smiled and turned her head.

The apron Miyuki was wearing was simplistic but adult in its design.

While Tatsuya didn’t know whether this was merely a young lady’s interest, this was the first time he beheld such a fantastically adorable apron.

“This was what you just bought today?”

Before splitting at the station, Miyuki had been pulled into a store catering to young women by Mizuki and Erika.

Tatsuya lounged on the chair as he waited for them, only to have them appear much sooner than expected. When asked what they bought, Erika only said that it was a “secret”, so he didn’t receive a real answer.

“Mizuki said she needed a new apron so I bought one as well. This doesn’t look strange on me, does it?”

Since this was considerably different than her usual fashion, Miyuki watched Tatsuya with worried eyes.

Though it was a simple matter to pass on a compliment, Tatsuya took this opportunity to seriously evaluate his sister’s attire.

Given that the apron’s length was the same as her skirt, it gave off the impression that she was wearing a single dress.

And a mini-skirt apron to boot.

The two straps looped over the shoulders and crossed over the back along with a wide strap tied around the waist with an adorable butterfly knot, complete with a pair of thighs charmingly exposed from the bottom.

Definitely not a getup that can be shown to anyone else, Tatsuya thought.





“It suits you perfectly. In fact, I plan on putting you in a glass display case for personal perusal.”

He realized that his choice of words was slightly odd.

“Onii-sama’s ideas are just a smidgen strange.”

Just listening to her words might sound like she was surprised, but her expression clearly signified that she was trying to hide her embarrassment.

Still, Tatsuya didn’t point this out to Miyuki and merely smiled as he picked up the chopsticks.

After dinner, the two siblings moved from the dinner table to the living room. After setting down a cup of coffee on the table before the sofa Tatsuya was occupying, Miyuki left her cup on the table and sat beside her brother.

“Speaking of which, why did that person visit us today? Did she bring a specimen for Magic Sequence storage?”

After finding a spot to sit, Miyuki sat with her legs closed and placed her hands on top of one another over them as she asked Tatsuya with eyes brimming with curiosity.

“She wanted to find out if Magic Sequence storage was possible.”

Since this was an expected question, Tatsuya already prepared an answer.

“Asking for help, just like before.”

Not like he was relying on half truths to muddle through this.

“Still, this job may be a little more interesting.”

“Has the contract already been accepted?”

Miyuki’s question was just going through the motions, she had already understood through her brother’s earlier words that this task was unavoidable.

“Given that the specimen is sitting right here, seems likely.”

Tatsuya’s gaze shifted to one corner of the table.

The jewel box that Sayuri brought sat there innocuously.

Sayuri forced Tatsuya to hold onto the box in fear of further enemy attack.

“So this is the specimen? Does it possess the power to store Magic Sequences?”

What is it? At the wordless inquiry, Tatsuya opened the box.

“A relic of the Magatama-class.”

Keeping an eye on Miyuki, Tatsuya unveiled the item’s true identity.

Her hands flew to her face as Miyuki stared wide-eyed at Tatsuya.

“Why does that woman have something like this?”

“It was a request from the military. I believe they asked us to replicate this.”

“That’s ridiculous.”

While Miyuki didn’t have the same depth of understanding as Tatsuya regarding how outrageous the replication of relics was, she still understood that this was a preposterous request.

Magic Sequences influenced the Eidos of an object in order to temporarily rewrite the information surrounding the object based on the conditions described within the Magic Sequence — this was magic. For example, an orb that is outwardly red contains an Eidos that “primarily reflected red light” and is “circularly shaped”. If a Magic Sequence containing the condition “primarily reflecting blue light” influenced the Eidos, then the orb would turn blue. Since the Magic Sequence overwrote the Eidos on the object, the conditions within the Magic Sequence would temporarily replace the characteristics of the object. This effect would persist until the conditions from the Magic Sequence fades away.

Though the Magic Sequence occupied a central role in the invocation of magic, using magic to preserve Magic Sequences remained impossible.

Still, if the item itself possessed the ability to replicate the effects from the altered phenomenon and the Magic Sequence could be replicated, then the effects from magic would persist ad infinitum. In other words, copying the altered phenomenon and the Magic Sequence would become possible.

Which would preserve the characteristics of the Magic Sequence as well as the characteristics of the magical effects.

Logically speaking, if Magic Sequences that changed the temperature could be preserved, then high temperatures measuring in the hundreds of degrees or cold temperatures that were dozens of degrees below zero could be achieved without any input. Likewise, replication of Speed Magic that was preserved could create actual perpetual motion machines.

“Just possessing the ability to store Magic Sequences alone is insufficient to replace Magicians, since the Magic Sequences stored within these devices can only be activated through magic. While I have little stake in replicating the Magatama itself, if this item is truly able to store Magic Sequences, then understanding that process becomes absolutely integral.”

“If it’s Onii-sama, then anything is possible.”

At some point, Miyuki scooted over until she was directly next to Tatsuya and laid her head against Tatsuya’s shoulder. She gently reassured Tatsuya, who sat there with a chilly expression on his face as he spoke.



Miyuki’s policy demanded that she did everything within her power to cover all the household chores that pertained to Tatsuya without leaving them to machinery, but even she wasn’t such a stickler that she washed the dishes herself.

She was still a student, with her own pile of mandatory assignments, so some level of compromise was unavoidable.

The plates and utensils from dinner were left to the HAR to dispose of as Miyuki began her homework.

Despite being known as a magic high school, all other subjects besides magic were not mandatory.

There were no regular tests, but daily homework was highly emphasized.

Today, her homework assignment was mathematics. Strictly speaking, this was not one of her strong suits.

Stuck on a question that bedeviled her from the beginning, Miyuki allowed her attention to drift from the screen before her.

This was the age where the man-machine interface could easily process these problems, so no one save for mathematical researchers would actually work out problems by themselves. Yet, mathematical logic powerfully aided the development and formation of new magic, hence her brother had stringent instructions regarding this subject, and so cutting corners was not an option.

Miyuki heaved a bored “Whew”.

At times like these, she envied her omnipotent brother.

Maybe I should ask Onii-sama to teach me, she idly thought before frantically shaking her head furiously.

Right now, Tatsuya was probably deep into analyzing that relic.

Her very presence alone bound Tatsuya’s freedom, so she definitely couldn’t bother him anymore, Miyuki thought.

The sole reason Tatsuya entered First High was because Miyuki enrolled in First High, at least this was how Miyuki interpreted the situation.

A diploma from a magic high school was a prerequisite for attending the National Magic University, but there were always exceptions; especially, talented individuals who might have discovered a “Cardinal Code” would immediately qualify for the examination process even without a magic high school diploma. So long as Tatsuya wished to do so, he would immediately obtain that right and simply passing the examination would not trouble him in the slightest.

Miyuki knew that her brother’s goal lay in the graduate level research programs within the magic universities, so the life of a high school student was actually a considerable detour for him.

The reason Tatsuya was forced to do so was because he was Miyuki’s guardian.

The guardians of the Yotsuba Family bore the duty of preserving their primary’s life even at the cost of their own. This title came from the combat slaves that once rescued a young woman from the Yotsuba Family from enemy attack and were responsible for preserving the Yotsuba bloodline.

On the surface, this mission differed little from ordinary bodyguards, but temporarily hired bodyguards were fundamentally different from guardians. While the Yotsuba guardians were not selected from birth, once selected, their term was for life. Though they were the same as bodyguards in that they served for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, guardians did not possess the right to resign from their duties. Since guardians were only relieved when their primary was released from protection, to this day, without exception, Yotsuba guardians had done their duty until the day they died.

Tatsuya possessed a certain degree of freedom by virtue of the fact that he could still protect his primary even away from the house. Magic was not restricted by physical distance or obstacles. There was no telepathic connection between the two, but Tatsuya was able to unconsciously monitor Miyuki’s surroundings through his “Idea Identification Vision”. In other words, it may be more accurate to say that he had cast magic to keep an eye on her.

Nevertheless, even Tatsuya wasn’t able to use magic while sleeping.

Even if distance was no hindrance, their everyday lives needed to synchronize to some degree.

During holidays and long vacations, Miyuki could still match Tatsuya’s activities, but in school Tatsuya had to link with Miyuki, so they had to accommodate the high school schedule. Also, though magic wasn’t affected by physical distance, a closer proximity made it far easier to react to possible danger.

However, in the end, all of these were only true under the condition that Miyuki does not dismiss Tatsuya from his duties as a guardian.

Once Miyuki would dismiss Tatsuya, surely another guardian, likely of the same age and gender, would be dispatched to her. Even if the number of Magicians was limited, Miyuki was still one of the more promising candidates for the next head of the Yotsuba Family.

Of course, Miyuki hoped to retain Tatsuya as her guardian for reasons that went beyond her own stubbornness.

Within the Yotsuba Family, a guardian’s mission held the highest priority.

While serving as Miyuki’s guardian, he wouldn’t be assigned any meaningless tasks. Nor would he receive any dirty jobs.

Even their father and his new wife couldn’t press the issue on the surface.

They could not insist that Tatsuya help them in their work.

Even with all these considerations in mind, she still wished for her brother to attend the same school she did — the bottom line was that she herself was unable to separate herself from that dependence on her brother, something that Miyuki was aware of.

Again, Miyuki heaved a deep sigh.

Her frazzled mind was incapable of deciphering the answer, just as she was unable to solve the homework question before her.

Actually, even if she didn’t need him to guide her through every step, all she needed to do was ask her brother for help. By the time Miyuki thought of this, 30 minutes had already passed.





Chapter 3




The next day after school.

In order to acquire the documents necessary for their presentation, Tatsuya arrived at the library.

In truth, he really wanted to focus on the analysis of the specimen (Magatama-class relic), but neither could he mail it in for the Thesis Competition preparations (assistance).

Despite its name, the library had already been completely digitized, with actual tomes of paper becoming the decisive minority. Furthermore, a significant portion of the materials could be accessed online, so there was no particular need to visit the library, except that the materials required by the thesis team belonged to the restricted archives that could not be removed from it. Searching for a spare seat in the depths of the reading area, Tatsuya accidentally ran into a familiar face.

“Ara, if it isn’t Tatsuya-kun.”

“Saegusa-senpai, are you in the middle of the ‘Fall of Studying’?”

The last time he ran into Mayumi was approximately a week ago, so he could hardly say “long time no see”.

At Tatsuya’s immediate reply, even though Mayumi had expected the question, she still pouted in vexation.

“I say, Tatsuya-kun…… I am a Year 3 student after all.”

“This…… I know.”

Tatsuya was bewildered by this perfectly obvious statement that was delivered gravely.

“The first thing that comes to mind for Year 3 students are college entrance exams, correct? How is it that you never considered I need to prepare for the exams…… Do I look that carefree to you?”

Mayumi’s words only served to confuse Tatsuya even more.

“……Saegusa-senpai, didn’t you receive the recommendation?”

Excellent grades, service as the Student Council President, renowned for her participation and many victories in magic competitions.

If she wasn’t recommended, then who else could qualify for a recommendation.

Still, Mayumi’s answer surpassed Tatsuya’s expectations.

“Ah? Doesn’t Tatsuya-kun know? I declined the recommendation. It is an unwritten tradition for the members of the Student Council to decline the recommendation.”

“……First I’ve heard of this.”

“Every year, each school recommends 10 students to the magic university, that’s how it was decided~. Compared to other schools, our school has a higher percentage of students that take the entrance exams, so in order to more efficiently utilize the recommendation system, that’s how we decided to go about it.”

“In other words, we let the students on the borderline take first priority for recommendations, did I get that right?”

“That may be going a little too far…… But, that’s pretty much it.”

“That’s……”

On some level this made perfect sense, but he still felt that there was something wrong with this system.

Despite these thoughts roaming through Tatsuya’s head, he decided to drop the matter upon seeing Mayumi sitting there without any perplexity on her face.

Seeing Tatsuya hum and haw, Mayumi tilted her head to one side with a “Hm?” before her attention was caught elsewhere.

“Speaking of which, why is Tatsuya-kun here?”

Tatsuya was slightly put out by Mayumi’s surprised tone — at the very least he frequented the library much more often than Mayumi did — however, there was no need to belabor that point.

“I am here to gather materials for the Thesis Competition.”

“Ah, that’s right, you were selected to help Rin-chan.”

(……Help, eh.)

That must be the case from another person’s perspective, Tatsuya thought.

Although this was also a group activity, unlike Monolith Code with the option to put an individual’s talents on full display, there was no way to identify individual contribution in the thesis itself.

It was hardly odd to believe that everyone besides the primary speaker were only assistants.

“……Oh, standing there and talking would bother every one else. Come on in.”

As she said this, Mayumi pointed at the reading booth she just came out of.

“Aren’t you using it?”

Despite the fact that retaking the booth after returning it was against the rules, it’s not like he could just stand outside the door.

Tatsuya nodded without further hesitation.



The reading booth was originally designed for one user and while two people felt a little tight, three people would be completely out of the question. Even if Mayumi belonged on the petite side of her gender, Tatsuya’s physical stature was undoubtedly above average among his Year 1 peers. Despite not being particularly swarthy, his wide shoulders still took up considerable seating space. Hence Tatsuya sat near the end of the seat shoulder to shoulder with Mayumi, who took a seat on the backup stool.

He was alone in a tiny room with a beautiful young lady.

However, even under these conditions, Tatsuya was neither overly excited nor filled with trepidation. Owing to past experiences, he had already learned how to handle Mayumi. (As for her pride as a “beautiful woman”, well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.)

At Tatsuya smoothly operating the terminal despite their close proximity without a care in the world, Mayumi didn’t become anxious or display a disappointed expression. Frankly, she continued their interrupted conversation in a wholly unguarded fashion.

“I know it’s a bit sudden for Tatsuya-kun, but good luck, OK?”

“……True, it was a little sudden.”

Tatsuya was slightly off kilter at Mayumi’s seemingly natural words that came without any premonition, but once he connected these words with their earlier conversation, he was fortunately able to avoid asking “For what?”.

“But that’s not something that Saegusa-senpai would worry about, right?”

He replied carelessly while his eyes were focused on the screen.

“That may be true. Still, this topic is more important to Rin-chan than taking First Place in the Thesis Competition.”

“Now that you mention it, did senpai talk to you about serving as a substitute?”

“That’s definitely not a topic I can handle. Also, I’m not that handy with sustaining magic with complex processes.”

The question and answer provided didn’t entirely match up, but Suzune was likely aware of what areas Mayumi excelled at, hence she removed her name from the replacements roster, Tatsuya explained to himself.

“It’s unfortunate. Rin-chan helped me out quite a bit, but now I can’t give her a hand.”

He was unsure whether she was muttering to herself or towards him. While he thought about reassuring Mayumi, who wore a pained expression on her face, ultimately he chose to silently plug away and keep searching for data.

“So I really hope Tatsuya-kun will try his best, since Tatsuya-kun can definitely provide powerful assistance to Rin-chan.”

“Does Ichihara-senpai have any particular thoughts about this topic?”

Tatsuya asked this question more out of curiosity than because he was motivated by her encouragement.

“On some level, this is the first step to realizing Rin-chan’s dream.”

Tatsuya didn’t dig deeper into Mayumi’s formless words.

Even if Suzune had a dream, surely that had nothing to do with him.

Regardless of Tatsuya’s thoughts on the matter, Mayumi didn’t stop there.

“Raising the social standing for Magicians. She aimed not to change their social standing through political pressure, but through economic necessity. By turning magic into an irreplaceable aspect in the economy, Magicians would be truly free of their fate as humanoid weapons. According to Rin-chan, Sustained Gravity Control-Type Magic Sequence Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor is the key step towards this goal. This thesis is precisely the first step for that purpose.”

Tatsuya couldn’t help but turn his head at this.

Under his widened eyes, even Mayumi shrank back a little.

“Hm, what is it?”

“That’s astounding. I never thought that Ichihara-senpai was contemplating the exact same thing.”

“Eh? Tatsuya-kun too?”

In all honesty, Suzune and Tatsuya couldn’t be credited with the idea of using economic utility to raise Magicians’ social standing. Despite the paltry number of supporters, this notion had already been around for at least twenty years. The only technicality was that there had hitherto been no sign of success.

Currently, the primary usage for Magicians remained strictly military.

With the global situation gradually stabilizing, practical mobilization of weaponry had decreased as well.

Still, innovations for Magicians — and not the magic sort — were still dominated by military purposes in the 90% tier.

At the current progression, all of this had yet to change.

The overwhelming majority of magic for domestic purposes could be replaced by machinery.

Temperature control and physical acceleration couldn’t match the same superb effect from magic, but if restricted to the level for public consumption, then non-magic technology could still be viable. There was no need to use magic.

Nor did advanced automatons need to be replaced by Magicians. Magic was not required for operation or organization.

So far, no result that could only be produced by magic had supplanted the versatility of modern science, so “using economic advantages to liberate Magicians” remained empty words from idealists.

On the other hand, the concept for Sustained Gravity Control-Type Magic Sequence Thermonuclear Fusion Reactors didn’t come from Tatsuya’s group either.

In this regard, research had begun 50 years ago to use magic to actualize thermonuclear fusion reactors.

Nevertheless, this research had been forgotten in this day and age.

After judging that repeatedly activating Gravity Control-type Magic to maintain a thermonuclear fusion reactor rated as one of the “Three Great Puzzles for Gravity Magic”, most developed countries already used solar energy to address their energy problems, so presently there was no sign of energy shortage.

Those who placed their hopes on using Sustained Gravity Control-Type Magic Sequence Thermonuclear Reactors to raise the social standing of Magicians had practically gone extinct in the latter half of the 21st century.

“I can’t believe I found someone who shared such radical beliefs.”

Seeing Tatsuya wear an admiring expression rather than shock, Mayumi stared at him for some unknown reason.

“……Hm, that’s wonderful. So you share the same interests as Rin-chan.”

Not only her eyes, even her tone was irked.

“Ah, no, I hardly think that it’s a question of whether Ichihara-senpai and I share the same interests…… Our methodology is completely different.”

What is she so upset about, Tatsuya thought as he replied in a fashion like someone plucking an excuse out of nowhere.

“But the basic concept is the same, right? Tatsuya-kun, in reality, Rin-chan’s more your type, huh?”

“Ha?”

“Even with such an alluring young lady next to you, yet you show no signs of even trying. Well, Onee-san is sorry that she has such an adolescent figure.”

What was this person talking about? Those were Tatsuya’s unfiltered feelings.

Speaking of which, even if they shared the same topic, it was hardly a guarantee that they were companions and more likely that they were opponents. Despite her petite figure, Mayumi didn’t boast an adolescent physique at all, more like an intriguing figure filled with mature charm.

There were too many misunderstandings that demanded his immediate attention, but Tatsuya was at a loss as to where to begin.

“I have no exhibitionist tendencies. I would never do anything to a woman before all these cameras here.”

Tatsuya was quite befuddled.

The first answer that came to his mind after the cobwebs didn’t appear to fit very well.

“Eh……?”

At Tatsuya’s apparently profound, but actually completely careless words, Mayumi started fidgeting in place and her eyes started drifting around.





“Well, then, what if there weren’t any cameras or people here? Let’s say, for example, if it was just the two of us alone in a hotel room?”

“If that’s senpai’s invitation to dine, then I shall gladly ‘dig in’ without hesitation.”

With a clatter, Mayumi sprang away from her stool, blushing furiously and pressed against the wall to pull as far back as possible from Tatsuya in the narrow room. Seeing this, Tatsuya suddenly realized the double entendre in his words.

Still, saying anything else would just dig himself deeper, so Tatsuya took it as a fortunate sign that he managed to stop there. He turned his gaze from Mayumi and concentrated on gathering the necessary data for the project.

On the other hand, Mayumi, who should have felt threatened by Tatsuya’s response, chose to remain in the reading booth for some mysterious reason.




During the evening three days before the thesis was due, Tatsuya was going over the numbers at his private work station when he noticed that the home server was under attack.

There were simultaneous attacks from multiple channels, signifying that this hacking attempt was not done by an amateur.

This was done by specialists specifically to data mine the construct.

There was a high possibility that this was not by chance, but a specific attack on this household’s IP address.

No matter how many times they were beaten back, they continued pressing forward.

Quite the determined bunch indeed.

Looks like we have to switch to another IP address, Tatsuya groaned to himself as he sighed while activating the tracer.



During lunch break the next day.

Tatsuya stopped by the Counseling Room.

His target was obviously Haruka.

Of course, the subject of this conversation wasn’t something trivial like teenage worries or fancies.

“……Unfortunately, the link was cut in the middle. Hence the source of the attack was not uncovered.”

Haruka did nothing to hide her unwillingness to help — more like intentionally put that on full display — despite the fact that this wasn’t an attitude a counselor should display. Nonetheless, after taking into account that Tatsuya’s business had nothing to do with counseling and their history, this was hardly Haruka’s fault.

“……And then? I’ll say this ahead of time, I’m not capable of tracing them over the web.”

Hearing that highly exasperated voice, Tatsuya almost burst into laughter. Still, doing so would undoubtedly rouse her ire, so he made sure to wipe that off his face.

“Naturally, I’m aware of sensei’s strengths, nor do I plan to venture into such troublesome territory.”

“Then what do you want?”

A wary expression spread across Haruka’s face.

Whenever Tatsuya looked like he was about to cut into a serious conversation, she had to suspect that he had some ulterior motive up his sleeve. That was a lesson she had already learned by now.

“Regarding organizations that have recently been secretly trafficking in magic intel, could you elaborate on anything within your purview?”

Seeing Tatsuya adopt a “friendly” smile with a placating attitude, Haruka furrowed her brows in displeasure.

“……I say, Shiba-kun. You do know I have to maintain confidentiality, correct?”

“Naturally.”

“…………”

Haruka’s mouth pressed into a thin line and stopped.

She probably wanted to say “Brazen little……”, Tatsuya thought.

As to why, he himself thought this way.

That being said, it’s not like that comment stung him.

“……From the end of last month to the first days of this one, several illegal aliens managed to infiltrate Yokohama and the surrounding environs.”

In a tone that one could almost hear her sighing in, Haruka began anew.

Once enthralled by sweet temptation, escaping its grasp became difficult. For people working in the intelligence field, this was one of the rudimentary lessons.

Can’t believe she fell for that…… Haruka’s heart was filled with regret.

“Despite the county police and coast guard combining their efforts, they don’t have much to show for it. At the same time, both ‘Maximilian’ and ‘Rozen’ suffered thefts.”

Maximilian and Rozen were the top of the line in global CAD production. In other words, their goal lay in the production facilities for magic devices.

“Hard to think this is a sheer coincidence.”

“Right now there is no confirmation that this was done by the same group. Shiba-kun, I advise you to avoid submitting the thesis online and bring a hard copy instead.”

Only her last words were spoken with any sincerity.

Haruka diverted her gaze to her desk as Tatsuya sought to verify her intentions.

This was a sign that she didn’t wish to continue the conversation.

Tatsuya knew better than to push onward.



After school at the HQ for the Public Moral Committee, Tatsuya was conveying last night’s events to Isori.

“……So, there was no loss?”

“Nothing really happened.”

Tatsuya raised a hand to stop Isori, who had risen in concern, as he smiled wryly and shook his head.

Isori was someone who could instantly transform into a “neutral, beautiful young lady” simply by changing a set of uniforms, so having him approach unnecessarily was still an uncomfortable experience.

Of course, since these opinions couldn’t be expressed, he had to ensure that he didn’t unconsciously tilt backwards.

“Compared to that, anything happen at your residence, Isori-senpai?”

Isori started before furrowing his brows and lowering his voice.

“You mean that the hacker’s goal was……”

His soft voice oddly contained a hint of feminine charm.

Rumor had it that the man once despaired over the small number of male friends, but apparently that wasn’t because they disliked him and was more likely they kept him at arm’s length for a reason…… Contrary to the words he spoke, these thoughts were running through Tatsuya’s mind.

“Given the hacker’s modus operandi, their target is likely the research files associated with a magic thesis. Based on the timing, we cannot rule out that this is related to the competition itself.”

Actually, based on the time frame, another reason boasted a higher probability, but that information was too sensitive for him to be that open about it.

Also, prudence harmed no one.

Tatsuya’s words caused Isori’s brows to bunch together, displaying an expression that he was considering whether there were any premonitions lying down that path.

“Right now, there aren’t any clues on the table…… Still, I think we should inform Ichihara-senpai about what happened.”

“You’re right.”

Tatsuya originally planned to do just that, so he immediately nodded in assent at Isori’s proposal.

“Kei, sorry for the wait~.”

A delighted voice that ended with a trill interrupted their conversation.

Needless to say, the one who sat beside Isori with a flourish without waiting for a response and latched onto his arm before flirting with him was Kanon.

“Tatsuya-kun, long time no see.”

With a wry smile that said, what am I going to do with her, Mari also arrived and greeted Tatsuya.

While questioning whether 10 days constitutes “long time no see”, after considering that they used to meet every school day up until last month, this did give off the impression that they hadn’t seen each other for some time.

“Indeed. Long time no see.”

Tatsuya rose and gave Mari his seat.

“Oh, thank you.”

Mari didn’t bother to decline and sat with a smile.

As usual, she was still a vibrant, handsome woman, Tatsuya thought as he said “You’re welcome”, and pulled up another chair to sit next to Mari.

“So, Tatsuya-kun, how is Kanon handling her new responsibilities?”

And Mari promptly dropped this bombshell.

Well, the former Chief inquiring on the effectiveness of the acting Chief was still within expectations, but if she and Isori were present, this conversation topic became a little awkward.

“Mari nee-san!?”

Then again, the sight of Kanon panicking swiftly illuminated the reasoning behind that question.

Quite the pleasant upperclassman-underclassman relationship, no?

“Since we don’t run patrols together, I’m not familiar with the particulars, but……”

Given the hilarious potential, Tatsuya decided to put on an act.

“She is very well organized and specializes in throwing out unnecessary junk. At times, she seems overly decisive.”

Tatsuya finished speaking with a perfectly serious expression and a tone with no voice inflections whatsoever, prompting both Mari and Kanon to squirm in their seats. Mari did so because she was well aware of her own deficiencies in organizational skills, while Kanon was reflecting on the numerous times she tossed something that shouldn’t have been thrown away and had been forced to retrieve them.

Tatsuya’s comments weren’t just directed to Kanon since Mari plainly read between the lines of his words, but Isori was hopelessly lost.

Isori directed an outwardly solemn, but actually gentle reminder to Kanon.

“……Despite Shiba-kun’s words, doesn’t Kanon have a lot of things on her plate too? Relying on me is one thing, but everything else has been handed over to Shiba-kun.”

“……So I’m not good at those things. I’m a firm believer in division of labor.”

Her tantrum and flirtatious behavior were a world of difference from her usual — whenever Isori was not around — fiery attitude. Seeing this, both Tatsuya and Mari chuckled wryly.

“OK, we can talk about everything else some other time……”

That’s about enough of that, Tatsuya thought as he turned over a new leaf as he urged Mari to “cut to the chase”.

“OK, let’s leave it at that. Actually, I came to discuss security for the Thesis Competition.”

“Security? Is the Public Moral Committee on duty?”

“Exactly.”

Having students serve as “security” for extracurricular activities was odd to say the least, but Tatsuya seemed to be the only one ill at ease. That was probably because this was the case every year.

“Even though we’re called security, we don’t actually provide guards for the site itself. The Magic Association will dispatch specialists for that purpose.”

Rather than dodging the question, Mari provided an explanation before the question could be asked.

“The topic I want to discuss would be personal bodyguards for the team members as well as guards to watch over the report materials and supplies. After all, the Thesis Competition contains restricted information that ‘may not be publicized to personnel unrelated to the magic universities’. This is public knowledge. Owing to these reasons, participants for the Thesis Competition are often the target of industrial spies.”

Tatsuya was slightly surprised by this oddly appropriate topic. Even though this fell within his projected predictions, he still couldn’t contain his astonishment.

“……Such as breaking into household servers?”

“……No, this is at the high school level after all…… Despite calling them spies, they are only small timers trying to make some money off this event. There’s no precedent for someone hacking in to steal information……”

That makes perfect sense, Tatsuya thought as he heard Mari’s answer.

In modern age, network intrusion was a serious felony. Stealing information through the network warranted heavier punishment than normal theft and belonged in the same category as homicide. At the same time, network protection had also improved substantially, making this an unprofitable venture for professional criminals.

Then the hackers from last night were indeed from…… As Tatsuya drifted into his thoughts, Mari’s words picked up steam.

“Instead, we should say that security is required to prevent theft and burglary. Four years ago, there was a precedent where one of the speakers was attacked en route. Following that, each school arranged for guards to accompany key personnel in the weeks approaching the event.”

Luckily, Tatsuya was able to focus in time before the conversation concluded.

“Of course, our school also follows this practice every year. The guards are selected from the Public Moral Committee and the Club Activities Group, though each principal will pick from this group.”

“I will be responsible for Kei.”

Of course! Kanon interrupted.

Quite the amusing reaction, Tatsuya thought, but this time he didn’t break into a wry smile or break into laughter.

“……Well, looks like Isori has no complaints, so let’s go with that. Of course, that includes an assistant…… Kanon, don’t kick aside your teammates, OK?”

“Hey! No one is going to do something like that. I’m not that childish.”

Seeing that pout and puffed up cheeks, Kanon’s words “not that childish” were a little hard to take at face value, but three warm gazes chose to overlook the words “not that childish”.

“Ichihara decided to take Hattori and Kirihara as her guards.”

“The Club Activities Group Leader himself, eh?”

“I thought Hattori couldn’t even look Ichihara in the eye?”

Mari replied to Tatsuya’s blandly voiced question with a mischievous smirk.

“Next…… Is what are we going to do with you.”

“There’s no need.”

Mari maintained her devilish smirk as she spoke, to which Tatsuya replied immediately in the negative.

“Meh, that’s also true.”

Likewise, Mari didn’t have any intention of convincing Tatsuya otherwise.

“There’s no point in surrounding you with guards, since there’s a higher chance of them getting in the way. I understand, so I’ll pass that along to Hattori.”

At Mari’s response, Tatsuya finally asked a question.

“Speaking of which, why is Watanabe-senpai here?”

There was no particular reason behind this question. Tatsuya was curious as to why the current Chief Kanon wasn’t coordinating this, but the previous Chief Mari was coordinating between the Public Moral Committee and Club Activities Group.

“……Uh, there’s no real reason……”

At Mari’s vague mumbling, Tatsuya face colored in ire.

He clearly received the signal at how much they were overly protected as Mari twisted to one side in embarrassment.




The products in First High’s student store had far surpassed the level of “high school student stores”.

Still, each of the nine magic high schools was like this, so as to provide materials related to magic studies not sold in normal stores to reduce student stress and raise necessary supplies to meet the rising demand.

In the end, this was still a small student store on campus, so if there was an item that simply couldn’t be obtained on campus, then students still had to go off campus to obtain them.

In this area, all nine magic high schools were also the same, as stores had sprouted along the nearby streets leading to the high schools to provide materials, notebooks, books, and miscellaneous items that could not be purchased in the student store.

As mentioned above, the stores lined along the streets near First High had a plethora of selections available.

Tatsuya and Isori were purchasing slides for the 3-D projector in one of the shops in front of the station. The deadline for the project was tomorrow, so they couldn’t afford to wait for the student store to get new merchandise.

“Plainly, we would be fine without the senpais accompanying us……”

The reason that Tatsuya still said this halfway through the trip was partially because he was apologetic that the upperclassmen had to tag along the entire time, and partially to suppress Kanon, who latched onto her lover heedless of other people watching them.

Clearly, the grass was greener on the other side, while the reverse was also true. Possibly, the bystanders had a more objective view of the situation.

Since Kanon was the only one flirting whereas Isori seemed entirely at a loss what to do, the pair was not completely hopeless yet.

Speaking of which, Miyuki was still on campus. Kanon had a legitimate reason in serving as Isori’s protection, but even if this was a temporary jaunt, Miyuki didn’t have the luxury of abandoning her responsibilities in the Student Council and following her brother. Currently, precisely because she was well aware that Kanon was with them, she was hammering away at the terminal with great irritation.

“No, leaving everything to Shiba-kun would be bad form. Also, I want to verify the products as well.”

Basically, the overly diligent Isori’s reply was only to be expected.

At this point, Tatsuya didn’t think he could just send the two of them packing either. His earlier comment was both a mild complaint and also an attempt to clear out the slightly feminine laughter that needled the ears. He could relax after making the conscious decision to block all this out, which was one area that Tatsuya excelled in.

Afterwards, using an incredibly slow pace that wasted another 5 minutes, they finally arrived at the shop.

Tatsuya swiftly made all the necessary purchases and let Isori know that “I’m waiting outside”, before stepping out of the store.

Finally able to catch some peace and quiet, Tatsuya noticed that someone was spying on him.

There was no sign that someone was shadowing him. Even if he had been harassed by sweet whispers expected from a high school couple, he didn’t lower his guard.

However, even if they weren’t Tatsuya, anyone would notice such an obvious gaze.

This store was along the shortest route from the school to the station and was almost on the station’s doorstep. If someone was waiting in ambush at the front of the station, it would be a simple task to identify students on their way home, so he estimated that they must have been camping here since much earlier. Although their figure remained hidden, their rampant hostility signified that they were up to some deviltry. On the other hand, in terms of sheer wariness, this level was altogether childish compared to the sniping attack Tatsuya weathered two days ago.

As he debated over what action to take, Isori and Kanon came out with their purchases.

“Sorry for the wait…… What happened?”

Tatsuya could only sigh in appreciation at Isori’s ability to sense something was off the moment he stepped out of the store and ask him the cause of it.

He wasn’t wearing such an opaque expression.

As evidenced by Kanon tilting her head to one side with a “Huh?” expression on her face.

Isori was an expert on magic utilizing delayed activation conditions, but these observation skills probably coincided more with sensory systematic magic.

“Nothing, we’re being observed, so I was thinking of how to respond.”

There was no need to hide this detail, so Tatsuya directly answered Isori’s question.

Still, he wasn’t able to finish that answer.

“Observed? By spies!?”

Tatsuya remained thinking, because Kanon interjected before he could say “how to respond”.

And very loudly too.

That was like telling their opponent to “bail now” and, as expected, the observation was cut short as whoever was responsible quickly departed.

Yet, Kanon was worthy of being Mari’s chosen successor.

After a simple “where?” to Tatsuya, she immediately sped off in the direction Tatsuya’s eyes pointed towards.

“Kanon, magic!”

“I know! Have faith in me, Kei.”

He reminded her precisely because he didn’t completely believe her, but Isori was half a beat slower than Kanon, so he could only stand there with her emergency replacement, Tatsuya, and helplessly watch her rapidly departing figure.



As well as being in the top tier of Magicians around the world, Kanon was also a member of the cross country club.

She didn’t have the same leg strength as a top flight athlete who didn’t know magic, but she was a match for any ordinary high school student, even the boys as well.

With her skirt flying, Kanon immediately noticed the petite figure fleeing the area from the corner of her eye.

That young girl was wearing the same school uniform she was wearing.

She was surprised by this turnout, but acting was always her stronger suit and Kanon’s philosophy was always decisive action without waffling over the details. Although she didn’t hear any convincing evidence on Tatsuya’s part that this was her culprit, Kanon never let up on her pursuit.

The distance was rapidly shrinking. By the time there were 10 meters between them, the fleeing young girl turned to look.

Revealing a face not covered by a mask nor wearing dark shades to disguise her features.

The young girl didn’t intend to catch Kanon’s eyes, but that was the result forged through chance.

By the time Kanon noticed that the young girl had drawn a small device, the young girl turned towards a new direction and held the device between the two of them.

Not good, Kanon thought.

On reflex, she halted her footsteps and shut her eyes.

Despite raising her hands to protect her face, she knew that this was a futile gesture.

Through the cracks in her arms, a burning, violent flash could be seen through the eyelids.

Several curious bystanders who were watching the two of them screamed in pain.

Kanon closed her left eye that couldn’t be fully protected from the flash and opened her right eye that managed to avoid any damage.

The young girl was fleeing on a scooter.

Kanon extended her right arm to the left wrist.

The bracelet around her wrist began to absorb psions and began spreading the Activation Sequence according to the instructions she was inputting into the CAD.

However, before Kanon could complete the Activation Sequence, psion pellets that materialized suddenly behind her shattered it.

“What are you doing!?”

“Kanon, don’t!”

Both occurred at the exact same time.

As Kanon whirled around and Isori rushed forward, their words overlapped with one another.

Behind Isori, Tatsuya stood there with a handgun-shaped CAD raised.

Isori arrived where Kanon, who stood there stiffly in shock at her lover’s shout, was standing.

While running towards her, Isori had already finished constructing the Magic Sequence.

Towards the fleeing scooter that continued forward, he invoked the Release Systematic Magic “Road Extension”.

The wheels on the scooter, which had just started to egress from the scene, suddenly started skidding.

No matter how hard the engine pushed, there was no way to advance.

Despite the open path before her, she was unable to escape this linear maze.

The secret lay in Coulomb’s Law[1]. By altering the electrons between the tires and road, he had reduced the friction to nearly zero. The mere description of the magic was simple enough, but the calculations necessary to actually realize this Magic Sequence were absolutely terrifying.

At the same time, he used magic to increase the gyroscopic effect to prevent the vehicle from falling over and any early acceleration had been devoured by Coulomb’s Law, so the scooter the young girl was riding was effectively stranded.

There was no way for her to escape.

Isori, Kanon, and Tatsuya all thought this was a foregone conclusion, which was a perfectly natural and expected judgment. From a common sense perspective, there was no way to escape this trap.

But they didn’t know one thing.

This young lady was a complete amateur when it came down to reckless behavior.

Once an amateur was forced into desperate straits, they often decide upon a ridiculous course of action.

If an act of desperation was all she had left, then surely the ending was already written, except desperate measures had a habit of succeeding in desperate times.

The young girl thumbed the button on the end of the left side of the handle that was covered by a plastic lid.

Normal scooters don’t have a button there.

The button was covered by a lid like the ones seen on a fire alarm that could only be used once. This button married the “one use only” function to the “abandon after use” function.

Abruptly, the back of the seat exploded.

The back of the seat went flying, revealing two twin-linked rockets that began spewing flame.

The scooter sprang forward with a kick.

The young girl riding the scooter frantically clung to the handle when her body started tilting backwards.

Speechless, Tatsuya could only watch the rapidly diminishing figure.

She never let go of the handle possibly because some sort of function was built into the glove. So she had planned ahead to this point, Tatsuya thought.

Still, your average person wouldn’t choose to attach rockets propelled by rocket fuel beneath their seat.

The fuel amount could be estimated based on the amount of time the rocket was lit, so if the scooter tipped over and ignited, the ensuing explosion would undoubtedly kill any innocent bystanders nearby.

It was a veritable miracle that the scooter didn’t fall over and kept moving forward after the rockets were ignited.

Usually, sudden acceleration would lead to an abrupt loss of control and the subsequent crash.

If not for the magics that increased gyroscopic force and also reduced tire friction to practically zero, that was the most likely result.

If they had used Kanon’s magic instead of Isori’s magic to stop her, the scooter would definitely have fallen over and caused a tragedy.

“……What was that child thinking……”

“……I think we should say that we’re both pretty lucky……”

It appeared that both his senpais were thinking along the same lines Tatsuya was.




After abandoning the modified scooter, the young girl sucked in great gasps of air as she squirmed into the van prepared by her collaborator ahead of time.

She never imagined that having flames sprout out from a close proximity would be such a terrifying event.

While driving the scooter, she had the impression that her skirt, the back of her shirt and her hair were burning the entire time.

The driver of the van remained silent.

There were no words of comfort for her.

Which was only to be expected.

They weren’t companions. They were merely collaborators.

The young girl tightly hugged her arms.

On top of the seat painted a dull gray by the tinted windows, the young girl sat there motionlessly.

Shortly afterward, her terror gradually faded until only regret gnawed at her heart.

She had been overcome by her flight instinct, but coldly examining the facts told her that this was not necessary.

After all, the only thing she had done was watching that man.

Her guilty conscience stole her ability to think objectively. As she became aware of this, the young girl was consumed with an irresistible fury at her own failings.

She also became aware that she was not suited for this line of work.

She was publicly acknowledged to be the indoor type and she didn’t feel any need to change any of that.

Her dear older sister was also like that.

Her scholarly older sister was her role model, but since she wasn’t as talented as her sister, she chose a path that suited her interest in working with machinery.

So what was she doing with these suspicious individuals, she asked herself.

She immediately reached an answer.

From the depths of her heart.

It was all because she could never forgive that man.

She cared not for the rewards of her labor.

So long as she could see a regretful expression pass over that man’s face, that alone would be sufficient.

The young girl suddenly broke into laughter.

That was because she remembered that she had seized the initiative today.

Even though she didn’t have the luxury to watch the rear view mirror, he must have sat there stunned as he could only watch her successfully get away……

The young girl’s laughter was as dark as it was masochistic, with a trace of obsession tucked within.

With each breath of laughter, the young girl’s heart fractured a little more.

Not like there was anyone on board who was going to stop her.



Inside one of the old buildings sitting in the outskirts of Tokyo, several older display screens were set up in a room within an office that appeared to be an office of commerce on the outside. Several men garbed in different attires stood before these screens and were intently watching the display.

One middle-aged man with a dark cloud over his face gestured at the young girl laughing madly on the screen that linked to the interior of the van and spoke up.

“Is that girl going to be OK?”

The man cared little for her well-being. He was only wondering if the young girl’s idiocy would be traced back to them.

“Mr. Zhou arranged for the driver, so we would be above suspicion even if something did occur.”

“Why exactly are we trusting this young middle man again?”

The young man’s face floated across his mind as another man spoke up in displeasure.

—Not only was he an irritating factor, he was also completely untrustworthy.

That was this man’s undisguised feelings.

“What of the relic?”

To sweep aside the jittery atmosphere, the man changed the topic. One of his subordinates before the monitor displays immediately replied back.

“We have discovered no signs that it has left the FLT office. Current location is unknown.”

“Hm…… Four Leaves, eh? What an irksome name, is it connected to the Yotsuba Family in any way?”

“Yes, but after extensive investigation, no link was discovered. Also, this country likes to use Yotsuba or Yatsuha in their company names.”

“That makes this a little difficult.”

The man’s words were infused with disgust, hatred and irritation, but at the same time, the voice could not hide his fear.

The Yatsuha name was associated with the Four Great Systems and Eight Major Types in modern magic as well as the Garbhako’sa-Dhatu Mandala, so modern corporations delighted in using that name. Still, there was another meaning behind the Yotsuba name. Using the name of the Yotsuba Family from the Ten Master Clans was considered a taboo by individuals affiliated with magic. If Japanese corporations used the Yotsuba name, both intelligence and criminal organizations feared to rouse the Yotsuba Family’s wrath by harming their assets. Since the Yotsuba Family hadn’t declared otherwise, there were many corporations who “pretended” to be affiliated with the Yotsuba Family.

Even though this was but a cheap parlor trick, that did not mean there were no effects. Currently, their side had already expended considerable time and energy to guard against the Yotsuba Family’s detection, a fact that brought a bitter expression to the man’s face when he remembered this.

“Don’t relax the surveillance on Sayuri. Do we have any intel on the family she visited two nights ago?”

At the man’s question, another subordinate spoke up.

“Her husband’s son and daughter from his first marriage reside there.”

“Was it just to placate her stepchildren?”

After adopting a “How boring” expression at his subordinate’s response, the man resumed asking in a businesslike manner.

“What’s their background?”

“Both of them are Year 1 students at the Magic University-affiliated First High.”

However, that answer roused the man’s interest.

“Names?”

“The older brother is called Shiba Tatsuya, the sister is called Shiba Miyuki.”

“Shiba Tatsuya?”

Just as the man was searching his memory for this familiar name, the subordinate monitoring the van spoke up.

“He is the target of our collaborator’s vendetta.”

“I see, magic university affiliated high school? ……What a coincidence.”

After considering this for a few seconds, the man couldn’t help but break into a smirk as he gave new orders.

“Add the Magic University-affiliated First High to the list of observation targets. If necessary, pull men from other projects. Also, provide additional reinforcements for that girl and tell her the easiest path to vengeance lays through leaking critical information. And give that child a weapon as well.”

The orders were fired off one at a time.

“Captain Lu!”

“Yes, sir!”

“You are in command. Any meddlesome interlopers are to immediately be disposed of!”

After giving his last orders to a bulky youth, the man departed from the room.





Chapter 4




Today was the deadline to turn in the thesis, presentation draft, and materials to the school.

Suzune, Isori, and Tatsuya had no interest in trying to slapdash the job the day before the deadline, so they had produced the data disc the day before.

During the lunch break, they gathered to go over the final checklist that was not directed towards the contents within, but examining the context and manner of presentation of the major points. After passing their inspection, they accepted Haruka’s suggestion and Suzune personally handed the data disc to Tsudzura.

“Does Ono-sensei’s advice to not turn in the thesis online have anything to do with yesterday’s incident?”

After finishing the portion he was responsible for, Isori asked in a blank manner.

“Possibly.”

After finishing his task (even the burden allotted to a Year 1 student was by no means light), Tatsuya replied in a whisper to avoid distracting Suzune.

“It would be far simpler to hack from on campus to get a glimpse of the network.”

“Even then that’s quite challenging.”

Isori shrugged at Tatsuya’s point.

At the same time, accompanied by the typing sounds on a traditional keyboard — the sound from Suzune’s favored traditional keyboard — Suzune turned back this way.

“Was it really a student from our school?”

After finishing her inspection, Suzune organized the materials and joined the conversation.

“No, that remains a ‘maybe’.”

“Even the uniform wouldn’t be that difficult to obtain if they tried.”

Hearing Tatsuya and Isori’s replies, Suzune fell into thought.

“Isori-kun and Chiyoda-san should have access to the student roster.”

Isori was a member of the Student Council and Kanon was the Chief of the Public Moral Committee, so they had the power to review the student roster. Of course, the amount of private information available was zero, so they could only make a cursory inspection of mug shots and full photos.

“Kanon was the only one who got a partial glimpse from the side of the face, so we have to be careful we don’t exclude the suspect. Also, with nearly 300 female students on campus, there’s no way to identify our target if we can’t narrow it down to a manageable number.”

Isori wasn’t referring to this as a hypothetical situation.

In reality, these were Kanon’s words after attempting that this morning.

“Yesterday, the only thing we could say is that one side was chasing the other. Even if we know who the culprit was, the only thing we could do is put her under surveillance, which is the same thing as doing nothing.”

Suzune and Isori were aware of what Tatsuya was saying.

Monitoring students that haven’t broken any rules — technically, using a flashbang while escaping could constitute a problem — may lead to accusations of stalking.

At this stage, there was nothing they could do except be on their guard.




By the time Tatsuya returned to class, Erika already took over his seat.

“Ah, you’re really early today.”

She quickly discovered Tatsuya’s presence and rose from the chair.

She wasn’t impudent enough to keep sitting there. After Tatsuya sat down, she sat on the edge of the desk itself, which was exercising considerable restraint on her part.

“What were you guys talking about?”

Still, just as Erika observed, he was quite early today.

He didn’t immediately face towards the terminal, but struck up a conversation with Mizuki, who sat next to him.

The conversation target was Mizuki because she wore an uneasy expression on her face.

“She said she felt someone watching her.”

However, the one who answered was Erika.

“Watching her?”

At his renewed question, Mizuki hesitantly nodded.

“Early in the day, I felt an annoying gaze on me. A nauseating gaze that’s lurking in the darkness somewhere.”

“A stalker perhaps?”

“That is impossible. I’m not a worthwhile target to be pursued.”

The likeliest possibility was presented first, but Mizuki shot that one down by repeatedly shaking her head as if to dispel a ridiculous notion.

“I’m not the target. I think I’m just part of a much larger web being cast out.”

Her vague words were likely because she wasn’t able to express herself very well.

On the other hand, Tatsuya knew perfectly what she was trying to convey.

“In other words, the target isn’t a single student, but many students and professors or even the school at large. Is that what you mean?”

“Ah, uh…… That may be my mistake too.”

The uncertain attitude was also one facet of her personality. Since they had no evidence, there was nothing for it.

“No, I think Shibata-san is onto something.”

Yet, as if to shore up Mizuki’s flagging confidence, Mikihiko arrived and spoke in the affirmative.

“Since yesterday morning, the spirits on campus have been thrown into an unnatural uproar. I think someone must have thrown down a Shiki.”

Since Erika occupied Tatsuya’s seat, Leo didn’t keep turning around like he usually did. However, he whirled around after hearing Mikihiko’s words.

“Shiki, as in a shikigami from SB Magic?”

Mikihiko nodded at Leo’s inquiry.

“It’s a little difficult to tell since they used a different type than we do, but there’s definitely a Magician of unknown origin snooping around here.”

“It’s not that rare of an occurrence, is it?”

Erika’s skepticism also held merit.

Even though this was a high school, they were still affiliated with the magic universities and had access to many important documents. With so many talented Magicians in its faculty, First High was often the target of individuals who homed in on magic abilities.

“Generally speaking, if they are blocked by the defensive magics hung on the walls, they usually don’t come back the same day. But this opponent continues his assault no matter how many times they’ve been beaten back. The fact that they’re searching for something isn’t surprising, but this is the first time I’ve seen such sheer obstinacy since coming to school here.”

Mikihiko responded to Erika’s rather tactful objection with a confident rejoinder of his own.

“……Mikihiko, just then, you said they used a different sort of magic than we did, correct?”

“Indeed I did.”

Mikihiko was quite concerned by Tatsuya’s choice of words and nervously confirmed Tatsuya’s question.

“Are you saying a shikigami from a different branch of the Shinto System? Or are you saying that it’s fundamentally different from this country’s Ancient Magic?”

He had no idea that the contents of such a carelessly phrased sentence could be mined from another direction; Mikihiko’s expression grew solemn.

“I think that’s not a magic spell from our country.”

“Hey, are you talking about foreign spies?”

“Isn’t that the exact point he’s making?”

Leo’s wide-eyed stare completely contrasted against Erika’s light words, but in reality both of them were on the same wavelength.

“Such conspicuous behavior.”

“They’re doing whatever they please. What the heck are the police doing?”

Thanks to Tatsuya’s words, Erika directed her ire towards the law enforcement.

Rather than being outraged at public officials slacking on the job, she appeared to be scolding her family members instead, which prompted an “Ah?” thought from both Tatsuya and Mikihiko.




Meanwhile, Inspector Chiba of the Kanagawa Prefecture Police — more like exiled from the main office to the Kanagawa Prefecture Police Department — sneezed as if on cue.

“……What’s wrong, Inspector? You suddenly look agitated.”

Sergeant Inagaki, who was currently investigating the illegal entry incident at the Yokohama Harbor, directed a look at his immediate superior’s suspicious action.

“Ah, for some reason I feel cold all of a sudden.”

“Are you OK? We’re busy enough as it is, don’t even try to pretend to be ill.”

“What do you mean pretend to be ill, you……”

Inspector Chiba’s voice had a tinge of a reprimand mixed in, which Inagaki promptly ignored.

“Inagaki-kun, you should at least respect the chain of command.”

At Chiba’s words, Inagaki gave him a skeptical look.

“You’re in no position to say that” was written all over his face, but the words that came out of his mouth were entirely different.

“Compared to that, do we need to continue taking testimonials? I doubt we’ll find any more witnesses even if we go further.”

Inagaki had a point there. After many days of recording testimonies, they received no new information on those who penetrated the border.

Chiba wore a self-depreciating grin as he looked at Inagaki, whom he saw more as a partner than a subordinate.

“Of course there are witnesses, it’s just that they choose to remain silent.”

“Inspector, you mean……”

Inagaki seemed to pick out something from his superior’s delicate tone as his eyes sharpened.

“Hey, don’t scare anybody.”

“I think the Inspector is the terrifying one. Did you notice something?”

“Relax, I didn’t do anything off the book. Well, they say snakes go through snake paths, so let’s take a look at the snake’s den.”

Hearing Chiba’s proposal, Inagaki wore an unwilling expression.

“Backdoor dealings are still against the law……”

“I think this still falls within acceptable parameters, right? Not like this is the time to worry over small details like that.”

“Uh…… Is that so?”

As Inagaki was nodding and looking for a counter argument, Chiba had already taken a seat in the driver’s seat of the plainclothes police car parked in the free parking area. After verifying that his partner had climbed on board, Chiba took the car towards the high class residential sector dominated by foreigners.




The destination for the plainclothes patrol car carrying Inspector Chiba and Sergeant Inagaki was the parking lot for a cafe located in the Yokohama Hills area. After Chiba turned off the engine, Inagaki turned a sour face on him.

“Inspector, I have nothing against taking a break here and there, but weren’t we headed for the ‘snake’s den’?”

At his subordinate who was leveling a hard look at him that blatantly accused him of being lazy, Inspector Chiba responded with a regretful expression.

“This is the ‘snake’s den’.”

“Ah?”

After hurriedly catching up to his superior who had already disembarked and was locking the door with a remote, Inagaki looked over the cafe once more as he stood next to Chiba.

At first glance, this was a quiet, peaceful cafe. The quaint windows modeled after a cabin in the mountains had a pair of shutters that were currently open and not trying to hide anything at all.

“Ah, calling him a snake would be disrespectful to the owner. The owner’s intelligence network is quite sophisticated and he doesn’t have a criminal record either.”

“Are you saying he’s a big fish that we haven’t pinned anything on yet?”

“I think he would prefer the term professional businessman over a big fish.”

Inspector Chiba lightly shrugged and opened the “Rotterbart” doors.



Thanks to its proximity to tourist locations, there were quite a few customers present, even though it was already past the time for usual luncheon.

Still, the place wasn’t very rowdy.

The mood within the cafe seemed to reflect the owner’s personality as each of the customers sat there quietly enjoying their drinks. All present belonged to a slightly older generation. Any assumption that they were all tourists would be incorrect, as the majority of them appeared to be regular patrons who favored this establishment in particular.

Chiba sat in the second chair in one corner of the counter (Inagaki occupied the first) and ordered two cups of coffee from the owner.

The owner appeared to be a businessman on the outside, but Chiba knew very well that he hadn’t abandoned his other trade either. Still, the conversation was stillborn before the coffee arrived and just sitting there seemed to be a waste of time, so he took this opportunity to glance around the place.

Off to the side of the counter, a coffee mug that had just been used sat there likely because the customer had just left in a hurry so the owner didn’t have time to recover the mug. What a shame that such a wonderful coffee was just wasted like that. As he ruminated over this idea in boredom, Chiba suddenly discovered that while he was fixated on the coffee mug, the customer he thought had departed in a hurry had returned.

The one who sat down next to the counter was a young woman roughly Chiba’s age.

He kept his face forward while surreptitiously glancing at the woman’s features.

At first glance, she didn’t possess incredible beauty. She wore a plain tunic and skirt, but upon closer inspection, she possessed delicate facial features and an outstanding figure.

This gave Chiba the feeling that she intentionally applied a small amount of makeup.

After drinking in these details, he wordlessly shifted his gaze forward.

He should be calling himself out on his idiocy.

His excuse for not asking a few questions in a professional capacity was because of her inconspicuous appearance, but his actions just now were practically outright flirting.

Inagaki’s suspicious gaze was starting to hurt.

The owner behaved as his cool appearance suggested and continued to silently prepare the coffee.

Chiba could only sit there and wait for the coffee to be served.

At this time, an unexpected laughter broke the silence.

He could only use his eyes to verify this, but just as he expected, her shoulders were shaking as she bowed her head forward.

“……I apologize. I was still thinking of how to handle a conversation, then you just went ahead and sat there. So it’s true that you’re not adept at handling women, O heir of the Chiba Family?”

Inspector Chiba was astounded, and not because she was dead on regarding his personality.

Nor was it a major secret that he was the heir of the Chiba Family.

Still, he never tried to proactively publicize his identity or picture through public relations.

In terms of publicized information, his brother Naotsugu far surpassed him.

Besides criminals or those affiliated with the police, anyone able to tell that he was Chiba Toshikazu on sight would have to hail from a select group of the world’s population.

Namely, people who wielded magic in live combat.

“You are……”

“Pleased to meet you, Inspector Chiba. You may call me Fujibayashi Kyouko.”

This time Chiba was truly struck speechless.

The daughter of the Fujibayashi Family renowned for their prowess in Ancient Magic and granddaughter of Kudou Retsu, one of the elders in the Japanese magic community, stood before him smiling without reserve.




It had been a long time since Tatsuya’s party of eight had passed through the school gates together.

“Tatsuya-kun, have you finished all the preparations for the Thesis Competition?”

Even though the eight of them hadn’t congregated recently, the one who first asked this question for some unknown reason was Honoka, who attended the Student Council with Miyuki and departed with Tatsuya on a daily basis.

“I can only say we’ve finished this stage. Right now, we still have to worry about the minute details like preparing the models for the presentation and assorted adjustments.”

“Sounds tough. Speaking of which, Mizuki’s helping out with the model production, right?”

Erika didn’t belong to either the Student Council or the Club Activities Group, yet was still curiously well informed as she shook her ponytail back and forth as she looked towards Mizuki.

“Ah, yes. I’m helping out a Year 2 senpai. Even though I’m not really doing anything.”

“We left the model entirely to Isori-senpai, so it makes sense that Year 2 students make up the bulk of the production personnel.”

“Hm~, so what does Tatsuya do?”

Leo took this opportunity to ask Tatsuya, who had voiced his support for Mizuki.

“I perform calibration for the magic techniques used during the presentation.”

“……Isn’t it usually the other way around?”

“Really? In terms of producing objects, I think Isori-senpai’s several leagues ahead of me.”

“Well, Kei-senpai does fit the ‘alchemist’ impression more than a ‘magister’. I guess this is the right tool for the job.”

Seeing Tatsuya tilt his head, Erika wryly smiled and expressed her agreement.

“Alchemist? RPG?”

Shizuku continued to keep her head tilted to one side.

“Using that as an analogy, what class would Tatsuya be?”

Suddenly, Mizuki sprouted this question.

“He would be a mad scientist of course.” [Erika] “That’s not from an RPG.” [Shizuku] “Then, maybe a sage dwelling in the remote lands far removed from civilization that imparts a secret technique.” [Erika] “A martial sage then.” [Leo] “An evil wizard scheming to conquer the world?” [Erika] “I think a Demon King would be more suitable.” [Mikihiko] “No, no, no, after defeating the Demon King, turns out I’m the real man behind the man~. Doesn’t he fit being the Final Boss who bars the main character’s way?” [Leo] “How come everyone doesn’t think he fits the hero?” [Honoka] “Forget it, Honoka. I do give off an evil vibe after all.” [Tatsuya] “Onii-sama, strength alone is the true justice.” [Miyuki] “Oh snap, as expected of the Demon King’s sister!” [Erika]

……And thus, a vibrant discussion began.



Even though they were walking along and bickering as students do, Tatsuya never let down his guard.

After reaching the intersection that leads to a few small stores, Tatsuya turned to face the direction where he felt someone watching him.

“Want to head over there?”

In response to Tatsuya’s suggestion to take a detour and incur more time spent to handle the pursuit,

“Agreed!”

“Tatsuya will probably be very busy starting tomorrow.”

“Indeed. Let’s grab a cup of tea.”

Erika, Leo, and Mikihiko’s responses seemed a little too eager. They likely each had their own agenda in mind.

Tatsuya feigned ignorance and pushed open the door that led to the “Eine Brise” Cafe.

Unfortunately, their usual two tables that seated four people each weren’t available to be joined together, so the eight of them crowded around the counter and the table that stood closest.

The ones next to the counter were Tatsuya, Miyuki, Honoka, and Mizuki (In order of seating, there was Mizuki, Miyuki, Tatsuya, and Honoka).

At the table, Erika sat with Shizuku while Leo and Mikihiko shared the other side.

From an outsider’s perspective, Tatsuya would undoubtedly be the scoundrel with a harem of several beauties serving him.

“Ah~, welcome, welcome. Seems you’re just as popular as usual, Tatsuya-kun.”

Eh, forget outsiders, even the owner of the establishment who was familiar with their group cast a cold gaze from the other side of the counter.

“I’m sure the owner would be just as popular if you would just shave off that beard.”

Tatsuya intentionally retaliated with the taboo word popular.

“That’s true, Owner. That beard is a darn waste and makes you look rather old.”

Thanks to Mizuki’s innocent nature, she naturally provided supporting fire.

“Old, eh…… Mizuki-chan certainly doesn’t hold anything back.”

His beard definitely qualified as a mess. The owner sighed deeply while gently brushing his beard in order.

Despite the gray coloring, the owner wasn’t nearly as ancient as Mizuki made him out to be.

More like he was quite young actually. Certainly he wasn’t yet 30 years of age.

His hair color and beard were both gray, likely due to genetics. After all, the owner was a quarter German (“Eine Brise” meant “slight wind” in German, which warmed Leo’s heart enough to make him a frequent patron).

Still, the only feature that marked his foreign lineage was his hair color, as his pupils were black and his face was thin and angular in the Asian fashion. Even though he had the gentle aura of a handsome male, the owner seemed to be very particular about his appearance and took great pains to cultivate his beard and hair to create a more masculine image.

Nevertheless, Tatsuya and company felt that the beard didn’t suit him very well, but the scent of coffee more than compensated for that. Of course, all eight of them ordered coffee.

“Eh…… So you’re appearing in the Thesis Competition.”

While the water was on the broil, the owner inquired the reason why they hadn’t frequented here recently and responded with an appropriately exaggerated nod.

“You’re quite capable despite your Year 1 student status.”

The owner’s feelings weren’t just idle talk to pass the time. Speaking of which, even though the owner didn’t have any magic talent of his own, the very fact that he opened a store on the road to the magic high school implied that he knew a few details regarding the world of Magicians. Occasionally during their idle conversations, he could surprise Tatsuya and the others with news or trivia that they didn’t know about before.

“It’s Yokohama’s turn to host the event this year, right? My old house is in Yokohama. The setting will be in the International Conference Center like usual, eh? That’s quite close to my house.”

The owner continued to speak as he used this opportunity to pour the coffee from the kettle into the mugs.

“Where’s your old house in Yokohama?”

Mizuki asked this question as she took the coffee for four people from the owner on a tray in place of a waitress.

“There’s a cafe called ‘Rotbart’ halfway up the Yokohama Hills.”

“So your old house is also a cafe.”

“Indeed. If you get a chance, make sure you stop by. I would love to hear an unreserved opinion on who serves a better cup of coffee between my father and I.”

“Owner, you’re a heck of a salesman.”

Shizuku returned the tray in place of Mizuki and offered a direct retort that caused both sides of the counter to burst into laughter.



By the time Tatsuya’s mug was down to its last third, Erika had already drained her cup in one gulp and silently placed the mug back (a sign of excellent upbringing on her part) and rose to her feet.

“Erika-chan?”

“I need to use the restroom.”

After replying to Mizuki, who had raised her head in question, she lightly walked towards the back of the store.

“Oh!”

Afterwards, Leo immediately pressed a hand to his pocket and stood up.

“Sorry, phone call.”

Leo stepped outside after dropping that line.

“Mikihiko, what are you doing?”

Tatsuya’s gaze returned from Leo’s oddly polite behavior to rest on the notebook (more like a small journal) that lay open next to Mikihiko’s hand.

“Uh, well, there’s a few things I have to write down so I don’t forget them.”

As Mikihiko replied back, the hand holding a pen never stopped moving.

“You’ll be discovered if your movement is too obvious, so make sure to dial it down.”

After Tatsuya said this and swept a razor sharp glance behind Mikihiko’s back — and not his surroundings — he kept his back to the counter and continued sipping his coffee like nothing happened.




“Old man, want to have some fun?”

Even though this was an alley with sparse traffic, the man almost dropped the drink in his hand upon hearing these words before the sun had even set.

Turning around, he found a young girl with a ponytail that could be described as “beautiful” in a heartbeat standing at the intersection where he was keeping an eye on the cafe’s backdoor. She kept both hands held behind her back as she smiled happily.

However, upon recognizing her face, the man became anxious for a wholly different reason.

“What are you talking about? You should be more careful with yourself.”

“Ah? I just said ‘have some fun’. What exactly did you take that for?”

The young girl continued to wear an innocent smile as she tilted her head to one side. There was no doubt about it, she was one of the people close to his surveillance target.

“Don’t mock adults. Now stop messing around and go home.”

He was mentally sweating buckets, so all he could do was put on his game face and continue to act like “an adult annoyed by a child’s antics and about to leave”.

“The sun is about to set. If you stay in a place with little traffic like this, you risk running into the phantom killer.”

As he said this, the man turned his back on the young girl.

Only to stop dead in his tracks.

“……By phantom killer, you mean someone like me?”

Directly in front of him, a bulky youth chuckled while smacking his fist that was covered with a black glove into his other hand that also wore a black glove.

“Didn’t you know? Phantom killers refer to ‘magicians who just happen to be “passing through” ’.”

Within the young girl’s happy reply to the young man, the man began to feel increasingly uneasy and turned around again.

The young girl wielded a retractable police baton and fell into a combat stance.

She smoothly raised the police baton in her hand, but that simplistic motion caused an overpowering pressure to resonate from the young woman in an instant.

If he had lowered his guard, that “pressure” would have sent the man to his knees…… From this, he knew what that was.

That was her fighting spirit.

Not killing intent, the wish to crush the life from one’s opponent, but a pure desire to seek combat.

“Scary…… So you’re the type of woman who only reveals her true nature in these kinds of places.”

He heard a voice merrily commenting on the situation.

Despite his inability to verify the conditions behind him, he believed that the young man must have made this remark with a grin on his face.

“Help! Thieves!”

There was no way for him to escape. If that was the case, the man decided he might as well call for help.

He possessed a modicum of ability.

Even if he wasn’t the most talented individual, he didn’t believe that he could be vanquished by fifteen or sixteen year olds.

Regardless, he was currently in the middle of an assignment, so he chose to avoid confrontations if possible, given that squaring off against them served no benefit towards his mission parameters.

“Wow~, how weak……”

“No, no, I think you should praise his decisive judgment, right?”

The action the man chose seemed to gravely disappoint the young girl.

But the young girl didn’t let go of the police baton, nor did the young man drop his raised fists.

—Afterward, nobody came to answer the man’s calls for help.

“Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that it’s useless for you to call for help, OK? After all, no one drops by this area.”

“More like no one can even approach. We’ve already set up a barrier around here with our ‘understanding’ as the foundation, so you’re not leaving here without knocking us out, got it?”

Hearing the girl’s words, the man finally realized that nobody had passed by since the start of their confrontation.

They found out.

He was out of options.

The man retrieved the cup he dropped earlier and drew to his full height.

Wearing a thin jacket, he raised his hands like he was protecting his head — which was what they thought until he suddenly turned towards Leo and dropped his left arm to a 90 degree angle at the height of his stomach.

“Hmph…… The boxing stance known as the Hitman Style? I thought you actually carried weapons of some sort……”

“You idiot, just because he didn’t pull one out doesn’t mean he’s not carrying one!”

Hearing the warning Erika threw out, the man clucked his tongue.

Still, beyond that, he didn’t appear to be overly anxious.

He didn’t have any need to keep up pretenses.

There was no time for that.

The cowardly middle-aged man who was just screaming had warped into an experienced fighter who was closing in on Leo.

His lowered arm whipped towards Leo and landed blows like rain falling to the earth.

The bullet-like punches came crashing towards Leo’s face.

The continuous chain of attacks persisted without pause, which gave proof to the fact that this man was a wolf and not a sheep.

However, neither Leo nor Erika was surprised by this turnout.

Through Erika’s insight developed through long years of training and Leo’s natural instincts, they already detected that the man’s real nature was that of a wolf, no, a highly-trained hunting hound.

With astonishing speed.

Matched with incredible power.

And most importantly, the ability to move at a speed that surpassed human physical abilities without a trace of magic usage.

He had launched dozens of punches in less than 10 seconds without leaving any room for retaliation, so Leo could only move his arms left and right to defend himself.

Finally, there was a chink in Leo’s defenses and a fist bypassed Leo’s defenses and crashed straight into his face.

Pow, with a sound of a rubber balloon bursting, Leo went flying backwards.

Without wasting any time to verify the result, the man immediately swiftly whirled around.

Using the centripetal force when turning around, he flung a flying dagger towards Erika.

Clang, the crisp sound of metallic impact.

Erika used her police baton to deflect the dagger.

Since she swung her police baton from inside to out, there was an opening in her forward defenses.

Without missing a beat, the man’s left fist swung towards Erika’s face. However, the police baton pulled back to defend at a speed that surpassed the man’s fist, so he pulled back.

Not only did he pull back the punch, the man’s entire body jumped backwards. —Yet, in the next instant.

“Gah!”

The man’s back took a direct hit from a powerful shoulder tackle and he went face first into the ground.

“……Ouch, that hurt. This guy isn’t a normal human being. Still, I didn’t feel any machinery during contact…… Maybe he’s using medicinal enhancements?”

After applying a tackle from behind, Leo rubbed his chin where he took the hit and murmured at the man stretched out on the ground without letting down his guard.

“……You’re in no position to talk. Just then, you definitely took a solid blow to the face.”

Compared to the groaning man who was trying to find purchase with his hands, Erika seemed to be more wary of Leo as she said this.

“Of course. After all, as a Magician, a fourth of me is thanks to the research labs. I have no inclination to say that this is entirely due to my natural genes.”

Leo chuckled wryly at Erika’s piercing gaze and ruthlessly kicked at the prone man’s limbs.

“Ooph!”

“Stay down. We don’t want your life. We just want to know why you’re following us around.”

Leo spared a glance at Erika to find her utterly shocked at his barbaric behavior wholly unlike that of a normal person before raising a foot off the ground.

The implication was obvious.

“……Wait a second…… I got it, I surrender…… Originally, I never…… was your enemy…… It’s not worth…… getting killed over……”

“That’s true. If it wasn’t the two of us here, your attack would have killed us for sure.”

“Aren’t you…… the same……”

Coughing in between his words, the man sat up.

“If I hadn’t strengthened my flesh, that hit would’ve ruptured my internal organs.”

The pain must have largely passed, seeing as how the man still sat on the ground but was able to speak more fluently.

“If I didn’t think you were enhanced, I wouldn’t have done that in the first place.”

Leo’s tone wasn’t concerned in the slightest.

“Regardless, since you’re not our enemy, then give us the low down. You can’t expect us to keep this barrier up forever.”

“OK. It’s not my intent to draw attention to myself anyways.”

The man seemed to look past all this and sighed in relief.

“Start with your name, since you already know ours at this point.”

“Jiro Marshall.”

The man answered Leo’s question, but there was no way to tell if this was his true name or not.

“I am unable to reveal any details regarding my identity, but I can say that I am not affiliated with any government organization. That is all.”

“So you’re black ops.”

Again, the man didn’t affirm nor deny.

“……And then? Since you won’t tell the truth even if we asked, then why don’t you talk about your purpose as well as the current situation?”

“My task is to monitor the magic high school students and prevent cutting edge magic technology from falling into the hands of the East. I am to take action in the event that magic technology that could constitute a military threat is leaked to the East.”

At Leo’s impatient urging, the man who called himself Jiro replied back in a business-like manner.

The East was a term favored by USNA intelligence agents and military personnel after the last great war. Even Leo and Erika were familiar with knowledge on that level.

That being said, this did not prove the man’s connection with the USNA intelligence community. In order to confuse his affiliation, he may have intentionally used terms specific to a certain region.

“At the very least, your employer isn’t someone in this country, right? Why bother with all this?”

Hearing the skeptical implication behind Leo’s words, the man shook his head like he was saying “Seriously……”.

“And here I thought this country’s peaceful naiveté had been cured, though I guess I can’t apply the same standard to teenagers…… Military balance across the globe isn’t just one country’s problem. If this country’s technical expertise was handed to the East, then the West’s technological advantage may be lost. Regardless of whether it’s the New Soviet Union whose interest lies in improving existing Magic Sequences or the Pan Asian Alliance who emphasizes restoration of old magics over advancing modern magic, everyone is searching for new practical applications of technology in magic engineering for military purposes. Not just this country, but the USNA and the nations of Western Europe have seen large increases in spies that target magic engineering. Even your school has become the target of the East as well.”

“Peaceful naiveté is an old term from decades ago, and if you really wanted to creepy peeper then you should be more cautious. Didn’t we easily discover that you were following us?”

Irritated by the man’s smug attitude, Erika ruthlessly attacked the man, but she didn’t object to the actual contents of the man’s message.

“Exactly. I’m not a spy, I’m just tasked with stopping their activities. Since I’m not your enemy, there’s no conflict of interest here.”

The man stood up and made a show of brushing off the dirt.

Mockingly — in reality, sarcasm probably made up 30% — the man delicately brushed his pant leg before straightening up.

In his hand was a pistol that could easily be hidden in the palm of his hand. The muzzle was pointed at Erika.

“Tch!”

“You!”

“The fact that I didn’t pull this out earlier is proof that I’m not an enemy.”

“……Things might get a little hairy if you used a gun. Lots of evidence will be left behind.”

At Erika’s furious words, the man smiled meaningfully.

“That’s true as well. Next, I’ve said everything that needs to be said, so allow me to bid adieu. May I trouble you to alert your companions to take down the barrier?”

Despite his bantering tone and attitude, there were no weaknesses to exploit in his stance. It would be suicidal for Erika and Leo to press the issue here.

With the advancements in CADs, modern magic could achieve speeds that rivaled firearms on some level. Still, this didn’t mean that they were “faster than guns”, nor were they even “as fast as guns”. When compared to firearms that could fire bullets that pass through the human body with the click of a trigger, modern magic still had to go through the process of reading the Activation Sequence and constructing the Magic Sequence. Though magic had more versatility than firearms, possessed superior firepower and could even provide cover against bullets, that was only under the condition that the speed differential wasn’t a problem. When faced with the situation that one bullet could be fatal or render someone unable to keep fighting, “a speed differential on some level” became the difference between victory and defeat. And that was the situation they were faced with right now.

Mikihiko was probably monitoring the situation here with magic the entire time. Before Erika and Leo could reply, Mikihiko already disabled the barrier.

“—And thus I bid you farewell. Oh yes. Allow me to give you two one final suggestion. Please convey to your companions to be wary of their surroundings at all times. Even on campus, don’t let down your guard.”

As he said this, the man removed a small canister from his coat pocket.

After pressing a button on the canister, he threw it into the middle of the triangle that the three of them formed.

Erika and Leo both leaped backwards at the same time.

With a small explosion, a dense, white smoke rapidly spread outwards.

The two of them closed their eyes and covered their mouths and only opened them after judging that there was no poison involved. By that time, the man who called himself Jiro Marshall had long gone.




At the Rotbart Cafe in the Yokohama Hills, Inspector Chiba and Fujibayashi were still deep in their conversation. Something had piqued Fujibayashi’s fancy, causing her to chatter on to the point that Chiba never had an opportunity to get down to business with the owner. Still, owing to Fujibayashi’s skillful verbatim, Chiba was highly invested in the conversation as well. On some level, Chiba didn’t feel that speaking with her interfered with the investigation, but his partner Inagaki certainly didn’t seem nearly as interested.

Just as Chiba was about to completely forget the reason why he came here, Fujibayashi’s cellphone rang. Despite the sound not being loud enough to disrupt anyone else, Chiba still heard it from his seat next to her.

Fujibayashi pulled a smartphone from her bag and glanced at the subject heading. After perusing the message, she turned around and flashed Chiba a secret smile. That smile perfectly displayed her dazzling features that simply put her ordinary makeup to shame.

Chiba’s pulse spiked to a rate wholly unbefitting of his age.

“My apologies, Inspector, may I take my leave for a moment?”

Even though Fujibayashi’s eyes never hinted at any ulterior motive or hidden meaning, Chiba was immediately able to grasp that Fujibayashi had work to attend to.

“—Oh, of course, by all means.”

She rose from her seat and nodded in greeting to Chiba, passed her credit card to the owner and left for her electric car that was in the parking lot.



Taking a seat behind the wheel, Fujibayashi switched the smartphone display over to the dashboard screen.

Cars that had adopted the palm pilot control schematic had no need for steering wheels. This was a natural course of events for a system that incorporated acceleration, deceleration, and directional control entirely. The palm pilot control schematic was used to create a more direct driving experience and especially to avoid blind spots by switching the traditional dashboard for a varied control panel (such as a larger display monitor with multiple functions). With a few extra modifications in place, technological prowess in the car could match that of a workstation at home.

However, Fujibayashi’s personal vehicle was equipped with a system a level, maybe several levels higher. Although this was a small two seat sports car, it had the same processing power as that of a combat command vehicle. Equipped with a highly sensitive and powerful communication device, whenever Fujibayashi added her magic to the mix, the sheer electronic warfare capabilities at its disposal certainly deserved the title “Electronic Combat Vehicle”.

“Looks like Tatsuya’s friends ran into a little bit of trouble.”

She wasn’t unconsciously murmuring to herself, but using that specific term to target her magic. By using Tatsuya’s “connections” as markers, she was overlapping the information dimension with the electronic intelligence network.

“Yoshida Mikihiko, the one-time prodigy of the Yoshida Family. Even though there’s some degree of improvement since his adolescent years, I still wish he would pay more attention on the streets.”

Names are a symbol of the actual body, so once the name was spoken, then one could home in on the actual body. Closely related individuals, essentially people who are closer on a mental scale, can be used as markers for magic by setting their movement, status, and names as specific variables.

“Even Ancient Magic will leave traces in the observation system.”

Compared to modern magic, Ancient Magic, especially SB Magic, was much more difficult to capture by the cameras of the observation system. The difficulty wasn’t that it was harder to catch the magic being invoked since the cameras would still record it, but determining who was the one wielding the magic in the first place. The emergency mission that Fujibayashi was currently tasked with was to overwrite the areas where the magic was recorded.

Even though erasing recordings for the improper use of magic wasn’t within Fujibayashi’s job description, she knew very well that it was integral that the people surrounding Tatsuya didn’t stand out too much. If there were too many flags being raised, the prey would be on guard and no longer continue its pursuit. In other words, Kazama and company were using Tatsuya as bait—

(—On that point, I doubt you would mind.)

With these words in mind, the “Electron Sorceress” activated her unique ability.




The operative from an unknown country called Jiro Marshall stopped running after using his enhanced legs to run the distance between bus stops. He stopped running at such a dangerous speed that would draw attention to himself not because he judged it to be safe.

Actually, it was the exact opposite.

Even though he was running at a pace that no one could match no matter how hard they trained, something was continuously following behind him. He hadn’t verified what that “something” was, but Jiro Marshall was strongly suspicious whether that “something” was even human.

There was no need to check whether it was the pair of teenagers from before. He was not a moron who allowed his opponents who he was in a standoff with to follow him without his knowledge. Regardless of whether his pursuer was a Magician or an enhanced human being, the likeliest possibility was that this was an enemy. As a solo operative, Marshall didn’t have a team for this mission. Even if he received unexpected reinforcements, he would still receive a message ahead of time to avoid friendly fire. However, since the start of this mission, he never received any intel of this sort.

(—Where are you hiding?)

Marshall slightly lowered his head to concentrate on listening and, using his extensive expertise, searched for the “aura” that was the most critical aspect of three dimensional sound. There was no way he could fail to detect the man following, no, pursuing him. Even if that guy was hidden, he should still be able to find him, Marshall thought.

Unfortunately, his prediction was entirely incorrect.

Suddenly detecting an unexpected “aura”, Jiro Marshall abruptly raised his head.

Directly in front of him, a young man stood there in silence.

Just now, he realized that any noise in front of him had been entirely muffled. Marshall was only able to physically detect the danger thanks to his instincts.

The man was exceptionally tall and well built, but his figure was East Asian. He wore a plain grab that consisted of a pair of gray sports pants and a gray jacket with a black jersey beneath. His features were not particularly eye-catching or ugly. From appearances, he was undoubtedly human — but Marshall had the inkling he was squaring off against a man eating beast.





Seeing the young man’s face, Marshall suddenly recalled where he knew him.

“The Devouring Tiger!”

In reality, it wasn’t that they had met before, since this was the first time he saw the man face to face.

“Lu Gonghu……”

The name of his opponent that unconsciously slipped from his lips headed the list of targets that he had to watch out for during his mission briefing. Rumored to be the one credited with the highest number of kills in melee combat from the Pan Asian Alliance, he was an S-ranked individual from the Pan Asian Alliance Special Ops.

By the time Marshall recovered his wits, he had already raised his right hand to aim the gun at Lu Gonghu. Born of reflex honed by countless hours of training, Marshall’s body had long since surpassed his mental facilities.

However, Marshall’s finger never clicked the trigger.

Faster than even his reflexes, Lu Gonghu’s fingers already pierced Marshall’s wrist. The inside of his wrist pierced by the other man’s thumb, the handgun slipped from Marshall’s hand to the ground.

Marshall could only blankly watch his handgun fall to the earth.

When was his wrist pierced? No, speaking of which, when did Lu Gonghu stand right next to him?

Marshall never caught a glimpse of Lu Gonghu’s movement.

As Marshall’s consciousness was wallowing in the pain that overwhelmed his surprise, his life had already fallen into eternal darkness.



Lu Gonghu swiftly retracted his right hand from where it was embedded in Marshall’s throat.

Even though his fingers were stained blood red, very little blood escaped from the wound.

Using his left hand that was free of any blood, Lu Gonghu removed a stack of paper from his chest pocket and carefully wiped away the bloodstains on his right hand.

Afterwards, he flung the papers soaked in Marshall’s blood onto the corpse. During the descent, the paper spread out to a handkerchief’s size and fell onto Marshall’s corpse.

The blood soaked paper suddenly ignited into flames that were redder than blood. The flames started from the center of the paper and spread outwards in a circular fashion.

Nothing existed within the inside of the circle. No matter if it was the ashes from the burnt paper, the clothes that covered the corpse, or even flesh, nothing remained.

After the flames consumed the paper, they began spreading across the corpse.

And so, the circular flames completely devoured the corpse.

Seeing the corpse vanish, Lu Gonghu turned to leave.

There was nary a human presence at the scene. Regardless of whether it was voices or footsteps, there was no trace that someone had ever been there.

The only thing that witnessed this scene was the broken camera that swayed near the intersection.





Chapter 5




Miyuki was somewhat surprised to see the ugly look that Erika wore when everyone showed up for the arranged lunch meeting in the cafeteria.

“Erika, is yesterday’s incident still weighing on your mind?”

Until the moment they separated at the bus station, Erika was extremely irritated that the suspected special agent from USNA intelligence got the last laugh during the final moments. Even though she didn’t verbalize her displeasure, her attitude was apparent from a glance.

This was already an incredibly frank admission on her part considering her usual antics where she used a mischievous smile to hide her true feelings. It was simply unheard of for her to brood on this until the second day.

At Miyuki’s question, Erika’s answer was half confirming and half dissenting.

“It’s not simply because we could only watch as he got away.”

The words, watch as he got away, seemed to denote her frustration, but apparently that wasn’t the full story.

“That guy’s words were really worrisome…… Don’t let down your guard even on campus, doesn’t that mean that some of the students……”

Mikihiko and Honoka didn’t participate in the incident back in April so they weren’t able to follow, but Tatsuya and Miyuki immediately grasped what was on Erika’s mind.

At the time, Sayaka had been an unwitting pawn for foreign agents posing as terrorists.

Even now, Sayaka was unable to put that behind her.

“If we’re putting on an encore for that unpleasant business, please count me out……”

Tatsuya was both in the know and understood those feelings, so he made a comment that ran counter to his personality in an effort to take care of Erika’s mood.

“Still, it’s not like we can arrest them if they haven’t even done anything yet.”

“That may be true……”

Her sulky tone hinted that she hadn’t fully accepted this, but at least he successfully defused her intent to do some snooping around on her own, Tatsuya thought.

Speaking of which, though Erika wasn’t a “goody two shoes” by any stretch, when something pertaining to one of her close friends arose, she would “change the subject” even when there wasn’t a direct connection.

“Yet, isn’t it to our disadvantage to always be reacting? That’s not a problem if it’s a head-on assault, but theft would be……”

“Not like we can always worry about something like that……”

Tatsuya smiled and shook his head at Leo and Mikihiko’s concerns.

“Since we don’t carry that data in a terminal on us, there’s no danger of physical theft. Originally, it would be strange to worry about theft or burglary on campus, no? Well, discreet photographs aren’t out of the question, but that issue wouldn’t be restricted to this competition only. To steal data from on campus, it would be more convenient to go after the documents hidden behind lower safeguards, but we’re not that silly. Is it possible that we have been misinformed by a suspicious individual?”

“Is that so…… But we still need to guard against the other person directly spying on you yesterday, so be careful.”

“I know.”

Even though Mikihiko’s words were largely bucking against Tatsuya’s explanation, he looked like he was satisfied with that answer.

Still, in Tatsuya’s eyes, Erika and Leo both gave him the impression that they remained silent because they wanted to say something more, but were unable to come up with any arguments of their own.




Compared to the 52 representatives selected for the Nine Schools Competition, the Thesis Competition only had three. —The difference in scale was so great that the event almost seemed pointless. Even so, the Thesis Competition was seen as an important event that rivaled the Nine Schools Competition itself.

One of the reasons was that this event was actually another stage for the nine magic high schools to determine a victor. Especially for schools that obtained undesirable results in the Nine Schools Competition, the desire to erase their old shame became a powerful motivator.

Another reason was that many students were able to participate beyond the selected three representatives.

The greatest difference between the debate and research competitions for non-magic high schools and the “National High School Students Magic Thesis Competition” was that a live demonstration was incorporated into the presentation.

In addition to the thesis presentation, a fully functional magic device was required to display the actual manifestation of the magic. Even though the presentation only required a model, this was no simple child’s toy that could be stuck together with glue and papers. The device needed to run reliably, or at least mimic reality — this was the Thesis Competition for magic high schools.

For this, the design of the magic device and the support systems involved, the controlling software, outer frame, required conditions and target production, testing personnel and supporting testers, individuals in charge of safety…… Near the actual deadline for the competition, the Technical Club and Arts Club would naturally join in. Even clubs that work on purely theoretical ideas and students with outstanding grades would be mobilized for the success of the official competition.

The total number of participants for the report preparation exceeded that of the Nine Schools Competition.

Since the official competition was set for the Sunday two weeks from now, not only was the campus filled with sounds of machinery and magic activating, “Self Design” and “Self Study” sprouted up to squeeze more time in. The open area in the quad was swiftly filled to capacity by prototypes, calculation devices, and other machinery. Even consolation squads formed by female volunteers loaded with drinks and snacks entered the fray. In order to support these consolation squads, the Robotics Research Club chipped in the Humanoid Home Helpers as well.

“Ah, there they are.”

The person Erika was looking for stood amid the ruckus.

“Hey—, Tatsuya-kun—”

Next to Erika, who was shouting while waving her arms back and forth, Leo turned his body in another direction. Mikihiko chose to simply move two meters behind Erika to a safe distance. The two of them were probably pretending not to know her.

“Erika-chan, please don’t bother everyone……”

Mizuki wasn’t as brazen as Leo, so she still tugged at her friend’s sleeve despite knowing this would do nothing. —As expected, there was no effect.

Seeing Erika waltz over, Tatsuya stopped his hands and smiled wryly as if to say “what can I do”, but there were of course people who were visibly displeased by the interruption to the experiment.

“Chiba…… You, should probably take a look at your surroundings.”

As one of the guards on station, Kirihara was one of the unhappy ones.

“Eh~, Sayaka is observing too?”

However, Erika’s response, or more like her conversation target, was directed to Sayaka, who was standing next to Kirihara.

“What do I even say……”

“Erika……”

Kirihara spoke weakly while Sayaka had a wry smile of her own. Given that he didn’t fly into a rage, Kirihara must have matured somewhat.

“You don’t look like you’re just here to observe, Erika. What’s up?”

Still, seeing that the other upperclassmen besides Kirihara were about to burst out, Tatsuya quickly seized the initiative.

“Mizuki got called in to help, so I tagged along.”

Erika was always someone who did things her way, but that does not imply she was slow in any way. Noticing the warning, she didn’t waste any time with her response.

So that’s why, Tatsuya thought as he shifted his gaze to Mizuki, who was frantically apologizing to her senpais from the Arts Club.

“Erika, over here.”

Using this opportunity, as strange as it sounds, Miyuki reached out and pulled Erika into the crowd of observers.

Sayaka also left Kirihara’s side and sidled along Erika, while the interrupted activation of the magic device was restarted on Isori’s signal.

“What experiment are they doing? It looks like a giant light bulb.”

A transparent globe with a 120 mm diameter was supported on a stand with four legs, which did give the impression of being a giant light bulb. Of course, in this age, “light bulbs” had long since been retired from household use, so Mizuki tilted her head in confusion at Erika’s opinion.

“That is the Low Temperature Ionic Generator we’re using for the presentation.”

Miyuki obviously knew what a “light bulb” was, but she didn’t pay attention to Erika’s joke and directly answered her question.

“Low temperature? Weren’t we going for thermonuclear fusion?”

Mikihiko, who had also adopted Leo’s approach of pretending not to know one another, heard an unexpected term that forced him to abandon this pretense. (Speaking of which, Mikihiko still used formal speech when addressing Miyuki.)

Erika also seemed to remember her physics lessons and a question mark mushroomed over her head after a beat.

“Thermonuclear fusion is a type of reaction, so high temperature is required for the entire process.”

“…………”

“……My apologies, Yoshida-kun. I am unfamiliar with the details as well, please consult Onii-sama for a more in depth explanation.”

Seeing Mikihiko’s blank look, Miyuki added on that last sentence, prompting Mikihiko to say “please don’t bother” and furiously shake his head back and forth, sending his hair flying.

With a diminutive look at Mikihiko, Erika and Sayaka whispered quietly to one another. They frantically shut their traps when Miyuki leveled a smile in their direction (which didn’t reach her eyes).

From the start, Leo’s eyes blazed with curiosity as he silently stared at the experimental device.

In the midst of the unconscious silence, Isori sent Suzune a signal.

Suzune started supplying psions to the large, control board-shaped CAD that Tatsuya was operating.

The CAD functioned at a much higher strength and speed than the normal smaller CADs that were carried around and multiple complex Magic Sequences were being activated.

Under high pressure, hydrogen broke down into ions and the separated ions struck against the glass to emit light. Although this was only the simple effect of electricity caused by high pressure, they had already achieved electron separation without providing energy. In addition, in order to allow the electrons to break away from atomic attraction and move towards the outer perimeter, a highly complex spell had to be constantly sustained to change the Eidos.

“……So it really is a light bulb?”

Erika’s rude comment that slipped from her lips was fortunately covered by the cheers of “Excellent!”, “First phase successful!” and other related celebratory words. The others were the same, with Miyuki smiling quietly as if success was the only possible result, while Leo had two fists tightly clenched before his chest, Mikihiko gripped his arms and nodded, and Sayaka clapped as she jumped with joy.

The glass container continued to give off light for 10 seconds.

By the time the light faded, the excitement also wore off.

That was because they only finished with the largest piece and many more components still needed to be put together. The helpers that congregated for the experiment dispersed back to their stations, but Erika noticed Sayaka was staring in a certain corner.

“Saya, what’s up?”

“That child……”

She didn’t reply and murmured to herself.

“Hey, what’s going on!?”

“Hey, Mibu!?”

In order to catch up to Sayaka, who suddenly burst into a run, both Erika and Kirihara also started sprinting.

Leo was only a half a step behind them.

Wide-eyed with shock, Miyuki could only watch them leave until she noticed the female student with twin ponytails that Sayaka was chasing.




“Hold it right there!”

Hearing someone call out for her to stop from behind, or maybe because she realized she couldn’t outrun the pursuit, the female student opted to come to a halt on the grass in the courtyard.

“What is it?”

Turning around, the question in response was a little stiff. In a sense, her tone gave off a fearless impression.

“You are, a Year 1 student, correct?”

There were no distinctions for grade level on First High’s uniforms.

Sayaka’s question was based off the other student’s face and physical form.

“Indeed. Mibu Sayaka from Year 2 Class E. I am also a Course 2 student like yourself.”

The only difference was the lack of the school emblem, the distinction between Course 1 and 2 students.

“……Year 1 Class G, Hirakawa Chiaki.”

Upon being asked by an upperclassman to identify herself, the female student unwillingly gave her name.

She could hear more footsteps coming to a stop behind her.

Erika and the others caught up.

And heard that earlier self-introduction.

Immediately, she heard Kirihara murmur “Hirakawa?”

Sayaka was not familiar with that surname, but Kirihara had heard of it.

Still, the reason why Sayaka couldn’t let this Year 1 student go wasn’t because of her name, so she didn’t mind even if she had never heard of this name before.

Sayaka didn’t have the leisure to worry about things like that.

“Hirakawa-san, the device you’re carrying…… That’s a wireless password decoder, isn’t it?”

Hearing Sayaka’s accusation, Hirakawa Chiaki turned pale and hurriedly hid the terminal in her hand behind her back.

“I know even if you don’t admit it. That’s because I’ve used the same model before.”

Chiaki’s eyes widened in astonishment at Sayaka’s words.

Password decoders were malware devices used to steal passwords and, unlike the literal meaning, were also machines used to automatically break into verification systems and steal information. There were no legal uses for that item. In other words, used the same model before implied……

“……That’s right. I was also the cat’s paw for spies.”

A miserable expression spread across Sayaka’s face, but even then she continued to press onward as she stared at Chiaki.

“That’s why I must warn you. Stop now. The longer you’re with them, the more painful it will become.”

“……No matter how much I suffer, that’s none of senpai’s business.”

Chiaki turned her face to one side and replied in a cold tone.

An obvious rejection.

However, Sayaka did not shrink back at Chiaki’s cold reception.

“There’s no way I can just watch and do nothing!”

Sayaka’s tone hardened and her eyes turned fiery as she suddenly roared at Chiaki.

“Even though it’s been half a year, I still can’t stop myself from shaking at times. I don’t even realize that I’ve bit my lip open, or pierced my palm with my nails.”

Sayaka was actually shaking as she said this.

“Even though I don’t know who you’re mixed in with, this I know for sure. They will never take your needs into consideration. They will only use you, then promptly abandon you.”

Sayaka’s voice was filled with sincerity. She was not being hypocritical, these were her true feelings laid bare.

Nevertheless, the hatred that dwelt in Chiaki’s heart ran much deeper than Sayaka imagined.

“Of course I know that!”

That self-destructive voice and hate-filled eyes made Sayaka stop cold.

“It’s obvious that the mafia and terrorists don’t give a darn about the people they’re using. Senpai linked up with these people even without fully understanding that? My apologies for my rudeness, but senpai is so very childish.”

Those bitter words clearly conveyed to Sayaka that this Year 1 student was completely different than she was.

Sayaka had a goal she was aiming for, but was taken advantage of when she wasn’t sure what path to take.

It was true that she was hopelessly naive. Sayaka never planned to deny that point.

Still, Sayaka didn’t believe that this Year 1 student was any more mature than she was.

Even if she could achieve her heart’s desire after joining up with criminals, what would she do afterwards? What then? Would she return to high school as if nothing had happened, or actually continue acting as a member of a criminal organization? Sayaka knew that this Year 1 student never even took her future into consideration.

Right now, she was only stubbornly refusing to listen to anyone else’s words.

“Even if you continue on this self-destructive path you will obtain absolutely nothing. Nothing will remain behind!?”

However, Sayaka wasn’t going to back down. There were some things that needed to be stopped, by force if necessary. This was something she learned first hand.

“Senpai wouldn’t understand. I’m not teaming up with those guys because I want to get something.”

Regardless, the answer she received was almost naturally a powerful rejection.

She’s refusing to be persuaded, Sayaka faintly realized. That’s because she too was once like that.

Persuasion can be saved for later. If they let her escape now, this child will never be able to return to “this side” again. With this in mind, a slightly forceful approach couldn’t be avoided. —Sayaka made her decision.

“Kirihara-kun.”

“Ah.”

Kirihara immediately grasped Sayaka’s intention.

Unfortunately, neither of them were carrying heat, but they weren’t particularly worried.

This Year 1 student had no experience in martial arts or close combat. Both of them possessed the ability to tell this at a glance.

If they both attacked at the same time, the takedown should be fairly simple.

Objectively speaking, Sayaka and Kirihara’s judgement would be correct. —Under the condition that their opponent was unarmed.

The instant Sayaka and Kirihara advanced together, Chiaki hurtled a small container.

“Get down!”
