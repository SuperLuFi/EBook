	 Tatsuya's group arrived at the restaurant 3 minutes before the appointed time. A restaurant employee conducted these three young people who were not suitable for this place, showing nothing but a smile on their face.

	 Exactly at 17:00 Tatsuya, Miyuki and Minami entered the room in the traditional Japanese style.

	 There they were alone waiting for Katsuto.

	 "I'm sorry to have kept you waiting." - Tatsuya said and sat down, without asking permission to sit down.

	 - No, you are just in time. - Katsuto confirmed that they have nothing to blame themselves.

	 With a small gap from Tatsuya and Miyuki, followed by Minami. Miyuki sat on the pillow next to Tatsuya, and Minami sat right on the floor behind Miyuki.

	 All four sat in the "right" posture on their knees [Seiji]. None of them did any relaxing movements, showing that it was uncomfortable for them to sit like that. All looked long accustomed to the seiji.

	 - I'm sorry!

	 When Tatsuya and Katsuto's eyes had already met and they were about to begin, the front door opened and Mayumi and Mari entered the room.

	 - Excuse me, did we make you wait?

	 - No, we just arrived.

	 When asked by Mayumi, Tatsuya answered immediately. Katsuto was already ready to answer, but eventually closed his mouth, without saying anything.

	 Mayumi, with a sigh of relief, took her place next to Katsuto and opposite Miyuki. And Mari sat down next to Mayumi.

	 Seiji Mayumi looked better than ordinary female students, but compared to Tatsuya, Miyuki or Katsuto, she looked awkward anyway. Even Mari looked better in this matter.

	 - Okay, right away ... ...

	 Mayumi wanted to start negotiations (or better to call persuasion), but suddenly from behind the front door a voice was heard: "I'm sorry." Mayumi answered: "Yes, I'll ask." The door opened, and on the other side there appeared not the waitress, but the young mistress of this restaurant.

	 "Visitors came to us who called themselves your comrades ..." The hostess spoke with an impartial face.

	The surprise was natural, because everyone who was supposed to come was already here.

	 "Er, and who are they?"

	 Although Mayumi was also confused, she quickly recovered and asked.

	 - They introduced themselves as Saegusa Kasumi-sama and Izumi-sama.

	 - Er ...!?

	 Shortly after losing her speech, Mayumi asked Tatsuya and Miyuki "to wait a moment," and, without waiting for the mistress, walked to the entrance to the restaurant. Saying "I'm sorry," the landlady bowed and closed the door on the other side.

	 While they waited, Miyuki asked Tatsuya: "They are about this matter, are not they?"

	 "The business?" Tatsuya-kun, do you know anything about why the younger sisters of Mayumi interrupted us? - Mari asked Tatsuya, hearing this question from Miyuki. Katsuto frowned at the fact that Mari's mannerisms had not changed since First High, but Tatsuya did not care, and he responded with an air of ease.

	 - Yes. Today the first daughter of the Mitsuya family was taken from First High, and there is a possibility that she was abducted. That's what it was about.

	 "Kkidnapped?" - Marie was surprised, slightly rounded eyes. - The youngest daughter of the Mitsuya family, that is, Shiina?

	 - Watanabe-senpai is also familiar with them?

	 - A little familiar through Mayumi. So, this year, Shiina entered First High?

	 - That's right.

	 - Well, what about the kidnapping?

	 Tatsuya briefly retold everything he knew himself.

	 - This is a serious matter! Tatsuya-kun, and Shiba, too, what are you doing here!?

	 Mari seemed incredible that the president of the school board and another important member of the school board do nothing while the student may be involved in something criminal.

	 - In what sense ...? But Tatsuya only smiled crookedly. He was invited here. Although Mari was only one of the participants, but she treated the invited party, and such accusations from her sounded ridiculous.

	 - Shiba. - Katsuto turned to Tatsuya.

	 - What is it?

	 - Can I address you not from the position of the families Juumonji and Yotsuba from the same Ten Master Clans, but as a sempai to the cohais of the same First School?

	 - I do not mind.

	 Immediately after Tatsuya nodded, there was a feeling that Katsuto's massiveness had increased significantly.

	 "Let's postpone this conversation." You should give priority to the first-year student who may have been kidnapped.

	Tatsuya again woke a crooked smile. This time it was more ironic than in the previous one.

	 "Juumonji-senpai, I dare to call you that." In the role of representatives of the Yotsuba family, the daughter of the Saegusa family invited us to this place, indicating that the meeting will be held with the participation of the head of the Juumonji family. In this case, your words about the postponement of the conversation can be regarded no more than the remark of the Juumonji family of the Ten Master Clans.

	 Katsuto could not respond to Tatsuya's words.

	 - "Based on this, neither I nor Miyuki will object if you say that we should postpone this meeting" said Tatsuya and looked at Miyuki. Miyuki's elegant nod-bow became a dumb sign of agreement. "However, it seems to me that there is no point in postponing the meeting."

	 "... What do you mean?"

	 - It is still unknown whether the incident that happened to Mitsuya-san is a crime. Since it is known that she left First High, then, with the authority of the police, after studying the records from the street cameras, you can easily find out where she was taken away.

	 Hearing this, Mari wedged an irritated conversation.

	 "If you know so much, then why did not you do anything?"

	 "It could have happened because of her own will." Tatsuya replied in an indifferent voice. - Yes, Mitsuya-san definitely was taken away. But if she left by her consent, the attempt to save her would be an illegal invasion of her personal space.

	 - This remark is not in the style of Tatsuya-kun, who without further ado, invaded Blanche's base. - Mari objected with obvious sarcasm.

	 However, not only Tatsuya, but Miyuki also did not show an emotional struggle. Because it was obvious to them that Mari's sarcasm was not a logical deduction, but a desperate search for a reason.

	 "At that time, I did not have to check whether I was free or busy. - Tatsuya said in refutation of Mari's words. After that, he looked from the clenched teeth of Mari back to Katsuto. - As students of First High, we cannot do anything publicly. But if you insist that the meeting should be postponed, then we will not protest.

	 Katsuto folded his arms and thought. At that moment the front door opened sharply and noisily.

	 "Shiba-senpai, you're mistaken!"

	 - Kasumi-chan, well, stop!

	 - Kasumi-chan ... Oh, Miyuki-senpai, Shiba-senpai, I'm sincerely very sorry for that!

	Raging Kasumi, Mayumi in a step behind her, and pale and apologetic Izumi.

	 It was the invasion of the three sisters of Saegusa.

	 "Kasumi-chan, in any case, let's go home?" Well?

	 Mayumi tried to calm her younger sister by talking to her like a little girl, but Kasumi's gaze was clearly fixed on Tatsuya.

	 - We cannot ignore it silently! Is it really possible to just sacrifice Shiina?!

	 "Yes, you can," - such an answer did not follow.

	 "So you heard this conversation?" - Instead, Tatsuya answered the question with a question.

	 "I heard it." Overheard! This is bad!? - With a reddened face, Kasumi, in a fit of despair, responded with a defiant tone.

	 "Eavesdropping is bad." - Tatsuya with the usual tone said the obvious.

	 - ...!

	 "But, as you already heard, it will save me time." Shiina is a minor. Even if she wants this, the police can protect her only with the consent of her guardians.

	 "And so what?"

	 - Kasumi-chan. Shiba-senpai says that you turned to the wrong address. - Izumi said, pulling Kasumi by the sleeve.

	 - To the address?

	 "Shiba-senpai means we should talk to Shiina-chan's family, not with him.

	 - To talk about what!?

	 Izumi grabbed Kasumi's right arm.

	 - Let's go. We have already received valuable advice from Shiba-senpai, we should not stop him further.

	 - Right. - Said Mayumi and took Kasumi's left hand.

	 - Izumi? Onee-chan? Hey ... What are you doing !?

	 "Tatsuya-kun, Miyuki-san, I understand that it's rude to say this after I invited you here, but do you mind being finished for today?" I will take care of compensation for this.

	 - Yes, it's good.

	 The existing atmosphere no longer had serious conversations. Tatsuya readily accepted Mayumi's apologies.

	 - Kasumi-chan, let's go.

	 - Okay, we're going.

	 That said Mayumi and Izumi, dragged the silent Kasumi to the exit. Tatsuya and Katsuto exchanged glances and at the same time sighed.

	 "Juumonji-senpai, in that case, please forgive me."

	 After these words, Miyuki, who was silent for most of the time bowed with a serious face, on which there was no shadow of a smile.

	 - You two, I'm sorry that it happened. "Katsuto could only say that." Mari said nothing.

	 Thus, a private conversation between the families of Yotsuba, Juumonji and Saegusa ended without any specific conversations.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	It was almost 18 hours. It was not long before sunset. Erika and Leo left school and now were in the Chiba Dojo.

	 - Erika, I'm sorry for making you wait.

	 While she was questioning the students, Mikihiko came up.

	 "Did you send Mizuki home?"

	 "I led her home." - Responding to Erika, Mikihiko seems to have been a bit embarrassed.

	 - It's clear.

	 However, Erika ignored Mikihiko's sincere reaction.

	 "Erika, what have you got?" Did you find any clues?

	 - At the moment, records from street surveillance cameras are being studied.

	 - Clear. If it is known that the car started from First High, then it can be tracked through the street cameras, even if they used the railroad crossing. And why did I not think about such an obvious thing before?

	 Mikihiko reproached himself for not paying attention. But Erika turned away with an uninterested face. So Leo had to answer.

	 - A proposal to check records from street cameras came from a message from Izumi.

	 "From Izumi-san?" Yes, then there is nothing to be surprised.

	 Mikihiko mentally compared the parameters of Kasumi and Izumi.

	 "I do not know what you thought, but Izumi seems to have received this advice from Tatsuya."

	 - Haha ...

	 Now Mikihiko realized what Erika's behavior was about. Although the fact that this advice was given by Tatsuya, in this case was only Leo's assumption, no one in this place even doubted this.

	 - Sorry, please allow me to pass.

	 At that moment, Saburou came up to them.

	 - Saburou, what is there with the Mitsuya family?

	 From the question of Erika, Saburou's face darkened. In this expression of the person was hidden not only disappointment, but also anger.

	 - ... It seems that both the head-sama and Motoharu-sama still do not consider it necessary to make a big noise.

	 - Motoharu ... this?

	 - The elder brother of Mitsuya-san.

	 Leo and Mikihiko exchanged phrases in a whisper. Saburou did not seem to have heard them.

	 - Strange and somehow ... suspicious!

	 Saburou was confused by his guess.

	 "For the gentlemen of Shiina's family, it seems like not paying attention to her - is common! Allegedly, she does not have a strict injunction to go straight home! It's because she was assigned a real guard instead of me! They do not know where she is, and they tell me "do not fuss," I do not understand this!

	 - Listen, maybe her guards secretly follow her?

	 To Leo's question, Saburou sharply waved his head.

	 "I asked the Yaguruma family." Shiina is still outside their field of vision.

	 Erika's face showed that she was thinking about something, but she did not comment on it aloud.

	 "So, Saburou, what are you going to do now?"

	 "Let me wait here." I came for this.

	 - I see. Then it's good.

	 More and more people were going to the dojo. Soon the training of the evening section for working adults was to begin. Erika's father also had to participate as an instructor.

	 - You three, follow me.

	 Without waiting for an answer, Erika left the dojo.

	 She led them to a small separate building, which was considered Erika's room.

	 - This way.

	 The door that Erika opened opened was less than 170 centimeters high, and the three guys had to duck to enter. It was a room on 4.5 tatami in traditional Japanese style, in the center of which there was a stove in the floor, and in the wall there was a niche with scrolls of calligraphy.

	 - Heh, this is the tea room

	 - It's funny, right? They pretend to be a kenjutsu. Although the traditional kenjutsu and our kenjutsu are completely different things.

	 Erika replied with contempt to the surprise of Leo. And this contempt was not for himself, but for other people. Mikihiko darkened when he saw that her enmity with the family had no sign of relief.

	 - And I thought that the entrance to the tea room should be even smaller.

	 It's unclear whether Leo did not notice this, or pretended not to notice, but he completely ignored Erika's insulting remarks.

	 - A small door? If you want such limitations, try, come in from there.

	 Erika casually pointed to a small sliding door 70 cm high, then retired to the inner sliding wall-door, are located opposite the door through which they entered.

	 - Why stand, take a seat.

	 Erika returned, holding a tray with a teapot and a few cups. Erika slowly sank to her knees and placed cups for 4 people on tatami mats. Three guys sat opposite each of the cups, placed on saucers.

	Under the expectation of what she will say, with the looks of the guys, Erika sipped her tea and raised her head.

	 - What? Or do you want me to hold you a tea ceremony?

	 The three guys waved their heads sharply. Erika, narrowing her eyes slightly, looked at them with her eyes.

	 - I do not want to be engaged in such tiresome things.

	 - Ahaha ... and the truth.

	 There was a sincere apology on Mikihiko's face, but Erika ignored him. After that they sat for a while in silence.

	 Sometime later, Erika suddenly jumped up and ran away with the words "wait a bit", then returned with an armful of pies-manju. After that, all four again spent some time sitting almost motionless. "Almost motionless" meant that there were movements of hands holding pies to the mouth.

	 The further development of events began closer to 8 pm.

	 - Erika-Odzosan. - On the other side of the miniature door the young man's voice was heard. Erika quickly got up, walked over and sat on her knees next to the mini-door and opened it. A small sheet of electronic paper was pulled out from there.

	 Erika took it and went back to the center of the room.

	 "... What's there?" - Mikihiko quietly asked, after waiting for Erika to finish reading.

	 - It was confirmed the place where Shiina was delivered by car.

	 Hearing this, Saburou leaned forward and laid his hands on the tatami. Nobody called him to calm down. Erika, Leo, and Mikihiko fully understood that Saburou was looking forward to the news.

	- It seems that there were no stops and on the way, the car came to Karuizawa.

	 - It's surprisingly far...

	 In Leo's words, the meaning was "it means it would be good if we understood this earlier."

	 - It's better to spend time to get ready for everything possible.

	 This phrase was invested with the sense that it would be difficult to make it possible to use data from surveillance cameras. Hearing Erika's indirect answer, Leo shrugged slightly.

	 Erika turned the sheet of electronic paper so that everyone saw it.

	 - It looks like a western style haunted house.

	 - Miki. When you say this, it does not sound like a joke.

	 Saying this, Erika did not seem to mind the part about "ghosts."

	 - ... Can I get a road map? Saburou looked at the report and looked up and asked Erika.

	 - Good. Just do not think to go there today.



	 - Why !? Saburou shouted fiercely at Erika. For Saburou, who wanted to save Shiina as quickly as possible, these words of Erika were completely unacceptable.

	 - For two reasons. First, we are not yet ready for this.

	 - I'm already ready!

	 "Do you want to go alone?" Stop it. You'd just dig your own grave.

	 Do not "fail," but "dig your own grave." Hearing this, Saburou finally realized that there might be a trap.

	 - And yet, after we finally found it ...!

	 - We cannot say that we found it. We only know that the car brought Shiina to this mansion. We watch the building, and find out if it starts moving on.

	 - ......

	Seeing that Saburou, at last, was silent, Erika voiced a second reason.

	- Secondly, the necessary agreements with the police have not yet been completed. If you yourself do not care that you're jailed, then I do not want to see dumbhead here who neglects the necessary preparations.

	 Having understood the hint of the possibility of being sent to prison for magicians who broke the law, Saburou did not say anything else. Saburou himself would not have regretted losing his life for Shiina. But he could not force his sempai from school to do it. And alone he most likely cannot do anything.

	 "Saburou, go back to your house and discuss this with your family." It would be good to enlist the cooperation of people working for the Mitsuya family. And even in the worst case, do not start acting alone.

	 - ... I understand.

	 Indeed, now it was just this. His actions in the end could bring problems not only to his family, but to the Mitsuya family. Saburou reminded himself again that he was not in a position where one can freely do anything.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	At the same time, Shiina relaxed carelessly, lying in the tub.

	 - Ah ... Saburou-kun, probably, is worried ...

	 Feeling guilty for leaving school, without warning the senpais from the school board and not saying anything to Saburou, always worried Shiina, like a fish bone caught in the throat. Thus, even though the tension was removed by relaxation from the bath, it again and again came to the surface of consciousness.

	 And with this she could not do anything. Because in the school waiting room Tsukasa asked her to keep it a secret that the self-defense forces are engaged in such things.

	 Since these "military exercises" were regarded as military secrets, it is natural that communication was forbidden of it. But she had no idea why they took a high school student for these trainings. But she did not even think about going against the instructions of Tsukasa.

	 Moreover, she could not say that an adult 10 years older than her, whom she admires, can do something bad to her.

	 Justifying herself with this, Shiina, in order not to suffer even more, focused her attention on bathing.

	 Unfortunately, in this western house, in which she was under a kind of "house arrest", there was not a big bathroom like on a hot spring. Instead, there was an antique bath with curved legs.



	 Calculated for large Europeans, it was considerably more spacious than standard Japanese baths. Little Shiina could easily pull her legs in. Thus, she had to worry about not going completely under the water, if you relax your legs.

	 A faint smell, mixed with steam, said that aromatic oils were added to the hot water. It was an aroma that calmed down, slowly penetrating into the depths of the mind. At first, she was tormented by doubts whether it was some sort of narcotic substance, but very quickly she did not care.

	 Needless to say, that while bathing, Shiina took off her headphones, playing the role of ear plugs. Even the sound of water from the shower that was washing her hair was heard for her like the sound of pouring rain, so she had no other choice. Knowing that the magical abilities at this time will be weakened, but while she was washing her hair and body, she used sound-blocking magic.

	 However, while she was just lying in the water, trying not to make too much noise, she could directly encounter the outside world of pure sounds without her "ear plugs". At this time, not only was her acute hearing manifested, but also, according to her subjective opinion, magical perception also became much sharper.

	 All the waves in this Western-style mansion were caught by the "hearing" of Shiina, who was just sitting with her head on her arm, lying on the edge of the bathtub.

	Before the door to the bathroom stood guard, a female soldier. The weak psion waves emanating from it sounded like the noise that a CAD produces in the standby mode. In other words, this female soldier was a war magician.

	 And not only her. Those who moved through the building, both men and women, all kept their CAD in standby mode while being ready for battle.

	 Conversely, among the five people patrolling the building from the outside, there was only one magician. And the psion waves emitted by him, unlike the soldiers inside, were suppressed. Perhaps this was done so that that from the outside it was not clear that there are magicians inside this western-style mansion.

	 ... Such information Shiina was able to draw only from waves scattered in space.

	 And that was not all she noticed. Waves emitted by magicians inside the building carried a clear aggressiveness. It was felt that they were waiting for the enemy. The purpose of their counterattack was not just resistance to the enemy, but his destruction or capture.

	 This fully corresponded to the explanation of Tsukasa about this "work-in-progress".

	 Tsukasa asked Shiina to play the role of an important person in training to save the VIP. In other words, this meant that some main force playing the role of saviors would "come to the rescue" of Shiina.

	 That is, now the kidnapped party is in a state of waiting for the attack of the rescue squad. The treatment of Shiina seemed unsuitable to the concept of a hostage, but here, undoubtedly, the meaning of the words "important person" was reflected.

	 Reflecting on this, Shiina realized something important.

	 Playing the role of a hostage, she did not know when the rescue team would arrive. Maybe right now. She was afraid that if this happened, she could be taken out in this form, only wrapped in a towel.

	 She could no longer relax, sitting in the warm water. Trying not to make too much noise, Shiina got out of the bath.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 At the same time, when Tatsuya and the girls returned home, as if knowing that they had come, the sound of a videophone sounded. The name of the caller - the head of the house of Yotsuba, Maya - was displayed on the screen.

	 Fortunately, they had not yet changed into homewear. Tatsuya exchanged glances with Miyuki and pressed the call acceptance button.

	- Good evening Tatsuya-san, Miyuki-san. Ara, did you go somewhere?

	 Maya spoke in a friendly manner from the screen. Today she also looked friendly.

	 - Yes, we were invited by Saegusa Mayumi-jo. "There was no particular need to hide this, so Tatsuya answered honestly.

	- Ara, then an invitation from the Saegusa family?

	 "Not really." Since the head of the Juumonji family was present, they probably wanted to talk about what happened at the recent meeting.

	- Hu-huh-hu, this is very similar to this young lady.

	 Tatsuya agreed that it was in the style of a good-natured Mayumi.

	 - However, there were some difficulties, and we were forced to cancel the conversation immediately after entering the prepared room.

	- ... I think it was rather impolite, what happened?

	 Tatsuya told Maya the whole story, from the moment of the disappearance of Shiina.

	- The youngest daughter of the Mitsuya family ... This is a very entertaining story, but now we do not have time for it.

	 In other words, it meant that there was some urgent matter. And there's nothing to be surprised about, because when Maya calls them directly something almost always happens. Tatsuya stood still and waited for her next words.

	- It turned out that yesterday, when Tatsuya-san and Miyuki-san were attacked, it was the work of the agents of the USNA army penetrated into the country, which the intelligence department of the national self-defense forces brainwashed.

	 "So this is the work of the intelligence department?"

	 For Tatsuya, who received a warning from Yakumo, this story was only a confirmation, but he could not help but admire the ability of the family to collect information that gathered evidence in just one day.

	- Many USNA Army agents are still under arrest.

	 Tatsuya was interested in what these agents came for. He believed that, with a high probability, their goal was the magician using "Material Burst", that is himself, but he would not even have thought to try to convince himself of this by interrupting Maya.

	- So, I would like Tatsuya-san to release them.

	 "The agents of the American army?" Tatsuya asked, slightly surprised.

	 The intelligence department attacking Miyuki is not forgiven. Sooner or later she was going to let them understand this.

	 But their work was to detain foreign agents who commit illegal activities. It would be bad to interfere with this for the sake of revenge.

	- Among these agents there are Star members.

	 This Tatsuya also assumed. True, he believed that the Stars were almost all of them, and not a few "among them," as was said.

	- Instead of helping them only, it's better to let everyone escape, is not it?

	 - Got it.

	 This meant that there was some connection between Maya and the Stars. And on this route came a request for salvation.

	 Now the interests of the Yotsuba family and Tatsuya's interests in revenge for the attack on Miyuki have united. And since this will benefit Miyuki, the effort will not be wasted.

	 Tatsuya accepted Maya's order, including also his "differences" from the events of the previous evening.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 Early the next morning. Leo, Mikihiko and Saburou arrived in the Chiba family dojo.

	 - Saburou. Have you talked to anyone in your family? - Dressed, Erika went to them and turned to Saburou.

	 - Yes. I was told that I can do whatever I want.

	 - ... That's good.

	 It was like saying that it was useless, but Erika did not care. It was important that Saburou learned to be reasonable for his own interests.

	 - I understand that Leo wanted to participate in the fun, but could not even think that Miki would come too.

	 - My name is Mikihiko. - It seems that he could not just not say this phrase. After his daily complaint to Erika, Mikihiko added a serious voice. "How can I remain indifferent when I'm so drawn into this?"

	 - Ahaha ... What a good-hearted person.

	 "... Call it what you want." It's better than being tough.

	 - Well, maybe. Well, are we going? - Having said this, Erika climbed onto the passenger seat of the police car parked on the road opposite the dojo. Three guys squeezed into the back seat, and the police car started off.

	 "By the way ... is this normal?" - Leo turned to the policeman in uniform, sitting at the wheel.

	 "Was it not because of the irrational behavior of Erika-Odzosan that we had to start so soon?" - Answered the policeman, without changing his face. Leo thought it was not the result of Erika's adoration, but because of the inability to smile. He mentally swore that he would never become like this in his life.





	 The police car reached the Karuizawa station on a road train (it was more economical and faster than even driving at full speed). There they met with the local police. Needless to say, these policemen were also under the auspices of the Chiba family.

	 Leo thought that in fact the Chiba family was more terrible than the Yotsuba family, but he was not so reckless as to voice it.

	 Saburou, who has a direct relationship to all that is happening, did not have time to think about such things.

	 The old building he saw yesterday in a police report. Saburou attached his gaze to this western-style mansion. Or maybe even tried to look inside with the help of some magic.

	 Erika was busy instructing the assembled policemen.

	 Therefore it is natural that the most relaxed of Erika's group, Mikihiko was the first to notice the approach of these girls.

	 - Yes this is Kasumi-san and Izumi-san.

	 Two identical faces turned to the side, from which the unintentional voice of Mikihiko sounded. Haircuts and behavior were completely different, but facial features were exactly the same.

	 - Yoshida-senpai.

	 "And also Chiba-sempai and Saijou-senpai?" And Saburou-kun also came?

	 Saegusa sisters ran up to Mikihiko and the other guys who stood at a distance from the rest of the adults participating in the meeting.

	 - Are you also here for Mitsuya-san?

	 - Yes.

	In their exchange of questions and answers, many unnecessary words were missed, but among them there were those who did not understand what the conversation was about.

	 - It would be foolish if we finally interfere with each other, maybe it will be better to unite? - Said Erika, appearing from behind Mikihiko.

	 - Really. Agreed Izumi. From Kasumi, too, there was no objection. Neither Izumi nor Kasumi doubted that Erika would be honest with them. Those who felt this discomfort, were Leo and Mikihiko.

	 Such reasonable care was not at all in the style of Erika, which they knew. In such cases, last year's Erika, defiantly discarding tactics, preferred simply to go ahead.

	 Now everything was completely different.

	 Both Leo and Mikihiko, both thought that this was, in some way, similar to Tatsuya's way of thinking.

	 Nevertheless, it was senseless to interfere with this. Here, as Erika said, there was a scene in which everyone, in order to avoid friendly fire, should act in an organized manner.

	 Keeping this light puzzlement in mind, the two joined in to discuss tactics.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 When she opened her eyes, it was already light outside. At the same moment, when her consciousness finally awakened, she was overtaken by a stream of unbearable noise. Shiina hurriedly put on her headphones.

	 The abnormal, amplified hearing of Shiina works only when her consciousness is awake. When drowsiness exceeds a certain threshold, sounds become normal. This was the basis of the hypothesis that her excessively sensitive hearing is a magical effect.

	 Evaluating her position, Shiina came to the conclusion that, in the end, she was never "saved" overnight. Tsukasa told her that this "work" would take only half a day, but it looks like the schedule was extended.

	 Shiina was hungry. But not so much that the stomach is already rumbling. Remembering that she could be taken away at any time, she decided to change her school uniform first.

	 In this room, or rather in the private space of Shiina, on the second floor, similar to the room in a luxury hotel, there were separate bathroom, toilet and a wardrobe.

	 Wearing only a dress from the school uniform, she in the dressing room was engaged in what became for her already an everyday morning habit - she did the brushing of her unruly hair. Since there were the same cosmetic accessories that she used to use (although she wondered how they knew this), she quickly did her make-up, having magically checked beforehand whether any harmful substances were mixed.

	 Just at that moment, there was a commotion. From the corridor, there were claps and sounds of the running of people running around.

	 Wanting to find out what is happening there, Shiina pulled at the doorknob. The ancient pen did not fall.

	"Closed !? ... well, yes, that's as it should be."

	 Her reflex surprise lasted only for a moment. Shiina calmed down, remembering that she played the role of a "kidnapped important person." She mentally told herself that everything was all right.

	 Her CAD was not taken from her. She can use magic at any time. If necessary, she can escape, knocking out a window or making a hole in the floor.

	 Her thoughts on such things were evidence that the situation in which she fell into began to seem very suspicious. However, she suppressed suspicion of Tsukasa and decided to continue to consider herself as a "captive princess" for a little while longer.

	"I want to eat ..."

	 With similar thoughts, she distracted herself from the growing tension.

	 - The image from the surveillance cameras is restored!

	 "Is this a special magical assault force?" Why are the police attacking us?

	 The commander of the operation, the lieutenant (this time Tsukasa did not bear the official responsibility for the task), shouted with a misunderstanding on her face.

	 A Special Magical Assault Team, abbreviated SMAT . It was an organization that brought together the military magicians of the police, created as a result of a rethinking of the fact that the police could not adequately react to the incident in Yokohama the year before last. The decision to create it was taken immediately after the incident, but after the signing of the peace treaty with the Great Asian Alliance, protests rushed in from all sides, and as a result, the formation was completed only a month ago, under the influence of the incident in Hakone.

	 Being under the sights of major media, accused by the new non-profit press in "too long in creation", this squad was finally formed. However, despite the attacks from these short-sighted reporters, the morale of the detachment's members was high. And their main feature was that almost all of them were graduates of the Chiba dojo.

	 The lieutenant appointed by the commander of this operation belonged not to the division in which Tsukasa was.

	 He was not informed about the secret details hidden behind this operation. And the details lying on the mind, he did not really understand. The mere fact that this building now has SMAT storming it forced him to now build various assumptions ...

	"... So, that fighter from the Chiba family intervened?"

	 With the thought of "how troublesome ..." Tsukasa sighed. With the use of Shiina as a bait, not only was the appearance of those two (Tatsuya and Miyuki) from the Yotsuba family expected, the calculation also provided for the intervention of the Saegusa family.

	 Tsukasa knew that the "Saegusa twins" loved Shiina and took care of her. That's why she facilitated the departure of the head of the family, Saegusa Koichi, to Kyoto, to an "important conversation" with "important people."

	 As planned, several magicians of the Saegusa family still appeared. This meant that the Saegusa family itself did not interfere in the drafting of the strategy. If only it was not the intervention of the police ... that is, the Chiba family.

	 Despite the fact that the intervention of the Chiba family is a very significant factor, it was not such a serious miscalculation, which would have a fatal threat for this operation.

	But there was another miscalculation, made with the original meaning of this operation.

	"Shiba Tatsuya did not appear ... Did not peck at the bait?"

	 The main miscalculation was that the main goal did not appear.

	"I thought he would be more selfish, but it's more like the middle class than expected."

	 From the school, in which the next head of the Yotsuba family is the president of the school board, the first-grader was kidnapped. Tsukasa assumed that it would be a matter of honor for Tatsuya to come to return her.

	 Based on observations of the day before yesterday's attack on the etiquette school, Tsukasa came to the conclusion that Tatsuya has absolute certainty in his power. If he is this type of person, then for him the honor should be above all. Tsukasa's theory was that the ability to sacrifice his honor, he considers a defect equal to defeat and inherent only to children or the elderly.

	 However, the guy named Shiba Tatsuya, apparently, had a character that was not obsessed with these boring notions of honor. Tsukasa acknowledged her miscalculation. She planned to observe how carefully Tatsuya would handle state forces in the rescue of Shiina. If he did not take into account the lives of the military, she was planning to destroy him as a dangerous man for the country.

	 But, unfortunately, she did not manage to observe whether he would act hostilely or not, knowing that the enemy is the self-defense force.

	 "It's a pity that things usually do not go as they planned ..." Tsukasa muttered in disappointment. Then she went to the commander of the lieutenant.

	 - Commander-dono.

	 "What is it, Sergeant Tooyama?"

	 "Let me, as your subordinate, go to watch our prisoner of war."

	 The term "prisoner of war" had a clear definition of military law.

	 For the military, the use of the word "prisoner of war" in any conditional sense "captive" was not a rare occurrence.

	 In antiquity, even captured horses of the enemy army were recorded as "prisoner of war".

	 It is unlikely that the lieutenant could have thought of anything other than the fact that the "prisoner of war" mentioned by Tsukasa is the girl who is held in this building, that is, Shiina.

	 - I'll authorize it.

	 - Many thanks.

	 Tsukasa wanted to go first to Shiina's room. But she did not plan to stay there. With the permission of the commander, she planned to go to the place where the "prisoners of war" were kept by the agents of the American army. Although in fact they were not considered "prisoners of war" yet. And the rule that illegal agents cannot be considered "prisoners of war" until they themselves recognize them, she decided not to notice.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 - Three minutes before the assault.

	 - I got it. I leave the command on you.

	 "It's an honor for me."

	 Rather the commander of SMAT squad smiled. When he still went to the Chiba dojo, he was the chief of the "Erika's Guard". Recalling the past on this smile, Erika turned away in confusion.

	 There, among the waiting assaults, she noticed that Kasumi and Izumi, surrounded by a group of guardian magicians from the Saegusa family, are straining to look at that mansion.

	 Erika felt that they could not move if they were so nervous, but quickly changed her mind, deciding that this was normal.

	 She had heard it before. These two have their first real battle. Although there was a case of confrontation with helpless activists, but they did not have the opportunity to meet an enemy with equal firepower.

	 Even if they do not study anywhere, but at a magic high school, still high school students usually do not take part in real battles. Only after entering the Military Academy, climbing into the zone of military operations under a hail of bullets - it is very strange for people like them.

	Erika remembered that she herself was involved in the riots immediately after receipt. Then she jokingly said: "I thought high school would be a more boring place." Now she believed that this was not a joke. This time, she did not say it out loud, but thought about it.

	 The Blanche terrorists attack on First High, a sudden attack of the army by the Great Asian Alliance, Parasites and Stars, ancient magic magicians who became pawns in the hands of foreigners. All these incidents were not caused by her, but she was involved in all of them.

	 And the same thing could be said about Tatsuya. So thought Erika.

	 When a major incident occurs, Tatsuya participates in it.

	 Tatsuya participates, she also participates. Together with Tatsuya always comes trouble. And in the end, the family ...

	 - Erika-san, what happened?

	 - Nothing.

	 A member of the SMAT detachment asked Erika in a worried voice, to which she shook her head. It was another, besides the commander, a member of the "Erika's Guard."

	 - By the way, it's almost time, right?

	 - Yes, another 20 ... 15 seconds.

	 You will not lose to evil fate. You will become stronger. But this is useless when only you are strong. Even if you are an angel of death.

	Last summer, one person was involved in similar circumstances. This man is strong. Therefore, being retracted, he remained calm.

	 When you become strong, you start to be less afraid of fate. You become capable of outsmarting the angel of death without causing a tragic outcome.

	 Although Tatsuya attracts misfortunes, he also makes the people involved more powerful. So much so that they with a smile cut their way through these troubles.

	"Therefore, Saburou ... become stronger, so that even if your childhood friend is in trouble, you could cut your way with a smile."

	 Erika mentally turned to the guy who looked like he was trying to restrain himself so as not to break forward, risking his life.

	 A girl named Mitsuya Shiina seemed to Erika born under a star of adventure. Even if not as much as Tatsuya, but still she was like him.

	 So that Shiina will not lose the troubles that can be called upon, Saburou should be made stronger.

	 For Erika, training Saburou was a precedent. Everything was for the sake of retribution.

	 ... The name of the rival who Erika wanted to surprise was "Fate".





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 Shiina turned to hear the sound of the door unlocking. It was not her imagination.

	 - Tsukasa-san.

	 "Shiina-chan, I'm sorry to have detained you longer than expected."

	 - No, this room was quite cozy.

	 - Yes? That's good. Tsukasa smiled at Shiina. There was no sense of guilt in that smile. "Now that we've reached the final stage of the exercise, you need to stay a little longer in this room." There was a small mistake and the schedule was extended, but soon rescuers will arrive in this room, and this will all end.

	 - So, I will no longer be moved anywhere?

	 - Yes.

	 Relief appeared on Shiina's face. She did not doubt Tsukasa's words that she received permission from her parents, she just thought that they would worry if she stayed longer.

	 - I need to return to my post, so we say goodbye.

	 - Ah, good. Thank you for everything.

	 "This is for you, Shiina, thank you in advance for your work."

	 Shiina did not doubt Tsukasa until the very end.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	The battle began between the self-defense forces and the police, between the intelligence department and SMAT.

	 Despite the fact that it was called a battle, the number of participants from both sides was small.

	 Police, conducting a siege, stormed a small number of elite fighters. And the self-defense forces initially allocated a few soldiers to this case.

	 However, the level of preparation for a real battle was higher precisely at the self-defense forces. Both sides attacked the enemy with non-lethal weapons, and in these conditions, the losses of SMAT were higher.

	 - Summoning a sacred wind!

	 - Panzer!

	 The efforts of Leo and Mikihiko were notable among the others. Mikihiko was ruled by the windmills as if he called transparent windmill demonized the barricades with a sledge hammer, while Leo, in the event of a breakthrough of defenses, defended positions, enveloping himself with armor from Fortification magic.

	 - Shiina! Where are you !?

	 Saburou shouted, forgetting about fear and his own safety. Thus, he broke away from Leo and caught a magical attack from one of the military magicians who met them.

	 A soldier dressed in urban area camouflage and bulletproof vest, performing a maneuver under self-acceleration magic, along with this movement magic fired a small metal ball.

	 Having received in a stomach a steel ball the size of a ball for table tennis, Saburou stopped.

	 The military magician pulled out a stun baton. Unlike the batons available on sale, this was a combat model, with the power of a real crushing weapon.

	 Approaching Saburou's head, the club attack was halted by Erika's short sword, which had come from somewhere. The next move she hit the soldier in the face with the side of the blade.

	 It was not a strong blow with a swing, but rather a blow with a whip. From the blow, the soldier did not fall with broken teeth, and he fell not in his side, but straight down.

	 "Saburou, you're too impatient!" From this, you become sloppy!

	 - Got it! Sorry!

	 It seems that the intelligence department decided that a turning point had come here. They concentrated the main forces at the stairs leading to the second floor.

	 The level of magical abilities of the main forces was quite high. Their magical power surpassed SMAT, in which magicians with better fighting power were gathered from among the police.

	 - Mikihiko, you do not feel that there is something wrong with these guys !?

	 "Perhaps they temporarily raised their magical powers with drugs!"

	 It was the feeling of Leo fighting with his fists, and Mikihiko's shooting magic.

	 - Uh, almost knocked!

	 Erika repulsed a short missile with a flying projectile. The enemy was only a few meters away, and the police began to experience difficulties in invoking magic because of these "bullets" arriving from close range.

	 The initial speed of these projectiles was about 200 km / h. But the radius of danger was small, because the projectiles from light alloy quickly slow down. And for the same reason they did not possess a penetrating ability. Catching such a shot at close range, you can get a fracture-level injury, but at a distance of more than 2 meters it will be just bruises and light burns.

	 The problem was precisely in the "burns". At the moment of contact, the projectile shell emitted a high-voltage electric discharge, which hit even through clothing.

	 In other words, it was a kind of wireless taser gun. Both the side of the self-defense forces, and the police, were cautious against the same representatives of the Japanese authorities as they are. Nobody dared to use attacks that could kill the enemy.

	 In such a battle, from the point of view of ease of use, a weapon with which one cannot worry about killing an opponent will show its superiority. Especially from the point of view that when both opposing camps are approximately equal in magical power, then there is a possibility that the outcome of the battle will be determined at the moment when someone can overcome their indecision.

	 And this balance was broken by two fragile girls protected by a group of reliable comrades.

	 - Izumi, our way out!

	 - Yes, Kasumi-chan!

	 Hearing these voices, Erika, Leo and Mikihiko jumped aside.

	 - Three!

	 - Two!

	 - One!

	 - Start!

	Countdown was voiced by two alternating voices. The last joint cry was a signal to activate magic.

	 In the narrow space of the corridor, a violent wind raged. It was assumed that the descending wind would simply surround both enemies and allies, but in fact it turned out that squeezed together in a narrow space, the military and police were densely attacked by the wind from behind and from the side. Only those who managed to instantly lift magical airtight barriers could stand on their feet under the impact of a frantic wind.

	 "Nitrogen Storm".

	 Hypoxia, caused by exposure to air with a markedly increased concentration of nitrogen, neutralized part of the fighting magicians.

	 - Next step! Kasumi shouted. The compound magic of "The Saegusa twins" was a process in which to cast one magic, roles are assigned to construct a sequence of magic and control the interference force in an event. Although their abilities in magic were absolutely equal, most often for the construction of a sequence of magic, Izumi answered, and for controlling the interference force of the event - Kasumi. And also now Kasumi had the right to decide what type of magic will be used further.

	 The choice of Kasumi fell on the magic of "Dry Storm". This magic collected carbon dioxide from the air displaced by the Nitrogen storm to the center of the room, created a hail of dry ice and sent it to the enemy. Airtight shields designed to protect against gases, could not protect from solid dry ice.

	 Thus, at the current moment, all the soldiers of the self-defense forces from among the defenders of this point, were defeated.

	 - Kasumi-chan!

	 - I know!

	 The magic that Izumi asked for, and which was finally called, was called "Oxygen chamber." Translated from English, this "chamber" meant "a closed room, a capsule with oxygen." It was magic for the treatment of hypoxia by creating a zone with increased oxygen concentration.

	 "Yoshida-senpai, Saijou-senpai, please take care of binding the enemy!"

	 Policemen who fell under the "Nitrogen Storm", began to recover and rise.

	 And Leo, Mikihiko and the police, who did not fall into the danger zone, began to link the unconscious soldiers of the self-defense forces, who did not get the curative benefit of the Oxygen Chamber.

	 "What ... happened?"

	Saburou, recovering from the half-fainting state, staggering, hobbled to Erika.

	 - Uwaa, these two insolence do not hold ~

	 - What?

	 - Nothing. - Involuntarily expressing their thoughts about the twins, Erika replied to the interrogated Saburou. "Okay, let's go for Shiina."

	 Leaving the cleanup of the consequences of the police battle, Erika and Saburou went to the second floor.

	 Near the entrance to the room in which it seems Shiina was held, stood a female soldier. Erika pointed her sword at her. A moment before she activated the magic of self-acceleration, a female soldier threw a weapon with built-in CAD on the floor and raised her hands.

	 - ... Are you giving up, or what?

	 Erika did not think that she would be answered.

	 - Yes, I give up. "But this woman soldier easily confirmed Erika's words. - With my surrender, these exercises end with the victory of the rescue party.

	 - What? Exercises?

	 Neither Erika nor Saburou could immediately understand the meaning of these words. The female soldier opened the lock and flung open the door.

	 Still not understanding what was happening, before the mind itself realized the situation, Saburou's body entered the room in search of Shiina.

	 Entering inside, Saburou looked around the room. He heard Shiina's voice before he could notice her.

	 - Saburou-kun!?

	 - Shiina!

	 Saburou walked briskly forward, but then suddenly stopped. His body thoughtlessly tried to hug Shiina. But by force of will he was able to restrain himself. Immediately stop at it did not work, and by inertia he jumped closer.

	 - Saburou-kun, what are you doing here? - Shiina asked, looking at Saburou with her eyes wide open, not hiding surprise.

	 - I came to the rescue! Shiina, are you unhurt? Did they do anything wrong with you?

	 - For help? What for? - In her question it was heard that she was sincerely surprised. But for Saburou, this reaction of Shiina seemed even more incredible.

	 - Really ... brainwashing ...?

	 "Uh, I really do not understand what you're talking about, Saburou-kun." I just helped in the self-defense forces exercises?

	 Saburou vacantly opened his mouth.

	- Exercises ...?

	Muttering aloud what he heard, he continued to stand with his mouth open.

	 Erika turned to the woman soldier, who raised her hands again after opening the door.

	 - Can you explain what's going on here?

	 Erika sent her not only her sword, but also a sharp look.

	 "This is an interrogation of a prisoner of war?" - Said the female soldier in a calm voice.

	 - That's right!

	 "In that case, lower your sword, please." Intimidation of prisoners of war through hints of physical harm is prohibited by military laws.

	 - Oh you! - involuntarily broke out from Erika, but looking into the eyes of a female soldier, she clucked her tongue and lowered her sword.

	 - So it will go down?

	 "Then can I drop my hands?"

	 "... It's good."

	 A female soldier dropped her arms and took a pose at the bar "freely."

	- The theme of these exercises was the rescue of an important person. We were divided into a rescuing and defending side. Initially, in order to win, the rescuing party needed to rescue the person playing the important person of the civil from this mansion and deliver it to a certain place before 18:00 of today. However, due to some problems with the rescue party, the conditions were changed so that the victory will be achieved at the moment the rescue party reaches that room.

	 Erika's left-handed sword was on her head.

	 - What does it mean? Do you want to say that Shiina is the "important person"?

	 - Correct. Mitsuya-sama has been cooperating with us since yesterday.

	 "... But we are not part of the self-defense forces."

	 - We already guessed. But, since there was no notice of the interruption of the exercises, we continued them with you as a rescue party.

	 - ~~~~!

	Without hiding irritation, Erika ruffled her hair.

	"... You can go." I'm not an enemy of self-defense forces, so I do not consider you a prisoner of war.

	 - Thank you, all the best.

	The female soldier saluted Erika and walked briskly away down the corridor. She did not take the weapon, apparently in order to show that she really does not have hostility.

	- No, well, really ... it was an unexpected turn. Erika muttered gloomily.

	- Shiina ... What she said now is true? - Saburou asked Shiina still not believing in the voice.

	 "You mean the doctrine?" It's true. I was asked by Tsukasa-san, and I helped the military.

	 - Tsukasa-san?

	 - Tooyama Tsukasa-san. She is a sergeant from the Intelligence Department of the Self-Defense Forces. Saburou-kun, did not you meet her? She often comes to the Third Lab.

	 - ... I'm hearing her name for the first time.

	 - More important than another! - With an expression on her face, as if she "realized something important," Shiina suddenly jumped closer to Saburou. "Why did you intervene in military exercises !?" You could have been seriously injured! Besides, what will you do if you are arrested, accused of obstructing official state affairs?

	 - We did not interfere with the implementation of state affairs. Said Erika standing next to them.

	 - Chiba-sempai ...

	 Shiina remembered that there was a third party present and blushed with shame.

	 - Even for the self-defense forces, it is unacceptable to arrange such disorders in the city. Since there was no official request for the exercise, the police will arrest those who are involved, so these are the guys.

	 - Ah ... But is not the same judgment applicable to the sempai who also participated in the riots?

	 - No, because we are here in cooperation with the police. By the way, Mitsuya-san, it seems that you know me?

	 Co-operation with the police is not the reason that you can run around the city, waving arms, but there was not a drop of guilt on Erika's indifferent face. And then she suddenly realized that, in fact, this is her first meeting with Shiina.

	"Please, call me without" san. " And, if it is possible, I would be glad if you would call me Shiina. ... Chiba-sempai is well known among first-graders.

	 - I see. Then, Shiina. I'm not trying to protect Saburou, but I think you should not be so reckless to scold him. After all, he thought that Shiina was kidnapped.

	 "Err?" Shiina was petrified. After a few seconds, she woke up, turned to Saburou and asked: - It's true?

	 - Yes! In addition to the Chiba-sempai, Kasumi-san and Izumi-san also came. Mitsuya-senpai and Kitayama-sempai were also very worried ... It was a big mess.

	 - How so ... After all Tsukasa-san said that she will tell everyone who needs it.

	 "I'm not saying that Shiina is to blame." But in any case, it would be worthwhile to tell us about it in advance.

	 "Aw ..." Shiina howled in a thin voice, when she realized what she had said. ... No matter how cute it looked, Erika did not possess the habits of the "older sister" from a women's school that loves "younger sisters", so there was no strange atmosphere.

	 "But because we were so worried about you, you should properly apologize."

	 - Yes. Chiba-sempai, I'm very, very sorry.

	 Shiina bowed sincerely. But Erika was not angry at all.

	 "... No, not in front of me." And before Honoka, Shizuku, Izumi and others.

	 - Okay, I get it.

	 "... It will be quite difficult." - Erika whispered.

	 There was no such feeling of naturalness as Mizuki had. Shiina seemed too incomprehensible, that for Erika it was quite difficult. Luckily, Shiina did not hear Erika's whisper.

	 - Let's talk about something else.

	 - Good.

	 "Shiina, did you mention the intelligence department before?"

	 "Yes, as far as I understand, Tsukasa-san works in the counterintelligence unit of the intelligence department of the national self-defense forces."

	 "Is there something wrong with this?" - with such a question in her eyes Shiina looked at Erika.

	 - Intelligence department, hmm ... No, I do not mean anything.

	 Erika thought that this could be a prejudice against the intelligence department. But she could not deny the aftertaste of understatement in this dubious story.





	CHAPTER 7





	For Katsuto today was the first Sunday in a long time without work for the Ten Master Clans.

	 In the morning he slowly completed his homework from the Magic University, had breakfast, and now relaxed listening to music. Listening to classical analog stereo tracks could be called the only hobby of Katsuto. At the end of the 21st century, analog recordings were an expensive pleasure, but due to constant demand from connoisseurs, they were still released every year, mainly with orchestral music. Katsuto was one of these connoisseurs.

	 Katsuto did not have a special "audio room" with soundproofing or something like that. He felt uncomfortable in an environment with complete blockage from noise. You could say he was a man who, instead of playing in a concert hall, prefers an outdoor concert.

	 Lying on the couch in an open spacious room, he listened to his favorite symphony through a stereo system that looked antiquated, but inside was crammed with modern components that improve the sound quality.

	 Honestly, Katsuto preferred live chamber music and solo, but, unfortunately, he had no time to learn to play himself, nor the time to call the musicians. Not only he, but all the people of the Juumonji family almost did not have free time, spending it on maintaining their bodies in a state corresponding to their title "The Power of a Thousand."

	 - Katsuto, I'm sorry that I'm disturbing you.

	 - Father.

	 The former head of the Juumonji family and Katsuto's father, Juumonji Kazuki entered through the open door. He was only 44 years old. Although he was still too young to retire, he was forced to do so because of the fate that inevitably awaits the carriers of the trump card of the Juumonji family, so he took the chance, and handed over the management of Katsuto's family in the February 2097 Master Clans Conference.

	 - Come Tooyama-dono.

	 - Tooyama-dono?

	 Kazuki called "Tooyama-dono" only the head of the Tooyama family, Tooyama Shinobu. Feeling suspicious, why not Tsukasa, and personally her father, Katsuto stopped the recording and went to the living room.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 Tatsuya arrived at the tip of the peninsula of Boso. From the mountain road, with his "Elemental Sight," he looked at a facility similar to the prison camp, located on the slope opposite. There were magicians in prison who he must now save.

	 Tatsuya received this order from Maya last night. However, Tatsuya left home only this afternoon.

	 He was not going to blindly follow Maya's orders, there was no need for this. But this time he did not sit still for such an emotional reason. Because he did not feel the need to go against Maya's orders.

	 He delayed the departure because he did not know where to go. At the time of their conversation yesterday, neither Maya nor the entire Yotsuba family have yet determined where the captured agents of the USNA Army are being kept.

	 Tatsuya returned to the back of the truck, the driver of which was Hanabishi Hyougo. To his surprise, he had the license to drive large trucks. Hyougo said with a smile that he could legally move any heavy equipment, and it looks like he was not joking. Tatsuya thought he would not be surprised if he could fly a large airplane.

	 Hyougo was also the one who gave him information about this place. On the phone instead of a specific place, instead reported the meeting place, but it seems that it was not done because of possible spying, but that Tatsuya got into the truck in advance.

	 Hyougo was not in the driver's seat, but descended from the cab and waited for Tatsuya. Seeing how he nodded, he quickly turned to the rear of the cargo bay. This cargo compartment in the form of a large box, outwardly looking like simple aluminum, was in fact made of titanium alloy and ceramic composite armored plates. When Hyougo pressed the button on the remote that was held in his hand, a door opened on the back wall of the body and a small ladder moved out of the resulting passageway.

	 - Tatsuya-sama, please.

	 Hyougo invited him to enter the body. It was not dark inside. It seems that it was designed so that the lighting is switched on simultaneously with the descent of the ladder. The space inside the body resembled a research laboratory.

	 There was a black electric motorcycle with a full fairing, and something like a riding suit hung on a hanger on the wall.

	 "It's ... a mobile suit?"

	 "As expected from Tatsuya-sama." You could understand at first sight.

	 Looking not so surprised, Hyougo nodded. Who was surprised here is Tatsuya. He reflexively analyzed the parameters of the suit using Elemental Sight.

	- You were able to accurately reproduce the Mobile Suit of Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion...

	 - Full recreation was impossible. We did our best to add the function of establishing a connection with the CAD assistant in ultra-long targeting, but the power amplifier function had to be sacrificed.

	 Already aware of this Tatsuya was experiencing a slight shock now. This mobile suit, disguised as a normal commercial suit for riding, could connect with the "Third Eye."

	 - However, due to the sacrifice of the power amplifier function, the effectiveness of protection and stealth has become higher compared to the original. I'm sure it's much better than the original suits for Tatsuya-sama, who prefers to act alone.

	 Although the Mobile Suit was the development of a Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion, this did not mean that only national self-defense forces had such technologies.

	 For example, the USNA Army, with a delay of 3 months from the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion, developed the so-called "Pulling Suit", a flying armored suit with characteristics similar to the Mobile Suit.

	 But in the private sector, the first to develop a flying armored suit was the Yotsuba family. Even if you do not pay attention to the fact that flying magic was originally developed in the FLT laboratory under the auspices of the Yotsuba family, this indicated that it has unimaginable technological power.

	 - Also, this motorcycle has the function of establishing a connection with this flying suit.

	 - That is, you can fly on this motorcycle?

	 - That's right.

	 Tatsuya sent a "look" to the motorcycle. The very concept of riding an open bike meant that the rider would not be protected from the sides and from behind. But he realized that the protective properties of the front armor was not inferior to the performance of armored vehicles. The entire motorcycle, including tires, was made of exceptionally strong materials. It was a military model, outwardly disguised as a commercial model of a well-known brand.

	 "Tatsuya-sama, this suit has no name yet." Could Tatsuya-sama come up with a name for him?

	 - No, I, perhaps, refuse.

	 Tatsuya was not touched, but was surprised. As the future wearer of this suit, Tatsuya would be ashamed if the chosen name was not suitable.

	 It was not necessary to ask again that this suit was intended for Tatsuya. This means that the Yotsuba family assumed that an abyss might grow between Tatsuya and the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion. They predicted that in the future it may be impossible to freely use the Mobile Suit.

	 The main weakness of Tatsuya was a weak defense. Even with regeneration, close to invulnerability, in combat you can face a situation where you cannot immediately use "Regrowth". There are also cases when priority should be given to the destruction of the enemy. A highly effective protective suit was an ideal means for Tatsuya to demonstrate his fighting qualities to the maximum.

	 In this costume, unlike the Mobile Suit, you will not feel uncomfortable in the city. Even with a helmet on, he looked just like a little unusual sled suit. And if you throw a jacket over it, even the feeling of conspicuousness disappears completely. This flying suit was made just for Tatsuya. There was no doubt about that.

	 - In that case, you can use the temporary name from the development stage: "Freed Suit". If you ever get a good name, I'd like to hear it.

	 For Tatsuya "Freed Suit" was enough. This probably meant "A suit freed from restrictions". It seemed strange, why not "Suit free from restrictions", but this, apparently, was just a problem of consonance.

	 However, the chatter about what to call it would only cause a series of new questions and answers, which would take time away. Thinking about this, Tatsuya decided to keep silent.

	 The name does not matter. But the benefit of this suit was obvious.

	 Tatsuya refused the phrases like "I accept this with gratitude" and silently began to change into the Freed Suit.

	Unlike the suit, the black motorcycle had a name. It was called Wingless.

	 This meant that he would fly, even without wings. "Someone has a pretty good fantasy," thought Tatsuya.

	 Saddled on "Wingless", he went to the prison where the captured agents were held. On this mission Tatsuya went alone. Hyougo remained in place in the event of an emergency, and according to plan the released agents, will themselves have to steal a car from the prisoners of war parking lot.

	 Lack of support did not bother Tatsuya. From the very beginning, his fighting style had a single action. Although there are no friends who will help in combat, but with it there are no comrades in arms which you need to take care of.

	 You need to think only of yourself. Under such conditions, he can fully demonstrate his combat power.

	 Keeping to the legal speed to avoid unnecessary trouble, he still quickly saw the target building.

	 To check the recently received toy, Tatsuya decided to jump the surrounding prison fence on a black motorcycle.

	 Tooyama Tsukasa left the private residence in Karuizawa for a secret prisoner of war base on the peninsula of Boso, not because she wanted to do something with captive magicians of the American Army. She was just looking for a way to escape from that place. She managed to slip away before Shiina and the plainly not informed military men were interrogated.

	 Prisoners, who did not work brainwashing, were not valuable for Tsukasa. With prolonged constant exposure to drugs and other substances, it is possible that something would have happened. However, there is a high probability that before this magical abilities will be compromised, and the destruction of their personality is likely. There was no hurry in their use, and it was not so inhuman that it was so destructive to human lives. At least, she thought so herself.

	 It is necessary to get rid of the caught agents. Penetrating into a foreign country with an illegal mission, they must be ready for this. Tsukasa thought so.

	 There was no question of liberation. Survivors can disclose the fact that the Japanese army used brain-washed prisoners as puppets. If they are not executed, the probability is high that the facts about experiments on human bodies will surface, which will cause unpleasant consequences.

	 Well, only she alone will be punished for this story, but to put the army, let alone the whole of Japan at a disadvantage was impossible. Because the Tooyama family cannot live without Japan, and "Tooyama Tsukasa" cannot live without Tooyama's family.

	 The matter is not that inaction is evil, the fact is that among people there was a widespread tendency to the appearance of bad thoughts about what would happen if nothing was done. And the more busy a person is, the stronger this inclination is for him.

	 - ... Right. It will be best to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Tsukasa muttered, being alone in this room. It was a rest room for the "jailers", but all the staff were now at their posts.

	 In turn, the room where the captured agents were held was completely airtight. If deadly substances enter the ventilation system through the ventilation system, then the room will immediately turn into a gas chamber. She stood up with the intention to go to the camp director and ask him to carry out the execution.

	 It was at that moment that an alarm sounded.

	 - What could have happened?

	 Although Tsukasa was talking to herself, but the soldier rushing into the room gave her an answer.

	 "Sergeant Tooyama, we have an invasion!" Come forward, please!

	 The wounded soldier was the rank of sergeant. Having made sure that the title is lower than her, Tsukasa asked for the current situation.

	 - What is the scale of the invasion? You cannot answer by security forces?

	 - Only one invader was discovered, but this is a powerful magician! Some guards cannot stop them!

	 "Really?" - the thought in Tsukasa's head rushed past. But she quickly abandoned her "delusion."

	 The Yotsuba family should not benefit from the attack on this camp.

	 - I got it. Where is my outfit?

	 - I brought it with me.

	Tsukasa took the sergeant's dark glasses with an information terminal function built into one of the lenses, and also with a built-in microphone and an earphone in one ear.

	 The glasses displayed information about the coordinates of the offender and the soldiers sent to intercept him. Allied soldiers were within the normal range.

	 "I'm starting support." -Said Tsukasa and activated the Tooyama family magic.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 Having received from the terminal in the security room the data about the place where the captive agents are held, Tatsuya, first of all, just in case, destroyed the ventilation system with "decomposition".

	"What is this place where prisoners are locked in gas chambers?"

	 From the very beginning he did not have good impressions about this place, so he decided that this is an place where illegal experiments are conducted.

	"It looks like I really cannot hold back". Tatsuya muttered in thought. Nevertheless, he did not hold back from the very beginning, because it was an place in the mountains, of which the immediate vicinity was deserted.

	 He pointed the CAD "muzzle" at the security guard who got in his way. His suit was built with a full mind control CAD, but in this battle, he preferred to use a more customary for him CAD, which has the form of a pistol.

	 Specialized CAD custom modification " Silver Horn Trident" instantly derived the activation sequence.

	 Activated for an even shorter moment "Decomposition" pierced the soldier who had tried to intercept him.

	 He did not kill him. However, soldiers, getting holes in the joints of the hands and feet, could not rise, or even crawl. Well, there were no attempts, because they lost consciousness from acute pain shock.

	 There was reinforcements. Tatsuya reflexively tried to attack them.

	 The soldiers who appeared from around the corner of the corridor were surrounded by anti-magic barriers. There was a difference in the strength of the barrier, but the soldiers were exactly the same as the previous ones. Tatsuya decomposed the magic barrier and immediately after that tried to "decompose" the soldier's body.

	 However.

	 Immediately after he decomposed the barrier, it was instantly rebuilt. The soldier counterattacked from a rifle of increased power.

	 Instantly changing the magic, Tatsuya decomposed the bullets and, using the capabilities of the suit to accelerate, left the line of fire. There was no shelter in this corridor. He decomposed part of the ceiling and jumped into the hole. A group of three soldiers followed him.

	 Tatsuya bent over the hole and activated Gram Dispersion. The anti-magic barriers of the three soldiers disappeared. And they were instantly rebuilt. The next moment the barriers disappeared again. And before they were again rebuilt, the magic of Tatsuya's decomposition managed to make holes in the bodies of soldiers.

	 Six barriers destroyed and four holes per person. A total of 18 phenomenon modifications at the same time, which for the current Tatsuya was not difficult.

	 But these altered barriers were just an annoyance.

	"This is not Phalanx"

	 If you think about the regenerating magic barriers, then anyone will remember the famous Phalanx of the Juumonji family. But this magic was not Phalanx.

	 Tatsuya saw Katsuto's Phalanx in action. Therefore, he could draw such a conclusion. The current barrier magic was very similar to the magic of the Juumonji family, but it was still another spell.

	"The only thing that comes to mind is that it's magic from the same Tenth Lab"

	 Descending from the opening in the ceiling, Tatsuya continued to run along the corridor.

	"The Magicians developed in the Tenth Laboratory, is the Tooyama family involved in these events?"

	 The present magic was the same as he had seen the day before yesterday in the course of an attack on the etiquette school. Does this mean that the Tooyama family was secretly pulling strings in that attack too?

	"Maya said not to deal with them ... But if they tried to hurt Miyuki, that's another conversation"

	With the advance into the interior of the building, the frequency of collisions with the guards increased. All the emerging soldiers were surrounded by these magical barriers, but they could no longer stop Tatsuya's advance.

	"This is troublesome magic, but it has good compatibility with me"

	 Calmly assessing the enemy's magic, Tatsuya finally reached the prison zone.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	"Why is my magic ... the magic of the Tooyama family not working!?" - Tsukasa's supportive interceptors cried mentally.

	 The magic of the Tooyama family is the projection of many simultaneous personal magic barriers. This spell, using the body of the person being protected, as a starting point, builds a magic barrier around it.

	 Since the goals of magic are registered in advance, there is no need either for direct observation or for resetting the coordinates. If the abilities of the magic operator allow it, this magic armor can be summoned many times over many people.

	 By itself, this spell is designed to help important people escape. This magic should be used to cover important government figures from bullets and explosions in case the enemy penetrates deep into the country.

	 The Tooyama family is the last line of defense of the central government. That is why, unlike the "last line of the capital's defense," the Juumonji families, they are called "the last line of defense of the central government." The government is understood not as a building, but as people engaged in politics. If you let the people who are at the top of the control apparatus run away, you will still be able to counterattack. Using this concept, the magicians of the Tooyama family were developed.

	 The Tooyama family should only protect important government people. Ordinary citizens are not their goal. Proceeding from this position, the Tooyama family is forbidden to appear on the political scene. It is for this reason that the Tooyama family, having entered the 28 families, never tried to become one of the Ten Master Clans.

	 This magic was developed with such an extremely negative motive that the goal must escape and civilians should be sacrificed, but this does not mean that it cannot be used for such a positive purpose as deterring enemy soldiers. If you activate this magic on targets identified as allies, the soldiers, having received powerful magic protection, superior to their abilities, will be able to concentrate on the attack. Thus, magic protection can be received even by people who are not magicians.

	 The visor, which was now on Tsukasa's head, was intended just for this. It was a technology developed by the Intelligence Department of the National Self-Defense Forces. With the help of this technology, the Tooyama family was able to free themselves from the label "magicians only used for escape."

	 The Tooyama family also wanted to make a positive contribution to the development of the state. Because of this nature of the magic activation, when the point of reference is other people, the Tooyama family has a birth defect in which they equate many other people to themselves, which causes the boundaries of identity to become blurred. More precisely, this defect was deliberately grafted.

	 Nevertheless, they still had a desire to contribute to the organization to which they belong. No, perhaps the desire to help the group was strong precisely because their "individuality" was blurred.

	 And the magicians bearing Tooyama's surname to fulfill this desire were the result of bidding with the Intelligence Department of the National Self-Defense Forces. Tsukasa became the second generation of this treaty. In its second generation, the presence of Tooyama became irreplaceable for the intelligence department.

	 When trying to arrange a sabotage in another country, the detachment will almost always contain magicians. Because magic is a force that can be considered as a military potential, concentrated in the hands of individuals. Therefore, it is inevitable that counterintelligence will require the presence of forces capable of resisting such diversions.

	 With its magic, which allows them to protect with magic barriers even people who are not magicians, the Tooyama's family quickly increased its presence in the counterintelligence unit.

	 Soldiers defending positions counted on the magic of Tsukasa. The realization that her magic cannot help them will seriously reduce their morale. And this can lead to the breakthrough of defensive positions.

	 That's why Tsukasa could not afford an anxious expression.

	 Because of her congenital defect, psychic abilities began to decrease from the feeling of anxiety. But, while retaining the poker face *, she hardly avoided major problems. [From the translator: Using such words is not my whim, but the author's style. I thus conveyed the moment that the author used the English word in the Japanese text.]

	 But, regardless of her zeal ...

	 The results in which the enemy cannot be stopped, could only be called a complete failure.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 The prison, which contained agents of the USNA Army, was in a block surrounded by a spiral corridor.

	 If they were in a separate building, it was faster to penetrate outside. The prison and the surrounding corridor had a structure, as if it were a courtyard inside the building, and in the center of this courtyard was the prison building. Confronting the guards, Tatsuya invaded this yard.

	 However, going so far, there is no longer any need for such stupid things as the straightforward passage of this corridor.

	 Tatsuya aimed Trident at the inner wall. The decomposition magic pierced the wall of the corridor. In the next moment, in all the walls, up to the prison itself, holes appeared of a size sufficient for a person to pass.

	 Then he directed Trident to the ceiling. The splintered pieces of the shattered ceiling crashed into the guards. Tatsuya "saw" that anti-magic barriers immediately switched to anti-object.

	 In this case there will be no victims. But getting out of such a blockage will be problematic. This situation was convenient for Tatsuya.

	 He ran to the prison. From there no one still tried to run out despite the fact that he had already provided them with a passage. It looks like they were in a state in which it's impossible to escape.

	 Tatsuya's guess was confirmed, but it was far from the worst option. The captives were only paralyzed by medical preparations. If, for example, they had cut off their limbs, it would be difficult to get them out of here.

	 He directed his "Elemental Sight" at a drug that paralyzed the bodies of prisoners. Fortunately, they used the same drug on them all.

	 If so, you can manage at once.

	 Tatsuya focused on the concept of the relevant substance and activated decomposition magic. The substance of the drug, which corresponds to this concept, was decomposed at the level of individual chemical elements.

	 Some of these chemical elements were harmful to human bodies, but the main thing now was that the paralysis began to recede.

	 The next woman who came to herself, after a violent cough, passing into vomiting. After waiting for her to catch her breath, Tatsuya turned to her.

	 "Can you stand up?" If you can, then tell your companions. You are released.

	 - I'm in ... order ... This voice, Tatsuya Shiba?

	 Tatsuya frowned inside his helmet. This suit did not have the function of changing the voice, but the face under the helmet was not visible.

	 - Do you know me?

	 It was hard to believe that you can understand only by voice what it is without knowing this person for a long time.

	 "I, ah-oh, I'm a warrant officer, Sylvia Mercury First of the Stars, USNA army." Last year I spent some time in Japan as adjutant of Lina.

	 "Lina's adjutant?" Everything is clear.

	 Tatsuya did not think that she was lying. It is inconceivable that soldiers who are on an illegal mission, would so easily open their personalities. But they must have known that they are already known, like the soldiers of the army of the USNA. If the drugs paralyzed the prisoners, they could also use the appropriate drugs for interrogation.

	 In addition, if she can recognize Tatsuya's voice from several words he said, this only proves that she really worked with Lina.

	 - I was ordered to release you. If this is possible, I would like you to walk on your feet.

	 "It's possible." Now I will tell this to my colleagues.

	 It seems that the nausea has already receded, and Sylvia responded with a firm voice without coughing.





	 Following Tatsuya, they ran from the prison building.

	 Nobody attacked him from the back. As expected, there were no stupid people among the agents of the American Army.

	 It seems that the soldiers who met them were among the last. The cases of resistance on the way back were very rare.

	 Seeing a troops transport truck, they ran to it. It seems that they went through a good training, because by this time, by their running it was clear that they had already recovered.

	 Tatsuya entered coordinates in the truck navigator of the place where Hanabishi Hyougo waits for them.

	 - The place where my assistant is waiting is marked in the navigator. You can escape if you follow this person's directions.

	 After a few hesitations, Sylvia nodded.

	 "... I will not ask about the reasons." In fact, we would not have escaped execution if not for your help, thank you very much.

	Sylvia saluted Tatsuya. Tatsuya responded with the same salute in the army style.

	 As he watched the truck with Silvia's group, Tatsuya returned to the camp building.

	 It was not a problem to escape right now. It is impossible to determine who committed this attack, having only an image of a figure in a riding suit and a darkened helmet. Before exposing himself to Sylvia to prison, he first destroyed surveillance equipment, including hidden microphones.

	 Moreover, studying the structure of the internal premises through the terminal in the security room, as insurance, he recorded the experiments conducted here on people. It was not data from the experiments themselves, but the recording of corpses discarded after use in experiments. Even if they find out that he was the attacker, this data will be enough to negotiate.

	 He returned to the camp in order to erase in advance all the records pointing to him, in order to avoid unnecessary time spent on it in the future. This was not necessary, but it was better to do this in order to avoid subsequent cleanup.

	 He aimed Trident at the top floor of the building. The decomposition magic turned the roof of the buildings management room into dust. Using the function of the flight suit, Tatsuya penetrated the command post from above. In the leadership room, where the roof suddenly disappeared, was the camp director and several staff personnel.

	 ... All of them raised their hands.

	 - We surrender. We are not able to withstand your combat power.

	 Tatsuya nodded and answered in a magically synthesized voice. With the help of Flash Cast, he reproduced the magic on which Sylvia specialized. Possessing a weak interference force, he could not control it at a level where the voice is reproduced in the ears of the target, but he could capture the voice inside the helmet and create air vibrations right next to his face.

	- You will delete all the surveillance system data.

	 Not wanting to test fate, the director immediately replied: "I understand." Tatsuya reached out to the terminal next to him. He did not intend to trouble himself with working on him. He simply cast magic to all information bodies that have electromagnetic properties.

	 Suddenly looking away, he saw the operator looking at him with fear in his eyes. Tatsuya did not react to this and returned his gaze to the commanding captain.

	- Where is the magician of the Tooyama family?

	 - ... Sergeant Tooyama is in the next room.

	 Although for a moment the captain hesitated, he remembered that he was in a position where he could not refuse to answer, and answered in a detached voice. His thoughts for Tatsuya did not matter.

	- Do not follow me. - Tatsuya said and turned off the voice synthesis magic.

	 He took off and looked into the next room from above. Of course, there was already no one there.

	 From the sky, he easily noticed a woman running along the building. This woman fled to the parking lot, from which he recently escorted Sylvia and her people. Tatsuya landed so as to be right in the way of Tsukasa.

	 "Shiba Tatsuya-dono from the Yotsuba family, is it not?" - Suddenly Tsukasa expressed her guess of his name.

	 Tatsuya answered with magic. He removed Tsukasa's magic barrier without raising his Trident.

	 Tatsuya raised his right hand. The Trident took Tsukasa in sight. At this time, the creation and destruction of magic barriers was constantly repeated.

	 Tsukasa, exhausted, fell to her knees. The rate of destruction became much higher than the speed of creation. Tatsuya pulled the trigger.

	 - Stop!

	 It is unclear what was this loud voice, or the appearance of an anti-magic barrier surrounding Tsukasa.

	 The speed of construction and the strength of this barrier were an order of magnitude higher than that of Tsukasa's. The barrier was rebuilt almost immediately after the destruction of the magic of Tatsuya's decomposition. It was repeated again and again, many times. But this event of destruction and creation, repeated dozens of times, actually lasted only 3 seconds, before one person fell from the sky.

	 "I will not let you kill this woman."

	 It was Katsuto jumping off the helicopter. Tatsuya continued to keep Tsukasa in the sight of Trident. Katsuto stood between them.

	"I do not know the circumstances." But you better just leave ...

	 "Shiba," Katsuto's lips moved. But he did not say it aloud.

	 Tatsuya lowered Trident.

	 "I will not attack if you just leave." I promise.

	 Tatsuya silently nodded and turned his back on Katsuto. Not showing any excitement about the attack from Katsuto, he activated flying magic and went to the place where "Wingless" was parked. Shortly thereafter, Katsuto followed the figure of a flying rider on a black motorcycle.



	CHAPTER 8





	A week after the invasion of the illegal prisoner of war camp. Tsukasa came to Katsuto's house.

	 "Katsuto-san, I'm sorry to distract you from your work."

	 At the same time as Katsuto entered the living room, Tsukasa rose and bowed deeply.

	 - Many thanks for that time.

	 - It is not necessary, I have already received enough thanks.

	 You should not bow any more, Katsuto said with such meaning. Tsukasa understood the subtext and raised her head.

	 "Please sit down.

	 Following the words of Katsuto, Tsukasa returned to the sofa.

	 - Are you feeling better already?

	 - Thanks to your help, I have completely recovered.

	 The battle with Tatsuya caused Tsukasa to overload her magic calculation zone. Although there were fears of serious consequences, fortunately, after a week of rest, she returned to normal.

	 - I heard that my father asked for my help last week.

	 - No, your father only reported on the personal struggle between friendly magicians. To stop this is the duty of the Ten Master Clans. Do not worry about it.

	 In fact, this was due to the duty of friendly magicians from the Tenth Lab, but Katsuto adhered to the official version.

	 - Personal struggle ...?

	 Tsukasa had a barely noticeable bitter smile. If you look at it from the attack on the camp, then this is just a one-sided destruction, but if you include Tsukasa in this action, then the matter definitely becomes a personal struggle. Undoubtedly, Katsuto was told about it by her father.

	 - So, that violator, and the truth ...

	 - Tsukasa-san.

	 Katsuto was interrupted by a speech by Tsukasa, who wanted to say "... Shiba Tatsuya-san from the Yotsuba family."

	 "We cannot guess at this." You do not have to talk about it anymore. All right?

	 "... This time, I was saved from a hopeless situation, so I'll follow your words." Tsukasa answered in words with a hidden meaning. But Katsuto did not ponder the search for a dirty trick. - ... Can I just mention one thing that has nothing to do with it? - Taking a short pause, Tsukasa spoke with her usual smile, which does not contain emotions.

	 - What exactly? - In his usual manner, Katsuto asked for an answer without moving an eyebrow.

	 "When I saw that battle a week ago, I was convinced. Katsuto-san. With you, we will defeat him.

	 But even Katsuto could not help but change in these words.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 After dinner, the tea time was approaching. Miyuki was preparing for exams sitting at the table.

	 With her magical abilities, she will never fail the entrance exams. Regardless of the recommendations set for each magic school, she will undoubtedly receive a request from the Magic University with an invitation to attend.

	However, Miyuki intended to do the right thing by passing all the exams. She wanted to get grades for which she would not be ashamed, not only in magical disciplines, but also in the general course disciplines. She believed that if she did not do so, then she could not be a suitable bride to Tatsuya.

	 At the moment when she raised her head with the thought of "it's time to break for tea," the videophone sounded. Before the hand reached the answer button, the signal was interrupted. It seems that Minami in the living room took the call.

	 While she was thinking about who this call could be from, there was a sound of call forwarding.

	 - Minami-chan, who is calling?

	- This is an international call. She introduced herself as Lina-sama.

	 During video redirection, the video signal was not transmitted. But with only one voice it was clear that Minami was puzzled.

	 - ... Connect.

	 Unwittingly, for a moment, Miyuki held her breath. Because Lina's name became a shocking surprise for her.

	 The screen of the videophone showed an image. There was a face resembling that of Miyuki, but contrasting with her, a radiant beauty.

	- Hi, Miyuki. How are you?

	- Lina. You do not seem to have changed at all. But what happened? Isn't it night there now?

	- Yes, almost 23 hours ... But at other times I could not call ... The authorities, on an exception basis, allowed me to secretly call from the headquarters.

	 "I see ... So?" What's your business?

	 Miyuki could understand that such a call is a special exception. She softly asked about the case, feeling that Lina is finding it difficult to start talking about it (or articulate).

	- Um ... is Tatsuya there?

	 - Onii-sama? - Relaxing from the fact that before her a person is not one with whom she usually communicates, she unknowingly called Tatsuya "Onii-sama." "He's not here ... But what's your business with Onii-sama?"

	 It was not a lie. Tatsuya at the moment was in the third development department of FLT.

	- Then, Miyuki, please pass Tatsuya.

	 - Well ... But what exactly?

	 Lina on the screen straightened.

	- Many thanks for that time. Thanks to your help, I have not lost my valuable subordinates and dear friends.

	 Miyuki quickly realized what Lina was talking about. She heard about the incident last week from Tatsuya. She guessed what "friends" Lina said.

	 Miyuki also guessed how difficult it was for Lina the commander-in-chief to make a phone call to a Japanese magician, much less known as the next head of the Yotsuba family. Nevertheless, Miyuki was happy that Lina's feelings forced her to overcome these difficulties in order to express her gratitude for Tatsuya's efforts.

	 "Lina, raise your head." I will definitely pass this on to Onii-sama.

	- Thank you, Miyuki.

	 Miyuki and Lina exchanged glances through the cameras.

	- ... I do not have much time left. Of course, I would like to meet with Tatsuya personally, to thank ...

	 - But in Lina's position, it will be impossible to do this?

	- Hu-hu, and that's right.

	 Lina smiled slightly in response to Miyuki's joke.

	 "... But I'll look forward to meeting you again."

	- ... Me too, Miyuki. I'll see you again.

	 - Yes, before the meeting.

	 And Miyuki and Lina looked at each other, not blinking, until the screen went out.





	 The end of the arc " Prologue of Disturbance."





	AFTERWARD





	 How do you like the 22nd volume of the series, "The Beginning of the Unrest (Part 2)"? Did you like it?

	 In the previous volume, I basically outlined the worsening situation in the world, and the main theme of this volume was a change in the situation around the main character. The reason for a possible bad balance is, most likely, that originally calculated for 1 volume events were eventually divided into 2 parts. Well, it serves us right.

	 The thought-giving end of volume 21 is not associated with this 22 volume, but with the next volume, 23 volumes.

	 Events will move on even faster. Starting with volume 21, events can be considered not "arcs" with pauses between episodes, but one continuing to develop a plot.

	 You could have an impression that in this 22 volume of the place of "hero" and "heroine" the duet of Saburou and Shiina could take, but after 23 volumes they will become ordinary secondary characters. I feel it will be a loss.

	 Along with the Kurob twins, Shiina and Saburou are ideal candidates for the main roles in the side stories, but I do not get to that hand at all. There is a feeling that I have run out of characters. This is a serious problem.

	 At the planning stage of this series, two main themes were highlighted. First, these are the contradictions between those who possess the power of magic, and those who do not possess it. This is the current storyline.

	 And secondly, it is a struggle for the legacy of a prehistoric civilization that used magic as the basis of its entire technology. This story is somewhat reminiscent of the series "Alien" by Kikuchi Hideyuki-sensei, and also by "Spriggan" Minagawa's Ryouji-sensei. But this was not based on a historically authentic "occult" theme, as in the two works. All the legacy and relics were completely invented. We are talking about "antinite" and "relics", often mentioned in the text.

	 Unfortunately, since the series has already reached the stage, when the ultimate goal is visible, from the current moment it will not be possible to insert into the narrative material with the history of prehistoric civilization. If it does, it will be the first story written after Tatsuya and Miyuki are released from school. But at the moment there is no chance for that.



	 So, in the next issue we have a new arch. I'm thinking of calling it "Isolation."

	 Look forward to the next, 23 volumes of the series "The Unkempt Student in the School of Magic."
