Gram dispersion deconstructed the structure of the attack.



(An independent entity.... is it a ‘familiar’ or a naturally occurring ‘evil spirit’?)



In a rare case in the world, an entity with a dense psion structure can arise. Tatsuya had learned this from an Ancient Magician who trained him while he was at the Yotsuba Family house.



Usually, independent information bodies don’t have the ability to intervene with events because they are just a mass of psions, but when that amount exceeds a certain level, they will be able to. The Magician that taught him would also call them God, fearful of calling them a Demon. Using them they developed magic that could change events using an independent information body which now is known as Spirit Magic and Summoning Magic. This is what the Yotsuba magician had taught him.



The independent information body, which had been blocked by Tatsuya, changed directions and attacked again.



Tatsuya realized that there were two things attacking him.



This ‘spirit’ is an independent informational body made up of ‘wind’.



And the other ‘spirit’ is controlled by human will.



(Is it his doing?)



But the hostility of the spirit is far too serious. The attacking power of the independent information body is at the level that it would be deadly for even Tatsuya. Thinking about trying to eliminate the threat in front of him, Tatsuya went in to destroy the ‘wind spirit’ itself. However, he discarded that thought shortly after, without releasing his ‘Decomposition’ magic.



He didn’t stop the battle, because he thought that Yakumo was controlling it.



Instead Tatsuya decided to use Non-Systemic Magic and began to compress psions in his hand.



The compressed psions became a kind of net, with small grids in it.



He threw the ‘net’ at the ‘wind spirit’. It tangled the ‘spirit’ up for just a second and it then tore the net apart.



The spirit that escaped its restraints continued to attack, turning itself into a ‘wind blade’.



Tatsuya quickly jumped to the side.



Red blood flowed from his left arm, and the clothing near his shoulder was ripped open.



The ‘opponent’ is a transparent air blade. Even when he tried to avoid it, he couldn’t do this completely. But it clearly was abundantly powerful and if he hadn’t been wearing his bullet- and shockproof ‘Freed Suit’, his left arm would have been torn off.



But the suit was torn and stained with blood for only a second.



He had already healed from his wounds and his clothing was back to the way it was before the fight. This was the effect of Tatsuya’s ‘Regrowth’.



If he was facing an actual magician, this moment could have created an opening. However, the ‘spirit of the wind’ kept attacking without a moment’s rest. Was this ‘Continued Attacking’ natural for the spirit, or did the operator know about his abilities?



Once again, the wind blade was coming towards him.



He opened his right hand to face the independent information body and formed a shield in front of him.



Hitting the shield of highly compressed psions, the wind spirit was blocked. Giving up on the air blade, the independent information body returned to its original form.



It failed to tear up another part of his ‘Freed Suit’.



Tatsuya closed and squeezed his right hand together.



Psions gathered around the wind spirit.



The independent information body was being surrounded by a psion cloud.



This cloud, which was growing to such an extent that it currently was about the size of a large passenger car, then became the size of a ball that could fit in the palm of his hand.



This spherical ball with a substance that is invisible to the naked eye looked like a crystal ball. The ‘spirit of the wind’ was now confined in it.



He sighed, while making sure that the ‘spirit’ had not left the ball.



Tatsuya began to check his surroundings, but his momentary lapse of attention gave the wind spirit an opportunity.



The moment was almost instantaneous.



It began to release a large amount of pressure, from the inside of the ball.



Tatsuya threw the sphere in his hand straight up.



Lowering his right hand and using his moment to raise his left hand.





The ball burst open. The ‘spirit of the wind’ had exploded itself.



The shock wave created by it went right above Tatsuya’s head and spread throughout the area, making ripples in the sky.



"Are you okay?"



A shadow suddenly emerged behind him. The famous ‘Ninjutsu’, the head Priest of this temple, Kokonoe Yakumo, was applauding and talking to him.



"If you would have payed a little more attention, the ball would have been completed."



"Master, good morning."



"Oh, good morning, Tatsuya-kun."



And he is the adversary whom he visited in search of advice this morning.



"So, why are you visiting your master today, Tatsuya?"



As if nothing had happened, he asked a question as to continue the conversation.



“It’s about what you did just now.”



Yakumo responded with a bitter smile.



"Have you come to learn how to seal parasites?"



"Do you already know the situation about Minoru?"



"I also know that new parasites have appeared in the USNA, which will be more annoying than before."



"Excuse me... so... can you tell me the sealing technique?"



"No, I can’t teach you it."



Yakumo’s ‘playful’ reply, depending on the receiver, could make someone explode out of anger.



"Is that true?"



However, Tatsuya tried to dig deeper.



Although Tatsuya calls Yakumo his ‘Master’, he isn’t one of his students in the art of ‘ninjutsu’. So Tatsuya has always been asking Yakumo for favors. But he has no actual right to learn magic from him.



"Have I taught you anything so far? Previously, you almost had it all by yourself, so I can’t believe you did that well on your first attempt. "



At the same time, he didn’t turn him away.



“Is the ball a thing that is just used to push the independent information body inwards and keep it there?”



“Are you sure you applied the technique properly?”



"So, you can seal a parasite with it?"



"You managed to single out the wind spirit from my technique; I think that is enough to capture the parasites."



Although it depends on Yakumo’s mood, he would advise him on how to train his technique. But considering that he isn’t a student, he should be glad with this much help.



"Then why didn’t you stop when I captured it just now and before it exploded?”



"It doesn’t matter, if we had continued for another ten hours, you wouldn’t have been able to stop the self-destructing."



"Is it because we need more time?"



"No, no, practicing repeatedly isn’t the important thing when training the ball, rather it’s more about the technique itself."



Tatsuya couldn’t ask him for further explanation. Tatsuya and Yakumo have known each other for five years. Tatsuya knew what he was like and also knew that it was impossible to receive any more clues.



"I understand... I will try to invent that myself."



“When you do, try practicing with the help of the second son of the Yoshide family.”



With the amount of knowledge he has gained this morning, Tatsuya was more than satisfied, because it was more than he had expected.



[Four]



"I want to see Miyuki-senpai's face..."



"What are you saying?.. You just met her this afternoon in the Student Council Room."



"But Kasumi-chan, isn’t it better to have tea time together while we just wait here?"



The mansion where Tatsuya and Miyuki lived wasn’t that far from the hospital where Minami was admitted. Quite the distance to walk, but using a car it would take less than 5 minutes. Since she heard that from Minami, she quite often grumbled like that.



"I don't want to go. He’s at the Prez's house."



And that's Kasumi's answer. Somehow, it has become her typical answer.



Both of them were in small restaurant beside Chofu-Aoba Hospital where Minami was being treated. Ever since their role was decided after the last Ten Master Clan conference, the Saegusa have been reserving this restaurant. This restaurant’s business model made it only available for reservation in the first place, so having a temporary base in this restaurant is the most suitable course of action that didn't disrupt its economic activity.



The Saegusa's role was to ambush and capture the parasite, Minoru. In case capturing him proves difficult, they were permitted to execute him instead.



The Ten Master Clans decided that letting a parasite loose in society was a sin and that killing the culprit is something that couldn't be avoided. Both Kasumi and Izumi didn't want to kill him if they could, but they're convinced that if he was to be left like that, killing him is something that couldn't be helped. Tatsuya thought that those two weren't suitable to be a member of the Ten Master Clan’s, but now there is no doubt. They're definitely educated as a Ten Master Clan members.



"Anyway, will he really come?"



They weren't debating the issue of whether to kill Minoru or how to capture him, they had already accepted that this is something unavoidable.



"I think he will."



"Really? ...Even Minoru isn't that foolish."



"I think he is even smarter than Kasumi-chan."



"It's true that Minoru is smarter than me, but Izumi's school rank isn’t much different from mine!"

"Then I don't have to help you with general-study homework anymore, right?"



"W-wait! That's unfair! We're not talking about that!"



"You said that’s unfair..."



"What I wanted to say was even Minoru should be wary about the ambush!"



Kasumi said that before Izumi finished her line.



Izumi chuckled and stopped teasing her twin sister.



"That's obvious. Maybe he even knows that we're staking out here."



Kasumi felt relieved that Izumi stop teasing her with saying "right?" to her.



"Even so, I think Minoru will still come."



"Eh? Why?"



"It's because he’s had a sickly body since childhood. He doesn't have much attachment to things."



"...Right. I remember he often said that he wanted to be more selfish."



Kasumi and Izumi didn't meet Minoru that often. Also, compared to other children they knew, his personality wasn't so attached to things.



From their point of view, Minoru lacked the willfulness of a child.



"With that kind of personality, Minoru even discarded his humanity for Sakurai-san. That intense feeling... Unfortunately, we won't able to understand it. What I can understand is that he definitely won't give up."



"So, Izumi doesn't know it too..."



"Right. As a girl, that's really unfortunate."



"Girl... Yeah, Izumi is a girl but I think that feeling should be the same whether you’re a boy or a girl. Leaving aside feelings matter, the most obvious problem is Sakurai-san is guarded by the Yotsuba, Juumonji, and Saegusa, right? Will he really come despite the enemies? Or is he that blinded by love?"



"Kasumi-chan, being 'blinded by love' isn't like that."



"Eh? Is that so? Isn't it feelings of love that makes one lose their reasoning and common sense?"



"The dictionary indeed worded it like that. To lose reason means to lose the ability to know the opponents' weakness. To lose common sense means to lose the ability to reflect one self’s position with themself, their opponent, and their family in society.”



"Oh, so it's like that."



"What makes me think that Minoru will still come despite knowing about the ambush is not because he's losing himself in a panic.”



"...So, why?”



"Because Minoru-kun definitely..."



Izumi then tried to hide her voice. Not only with her voice volume, but her expression clearly meant "Something that can’t be said loudly."



"He's not scared of the Yotsuba, Juumonji, and Saegusa. That's what I think."



"...Minoru-kun wasn't such an overly-confident person from what I know."



Maybe it was because of Izumi, she also spoke with a low volume voice.



"With his ability, it isn't necessarily overly-confident."



"That's... Well if it's us (the Saegusa family), maybe he could do it."



"The current Minoru-kun, has the parasite’s power. In addition, whether or not it’s true, he even has a mainland ancient magician’s ghost."



"...Isn’t that ghost part too far-fetched?"



"...Anyways."



Even Izumi didn't really believe in the case where he absorbed Zhou Gongjin. She didn't thread down Kasumi's objection.



"I believe Minoru has definitely become stronger.”



But at the same time, she didn't express the necessary things to emphasize their vigilance against Minoru.



In the end, it wasn't clear whether Kasumi agrees or disagrees with Izumi.



"Izumi-chan, Kasumi-chan, he's here!"



The two stopped their discussion the moment Mayumi called out to the both of them.



"What about Sakurai-san?!"



Kasumi asked Mayumi whose voice she heard from the back of gallery-room door about Minami's safety.



It seemed that instead of Izumi, who worked together in Student Council Room, Kasumi was closer to Minami as her classmate. Or maybe, it's that Kasumi was just a simple person.



"It's okay. He will be captured before sneaking into hospital."



"By the Juumonji Family?"



Izumi asked that. But if she didn't ask it, Kasumi would.



"No, by our subordinates."



Kasumi was like ‘good job’ with her facial expression and the light of her eyes. But then she expressed something with her eyebrow after she heard that



“It seems they couldn’t hold their feet for even one second. Currently, the Juumonji Family are moving towards the scene. They should somehow be able to hold him back. They contacted their father but it's taking some time before he's able to come to the scene. Juumonji-kun already notified them but he won't be there for another in 5 minutes."



"In other words, our role is to hold him back, right?"



Kasumi and Izumi weren’t just passively listening to what Mayumi was saying. They were taking out their bracelet CADs and putting them on their wrists, communication-goggle to their eyes, donning protective vests ー with bullet-protection, slash-protection, and impact-mitigation feature protection.



"Preparation complete."



"Me too."



"Okay. Let's go."



Mayumi fully opened the remaining half of the already opened door and went to the scene with Kasumi and Izumi following her.



◇ ◇ ◇



When Mayumi and the twins arrived at the scene, the fighting had already ended.



There were four magicians laying down on the road. Kasumi and Izumi got closer in order to check their pulses and breathing.



"They're alive!"



"This side too. They aren't heavily wounded."



"Where did Minoru-kun go?"



"The last time we saw him, he was heading to the right lane. We were both ordered to protect them here."



The right lane had no gate that lead to hospital. Whether he wanted to break the window or sneak from the rooftop. In any case, Mayumi thought it's obvious that Minoru didn't run away.



"Okay. I'm joining the chase too. You two, please go back to your post."



The two magicians that Mayumi asked were from the Juumonji Family. All the magicians that were lying down on the road were from the Saegusa Family.



"Please do so."



The magicians from the Juumonji Family bowed and went back to the front of the hospital back door. The task that was given to them was to prevent any intrusion. They came here to help the Saegusa Family, but considering their task, their current position was too far from hospital back door.



"Please look after these two."



"Onee-chan, are you going alone?!"



"That's dangerous!"



Kasumi and Izumi wanted to stop their sister, but Mayumi answered with a serious face.



"We can’t just leave injured people here. Even though it's not a critical injury, they are unconscious. Also, there’s no guarantee that Minoru won't come back to hospital back door."



Leading people to believe where he went and then strengthen the least guarded posts. That was a common pattern. Those two couldn't refute what their sister said.



"...Roger that, onee-chan.”



"Onee-sama, please be careful."



"Yeah, you too."



Putting her goggles back on, Mayumi went towards the right lane of the hospital road.



◇ ◇ ◇



A sudden surge of magic is what Mayumi chased after, running along the road leading to hospital.



Lightning sparks flashed through the air.



The distance is about 50 meters. The night sky was filled with a thick cloud, releasing lightning from the darkness.



The target was two magicians. They were people who Juumonji had introduced to her.



One of them was wounded and bled from one of his feet. He crouched to cover the wound.



The other guarded and deployed a magic barrier to defend from the lightning attack.



Usually, the release-type magic would end after being blocked. Modern magic attacked from the starting point to the target’s position in order to make it effective, regardless of the opponent's magic phenomenon rewriting. And it's only for that.



But this lightning wasn't simply just a flow of electricity. It flowed at a slant for several meters, giving off the impression of a snake. It wasn't breaching the magic barrier but crawling around it from the top to the side.



Giving form to the phenomenon. In exchange for using high resource magic by mimicking lifeform movement, it's a technique that also gave the magic a high degree of control. It’s an ancient magic technique which is not available in modern magic. In this case, the dispersed lightning kept being re-used.



It was definitely a high-level technique, but no matter how you looked at it, it seemed more effective to have several lightning strikes. Mayumi, who looked at that moving on top of the magic barrier as if it were a snake, immediately realized that it was just her perception.



The magicians from the Juumonji Family’s magic made the barrier in the form of half-sphere dome. Even as it crawled to the side, it wouldn't breach the barrier. But when she thought the lightning-snake was ineffective, it made a ring on the outer barrier and bit its own tail, fixing itself in that position.



After seeing this, Mayumi finally understood the target of this magic. This magic was to stop them.

Just looking at the effect of the lightning snake, it would be ineffective against a magic barrier. But if the barrier was cancelled, the people who took shelter within it would be immediately attacked by lightning.



The lightning snake seemed to make a ring on top of the barrier but instead, it fixed itself to this position. If the barrier caster wanted to move the barrier around, he would have to fight with the lightning snake.



There was one more lightning attack from the cloud. There was more to it than just the first attack. It continuously made three attacks.



The lightning attacks also took the form of a snake and joined the siege against the Juumonji magicians trapped in the magic barrier.



The magic barrier was tied up with three encirclements. The first lightning snake has disappeared but the consequent attacks dropped to six different positions and entangled themselves to encircle the magic barrier.



Mayumi shot a psion-bullet to lightning's target position.



Mayumi's psion-bullet was just like Tatsuya's Gram Demolition but with less power.



However, her skill for precision when shooting a target is second to none. She lived up to her nickname precisely as the ‘The world’s leading expert at casting remote precision magic’.



Mayumi's psion-bullet precisely got to the position of the established platform. It's the singularity (or discontinuity) caused by long range magic invocation. Mayumi's psion-bullet took down that information body’s structure platform.



Mayumi's magic, other than four systematic and eight types of modern magic, her psion-bullet which classified as non-systematic magic, along with her special inborn sensory magic. Long range visual sensory magic ‘Multiscope’. It's classified as magic, but in Mayumi's case, its ability was an inborn specialty to her. It can also be used as an ‘ESP’ or extrasensory perception, which is a superpower type of magic.



For her, this was an exception. ESP had the same root as magic. However, for many people, wielding magic and ESP at the same time should be impossible. ESP, by just using thoughts to rewrite phenomenon and bend it to its caster's will. In exchange, it's limited to several patterns of phenomenon rewriting. Modern magic has been achieved by adjusting the functions of the mind used from supernatural powers so that they can be applied to a variety of event modifications. But other than using thoughts, it depended on many other factors and steps to invoke magic.



Looking at a similar viewpoint, Tatsuya's ‘Regrowth’ and ‘Decomposition’ are close to superpowers. With the limitation of the inability to invoke other patterns of phenomenon rewriting, it too matched Tatsuya's situation. Just like the explanation of superpower/ESP before, Tatsuya's ability to rewrite phenomenon was limited to things while his inability of phenomenon rewriting versatility fit the description of superpower/ESP holder.



But Mayumi was able to use both. She might be classified as another irregular magician just like Tatsuya.



Mayumi was currently using her ‘Multiscope’ in full power. The information currents that flowed to her from different angles placed a huge burden in her mind. Since the full power usage would make her mind misty, even in just several minutes, she rarely used it like that.

She used it despite knowing the consequences because she believed Minoru was hiding around that area.



No matter the irrelevance of distance when it comes to casting magic, usually it's impossible to have such a high density and high technique lightning attack invoked from afar. He must be around here.



(Found him!)



Did her tenacity yield results?



Or did her strong thoughts show the result.



Within her unique power, ‘Multiscope’, she saw the back of a boy.



She didn't see his face. Even though it was only his back, there's a shadow of someone who was both beautiful and suspicious.



Mayumi moved her viewpoint to see the face for confirmation.



Just when she ‘saw’ the face, whether it's a coincidence or he felt the sight, he turned to the side.



However, that single moment was enough.



Mayumi ran her fingers across her CAD that was on her wrist.



The magic she invoked was the same as her nickname, ‘Magic Sniper’,



She created platforms in the air and from there, invoked bullets of dry ice. (EN: platforms: mid-air gun batteries)



Three platforms which all fired at Minoru.



Using long range sight, she was sure that she got Minoru.



Mayumi then found he wasn't there.



Mayumi's ‘Multiscope’ didn't lose track of Minoru.



He was in the air.



Mayumi created new platforms and invoked dry ice once more.



But the shadow in the air used complicated steps to dodge most of bullets.



Minoru landed on the hospital rooftop.



Mayumi left only the bird-eyes view angle from her ‘Multiscope’, and prepared magic that would capture Minoru as she leapt to a higher floor.



Mayumi left her allies who were still trapped by the lightning-snakes and headed to hospital rooftop.





◇ ◇ ◇



"Will Onee-chan okay?"



"Even if the opponent is Minoru-kun, Onee-sama won't be easily defeated..."



Kasumi asked and Izumi replied without much confidence but regardless, there was no sign of her uneasiness. Voice-volume wise, she wasn't worried.



Currently, the strongest Saegusa magician was probably Mayumi. Their father, Kouichi never really compared their children in term of power so it isn't known for sure. But compared to their brothers, it's proven that Mayumi was the most powerful. Even if Kasumi and Izumi fought together against Mayumi, they still couldn't win. Using their combined power and their trump card, ‘Multiplicative magic’, they still wouldn't be able to win.



They were nonchalantly talking because other than talking and guarding around the area, there wasn’t really anything to do. Their father’s subordinates had their emergency treatment already. After all, they weren’t fatally wounded in the first place. Looking externally, there wasn't any indication that they broke their bones. There’s one who hit his head but there's no brain damage. The part where it's swollen was iced down and instead of seeking treatment from the ambulance, they were waiting for the relief team to arrive. They didn't say it loudly, but if the relief team came too late, they would bring those two to the hospital instead. Both of them were thinking the same thing.



"Anyways, they're still not coming."



"Not coming indeed..."

Soon enough, those two became impatient. It was obvious from Kasumi’s appearance, but Izumi too had a fickle personality. Maybe it was Izumi who often went at her own pace. Whatever it is, they were at their limit as far as patience was concerned.



They both looked at each other to confirm whether or not they had the same thought.

Just like they confirmed with each other, both of them headed to the hospital backdoor together. As they were asked to help carry the injured, at that very time, they shouted a different word.



"Look out!”



Instead, the warning proved to be counterproductive. The two people guarding the backdoor looked at Kasumi and Izumi instead.



They were distracted as magic was casted from the darkness.



Blazing Sparks fell from the sky above. Magic that forcibly draws electrons out in the extreme, ‘Spark’. It seemed like basic release-type magic but required high phenomenon rewriting power. For common magicians, the quality of a spell is usually very low. Having ionization of vapor gas within a fixed volume is the best they could do.



On the other hand, the ‘Spark’ that attacked these two people engulfed them and entirely converted to plasma. Precisely, it engulfed them from chest to foot while their heads were left unharmed. They lost control of their body, convulsed and laid down on ground.



"Who's there?!"



Kasumi shouted that while invoking magic. An intense flare shone through the coiling darkness between the street lights.



She shouted ‘who’ but she was convinced that it was Minoru. If it wasn't Minoru and instead, another person, she wouldn’t have been as surprised to shout like that.



The bright flare that should take away his resistance power, against the flare, but Minoru just narrowed his eyes without covering them with his hand.



The strong light made a shadow of him, which emphasized his inhumane beauty.



"Minoru, stay still!"



Kasumi invoked ‘Freeze Air Bullet’. The air cooled down and compressed, then used as a bullet as it loses its heat.



Like Mayumi's favorite magic, ‘Dry Meteor’, but instead of using carbon dioxide, it was just using air. Although the compound element uses nitrogen and oxygen as the main ingredient to make the freezing point lower than carbon dioxide, the compressed bullet has a different effect than dry ice bullet.



Simultaneously, Izumi deployed zone interference around them for defence.



The flare's light went out and once again, Minoru's body sunk into darkness.



Kasumi's ‘Freeze Air Bullet’ hits a magic barrier and was crushed. The air that was confined using magic expanded, along with a sudden temperature drop by several tens of degrees below freezing.



But that sudden temperature drop also couldn't enter Minoru's magic barrier. The invisibility of the magic barrier was lost when the air became mist and latched onto the magic barrier. It was known then that Minoru's magic barrier had a fixed hardness.



Minoru attacked at the same time that Kasumi's ‘Freeze Air Bullet’ was crushed. The zone interference that Izumi deployed worked. Zone interference wasn't magic. It's a defense technique that uses one’s own phenomenon rewriting power used continuously.



If the enemy casted magic on it, they should have hard time getting past it.



Izumi was using her full power to neutralize Minoru's magic. But her effort was easily overcome.



An electrical discharge was moving through the air. Just like the attack on the Juumonji people, ‘Spark’, however this time the power was toned down due to Izumi's zone interference.



But even so, the enemy's magic wasn’t less dangerous. The spark discharge from plasma attacked Kazumi and Izumi.



Kasumi diverted the plasma as a way to defend themselves from Minoru's attack.



"Izumi, are you okay?!"



Running to Izumi who had lost the battle of zone interference, Kasumi held Izumi.



Izumi grabs Kasumi's hands which held her shoulder.



"Kasumi-chan, we can't do this separately."



"I know, Izumi."



Kasumi didn't misunderstand what Izumi wanted to say.



In this situation, it was 2 vs 1, they weren’t attacking one by one. They're fighting with cooperation.



What Izumi meant wasn't simply a number advantage. They weren’t fighting as two people but rather combining their power into one. Unless they did that, they wouldn't have any chance at defeating Minoru. And Kasumi understood her perfectly.



The twins entangled their fingers. Kasumi's right hand and Izumi's left hand, perfectly matching their palms.



The twins then faced each other as their other hands did the same.



From Kasumi's left hand to Izumi's right hand, psions flowed in.



From Izumi's left hand to Kasumi's right hand, psions flowed in.



From their locked hands, two people’s psions circulated in their bodies.



Minoru invoked magic above the twins.



But Minoru's magic failed. The zone interference around the twins defended them with incomparable strength as opposed to before.



"Get ready.”



Izumi whispered.



"Leave it to me!"



Kasumi answered.



Izumi operated her thought operated CAD on her wrist.



This ‘multiplicative magic’ didn't decide who the main or who the sub is. In many cases, it was Kasumi who invoked magic while Izumi created zone interference. But in this ‘Multiplicative Magic’, even if the roles are reversed, the effect is still the same.



A light source appeared within the darkness. Minoru’s body is illuminated by the light but it isn’t strong enough to blind him. It only served as an illumination.



Minoru made a confused expression. Confused because such magic didn't have any attacking power.



Of course, this was only preparation. It is a procedure that makes it easier for targeting the magic.



Next, magic was invoked. Minoru didn't just stay still but the confusion made his decisions slower. This time, Izumi was faster.



There was sudden gust swirling above Minoru. The air, while keeping it at current temperature, was being compressed in an instant.



Izumi didn't shoot that compressed air at Minoru but released it downward.



Due to adiabatic expansion, the air flowed with a sudden temperature drop and attacked Minoru.



‘Cold Storm’, Izumi created her new magic because of her admiration towards Miyuki and her freezing magic.



"Ouch, so cold!"



"Sorry!"



Izumi answered her with a stiff face. It's because both of them felt the cold. She has only just learned ‘Cold Storm’ so she hadn't perfected the defense for it.



"It's okay. So, did we get him?"



Kasumi didn't have to ask Izumi because Izumi was also looking closely at Minoru.



Minoru, under the light, just stood there.



No movement.



But he didn't go down either.



If he didn't have any more power, it would be strange for him to not have fallen down. If his body became rigid, it's still impossible for him to stand still like that.



"Kasumi-chan, once more!"



At the same time Izumi shouted that, there's a change in Minoru.



The frost that overwhelmed his hair and his shirt suddenly disappeared.



Even with the disappearance of the frost, he was entirely dry.



Minoru stretched his right hand to Izumi.



"Let's go!"



Kasumi shouted that to Izumi impatiently. But unlike before, it's Kasumi who took the initiative. Compound element which consist of 90% nitrogen, blew towards Minoru.



‘Nitrogen Storm’. Magic that reduces oxygen concentration to an extreme and blows the air to induce oxygen-deficiency syndrome.





Minoru defended against ‘Nitrogen Storm’ with his shield and neutralized the downstream draft.



"ーーーー"



Izumi saw Minoru move his lips. Kasumi didn't realize it and because of the downstream,



Izumi didn't hear what he said.



But somehow, Izumi knew that Minoru said ‘This time it’s my turn.’



Izumi felt the sudden magic invocation. At the same time, there was a breeze blowing.



Izumi then impatiently deployed an anti-physical barrier.



The wind stopped at the outer barrier. However, it started blowing again from inside the barrier. There's no way wind could slip the anti-physical barrier. Kasumi and Izumi were already too late when they felt the wind.



Kasumi starts to collapse.



Izumi was shocked and tried to hold Kasumi. She was purposely holding her breath but due to this, she started to inhale again.



After that, Izumi's consciousness was engulfed in darkness.



Before Izumi and Kasumi dropped down on the road, something invisible caught their bodies. With that, they were put down gently on the road.



The one who caught and also made them unconscious was Minoru. Using move-type magic to stop them and weight-type magic to cancel out gravity. Using convergence-type magic to decrease oxygen concentration. This is basically the same as ‘Nitrogen Storm’ that is used by the twins. These two magics weren't used to break through the twin's defense, but he made use of the same type of magic to make it harder for the enemy to recognize the attack. This technique was something he got from Zhou Gongjin.



Minoru increased the oxygen concentration and blew the air into twin's nose. This was a way to forcefully send oxygen into their lungs.



Those two coughed and started to breathe normally again.



Minoru used the following magic. Against the twins, who are now in a half-conscious state and lacked the power to resist, he used ancient magic to make them sleep. Those two closed their eyes. Their breathing was normal which was the opposite from when they were unconscious.



Minoru breathed a sigh of relief after seeing that. He had no intention to harm those two. Even he was reluctant to use offensive magic.



He knew why the Ten Master Clans wanted to catch and subjugate him. But he didn't have any intention to antagonize them into a direct conflict.



All he wanted was to just save Minami. After confirming Minami's will, he would make Minami a parasite if she accepted. And then both of them would hide and live in peace. He would happily return her to the Yotsuba too, if that’s what she wanted. He believed that the Yotsuba would stand to protect their kin, whatever the other clans complained about. That's why, whatever the attack, he wanted to solve it as peacefully as possible. Toward Kasumi and Izumi, who were his childhood friends, he was in distress when it came to attacking them. He wanted to attack them with the least painful attack and defeat them. The pain he caused could be treated simply with an emergency kit and he didn't think that was an acquittal from his guilty feeling.



With the persistent bad after-taste, he headed towards the hospitals backdoor.’

His intention was to kidnap Minami so there's no sugar-coated word for that. Today, he intended to bring her with him regardless of her will. After all, he thought that there was no time to convince her otherwise. He calculated that Tatsuya should already be on his way here.



Minoru stretched his hand to grab the hospital backdoor handle but he suddenly leapt backward a great distance.



Dry ice bullets shot through his afterimage.



"Minoru-kun, surrender!"



Minoru looked above where the voice came from.



"So, the illusion has broken down..."



Minoru whispered that in response. Mayumi was looking down at Minoru from the rooftop of the hospital.





◇ ◇ ◇



Mayumi, who chased after Minoru, jumped up to the rooftop.



She arrived at opposite edge of rooftop.



The moon and stars couldn't be seen because of the dense clouds. From this height, one could see the clouds in the center of the city due to the city lights. With this dimmed light, Minoru could be seen rising upward.



Minoru still had his back to Mayumi.



Even when she emitted psions as a sign for her to attack, Minoru still didn't face her.



"Minoru-kun, stay still! If you don't resist, nothing will happen to you! Your problem, I will listen to you about it!"



Even after Mayumi shouted that, Minoru didn't react. Let alone preparing to attack, he didn't even try to defend.



Mayumi was at a loss. Even she was hesitating to attack a defenseless enemy.



But she couldn't just let this slide. Minoru had become a parasite. She hasn’t confirmed with her own eyes but she didn't believe Tatsuya would lie. She just didn't think Tatsuya had a bad personality, bad enough to lie about this. And a parasite couldn't be left like that.



"Minoru-kun, put down your CAD and raise your hands up!"



Mayumi decided to press Minoru to surrender.



Minoru reacted for the first time. He only moved his body to side and looked at Mayumi. His side face showed a suspicious, wicked and also unworldly beauty smile towards Mayumi.



Correction, not unworldly but inhuman.



Mayumi didn't doubt the fact that Minoru became a parasite.



But this time, she really was convinced that Minoru changed and became an inhuman existence.



She no longer hesitated.



From twelve established platforms, she created them to corner Minoru, and they unleashed dry ice bullets.



Shoulder, chest, stomach, hip, thigh pierced by bullets ー no, they slipped through.



(Illusion!? So this is "Parade"!?)



‘Parade’. Kudou's magic that created a fake existence in the information dimension in order to disorient the enemy's magic attack.



After their role was decided, Mayumi was told about this magic from her father, Kouchi.

Just what she heard, she couldn't really differentiate between real and fake. Mayumi, with ‘Magic Sniper’, saw Minoru from 6 different angles. But there was no difference from all angles.



(If I can't find his real body, then!)



Mayumi's favorite magic was long range precision sniping. If the target couldn't be found, she couldn't use it.



But she's not only ‘The most outstanding long-range precision sniping magic user’ but she also had the ‘Versatile’ nickname, the eldest daughter of Saegusa, the strongest of them.



Mayumi couldn't use a ‘pinpoint’ attack.



(‘Parade’ is magic that creates a phantom in one's position around that area in order to slip through enemy's magic...)



Mayumi heard about ‘Parade’s’ characteristics.



(Then, Minoru's real body should be around this rooftop!)



Mayumi prepared other magic. She used magic one step before it changed to be dry ice, ‘Dry Blizzard’.



Area of effect magic that made carbon dioxide within 3 meters upward and hailed down at negative eighty degrees Celsius.



It covered about two-thirds of the rooftop area. But even with that attack, Minoru didn't show any indication of having been damaged.



However, Mayumi only used that to narrow down her target. Mayumi shrunk her makeshift cage to lock down the vapor gas. It was to prevent the vapor from leaking out.



Within that, the dry ice sublimated instantaneously.



The carbon dioxide concentration was high and it made the temperature several tens below zero degrees Celsius as it covered half of rooftop.



Mayumi gradually let the gas leak while narrowing down the cage. She simultaneously sharpened her mind to that area.



If Minoru was within that area, he would have to defend himself. Even if he could fake his information, he shouldn't be able to fake the singularity created by magic invocation. ーThat's what Mayumi thought.



But the opposite of what she deduced, there was no indication of magic invocation.

In exchange, she found out that familiar powerful magic was invoked on the ground.

The position where the magic was invoked was the hospital backdoor. It was her sisters.



It was Kasumi and Izumi’s ‘multiplicative magic’.



(ーI've been deceived!)



Mayumi finally realized the gimmick. Minoru's real target was to enter from the hospital backdoor. Minoru's illusion was a dummy to make her distance herself from the backdoor.

The illusion feature was a full virtual projection, isolated magic platform, and maybe with magical sense jamming. Without wavelengths from the powerful ‘multiplicative magic’, there's no way to know about that psion isolation wall.



Mayumi left the vapor gas cage as it was and ran to the backdoor of the hospital.



(Kasumi-chan, Izumi-chan!)



Mayumi made an effort to not shout. Kasumi and Izumi were taken down. The worst possible prediction was becoming reality.



But now, her priority was to capture Minoru. At least, if she didn't repel him, her sisters couldn't be treated.



The target was Minoru who held his hand to grab the door handle.



Mayumi secured a large amount of carbon dioxide on the rooftop and shot dry ice bullets.



Minoru leapt back a large distance. Mayumi's attack only hit his afterimage.



"Minoru-kun, surrender!"



As Mayumi shouted that, Minoru looked above.



Minoru didn't answer and he didn't make any sign of obeying Mayumi.



Mayumi didn't hesitate to shoot him with dry ice bullets.



(Again?!)



Her attack passed through Minoru's body and broke down as they hit the ground. This was Parade. Mayumi knew it immediately.



Mayumi compressed carbon dioxide without making it fixed. Ten meters into the air within four directions made a sphere with a diameter of ten meters.



She threw that sphere at Minoru.



As soon as it touched the road surface, the ten-meter air ball expanded in a five-meter radius.



It didn't scatter more than that. Her sisters were outside of its radius. Mayumi didn't forget to make sure of that.



The carbon dioxide concentration was about mid-level poison. If the parasite has the same functionality as a human, then the parasite should have to inhale this air. Minoru shouldn't be able to evade that.



Mayumi made a weak breeze within that half-sphere. It wasn't even at the level of a gentle wind. Its direction wasn't in one direction either. It looked random, but actually, it was a complex regulated weak air draft.



That current stopped at a certain point. At a height of one hundred seventy to one hundred eighty centimeters and at a width of fifty centimeters. About Minoru's size.



Mayumi made the platform within that half-sphere dome and concentrated fire to that point.

Minoru's hidden presence started to appear.



Within the dimmed city’s light, a boy was seen standing there.



Parade was broken.



Mayumi increased the power and density of her shooting. She prepared an abundance of carbon dioxide for the next attacks. The bullets that were previously used sublimated and have become a new resource.



Unexpectedly, Minoru raised his right hand.



Mayumi wondered if it's a sign for surrender.



Within that motion, it couldn't be said it didn't result in some sort of opening.



That's why, Minoru's counter-attack was carried out regardless of Mayumi’s circumstances.



Minoru's illusion that was hit by Mayumi's ‘Dry Blizzard’ already disappeared.



Mayumi didn't look at the disappeared illusion anymore.



That's why she didn't realize that there was large shadow that appeared in its place.



The shadow had four legs.



The neck and head formed, with a narrow tail on its opposite side. That silhouette looked just like a tiger.



Fangs grew from its open mouth and released thunder instead of a roar.



Mayumi was disrupted and looked at it.



The shadow beast that was cladded with thunder was already in front of her.



Mayumi couldn't do anything as the beast pushed her down.



The beast bit Mayumi with its fangs.



Blood didn't gush out from Mayumi's body because she was attacked by an electrical

discharge which made her unconscious.



Mayumi's body, which seemed like it had been snapped, was wobbling.



"Oh no!"



Minoru shouted it.



"Mayumi-san!"



Mayumi's body was falling down.



Minoru was thinking about saving her as he started to invoke gravity control magic in order to catch her.



But before he could deploy his magic, a person caught Mayumi's body as she fell.



Mayumi falling down was completely outside of Minoru's calculation.



He impatiently tried to deploy magic to save Mayumi.



But before he did that, she was saved by a person with an imposing physique.



Mayumi's body was held in mid-air as that person was controlling gravity and inertia to land on the road’s surface without making any noise. That person literally shut out all noise when landing. But in Minoru's mind, he heard it as if the landing made the earth tremble.



"Juumonji-san..."



That person was the current head of Juumonji Family, Juumonji Katsuto.



Katsuto shows his back to Minoru while still holding Mayumi.



He gently put Mayumi's body on the road.



Minoru didn't attack Katsuto from behind. --No, he couldn't.



He was overwhelmed with Katsuto's back as if he wanted to say, ‘Wait a minute.’



Katsuto stood up and turned around.



Minoru activated Parade at once and left only his illusion.



But even if he evaded, it would be meaningless.



An invisible wall came out from Katsuto. With the size of two tatami, about one-point-eight meters in length and width, a hardened transparent magic wall chased Minoru fiercely.

Minoru impatiently leapt to the right.





The wall didn't affect anything except physical objects and it didn't give any influence on physical energy. But because of this ‘solid objects won't be able to pass through this invisible wall’ feature, it's known that illusions don't exist in the physical space. Katsuto's wall broke down Minoru's illusion and grazed Minoru's body as he disappeared into darkness.



Having evaded Katsuto's attack, Minoru prepared for his next magic. By absorbing Zhou Gongjin, Minoru used his newly found magic to mislead direction, Ghost Walker.



At the same time, he ran to the left. If Ghost Walker succeeded, Katsuto would see him running in the opposite direction.



But his magic only worked for two seconds. He was stopped by an anti-physical wall.



(Ghost Walker is not effective?)



Minoru thought that but immediately knew it's his misunderstanding.



Katsuto's magic wall had a width-diameter of four meters and a height of two meters in the form of a dome.



The wall that closed off all directions.

Magic that mislead one’s direction like Ghost Walker became useless.



From above, the wall descended. The cylindrical cover was dropping downward.



Against the pressing magic wall encirclement, Minoru deployed an anti-physical barrier to resist.



Against the wall with a width-diameter of four meters, he focused all of his might on his shield size of fifty centimeters.



Katsuto's wall and Minoru's shield broke simultaneously.



Minoru leapt to escape the ‘cage’.



The moment he landed, his one thigh was pierced. Katsuto, who had the nickname ‘Iron Wall’, attacked Minoru. Katsuto dispersed his power to a wide area wall as Minoru was just barely able to offset the power difference by countering him with a concentrated small area wall/shield. In order to combat such fighting power, Minoru was required to use a great amount of his own magic power.



But Minoru didn't have time to wait for his power to recover.



Katsuto also wasn't so naive to give Minoru a break.



Before the consequent attack came, Minoru already invoked his magic.



‘Cloudless Thunder’.



Among his favorite release-type magic, this magic was the most powerful anti-personnel magic. For the already exhausted Minoru, this magic wasn't something that he should use lightly. In spite of that, any half-hearted attack wouldn't be effective against Katsuto.



A large amount of air molecules was changed to plasma. Then, an electron shower fell towards Katsuto.



But it didn't reach Katsuto.



Just in that small lapse of time, the surge of negative ions were obstructed by a magic barrier.



That was within Minoru's calculation.



It wasn't a bluff. Minoru knew from the start that Cloudless Thunder wouldn't be able to damage Katsuto. This way, Katsuto would stop his continuous attack for a moment and he would then use this opportunity to take the initiative.



(What do you say to this one!)



Minoru took out a talisman ー Commanding Sign, and it started emitting black light from his pocket towards Katsuto.



From Commanding Sign, a black beast with four legs leapt out and attacked Katsuto.



It was a Shadow Beast that Zhou Gongjin used as offensive magic which was arranged to resemble western ancient magic, a ‘Hellhound’. If classified with modern magic, it could be said to be an outer-systematic magic because the damage would come from its fangs and claws which would result in creating the fact of wounding the victim.



(This is an astral-side attack of outer-systematic magic. An Anti-physical shield wouldn't be effective!)



The black compound body was coming to attack Katsuto.



But the jet-black Shadow Beast didn't touch Katsuto's body as it disappeared the moment it touched a magic wall.



(...Juumonji's magic wall contains a feature that not only defends against any physical phenomenon, but also includes one to maintain the original phenomenon.)



Minoru didn't panic with this result and instead, he calmly analyzed it.



Juumonji's magic wall, Phalanx. Instead of the defense power it had, Minoru was warier for its zone interference power.



The caster was able to deny any phenomenon rewriting that occurred within the interference zone.



Illusion and compound bodes too, were magic that projected an image. Without power that overcame Katsuto's power, it wouldn't able to pass through Katsuto's barrier. Even though Minoru had adsorbed Zhou Gongjin's technique and the speed invocation that came with his parasite body, his power was still the same as before. Minoru possessed strong phenomenon rewriting power but unfortunately, it was still not enough to breach Katsuto's barrier.



Minoru scattered his clones and nimbly ran around. This wasn't Parade but just illusion magic. The reason for that was to preserve his power. As Katsuto was distracted, he invoked several magic.



ーSpark, Cloudless Thunder, Plasma Bullet, Hot-wind Blade.



The magic he is most used to.



ーNitrogen Storm, Dry Blizzard.



Using the Saegusa siblings’ magic to surprise Katsuto, Minoru was using various magic’s to attack.



Regardless, all of his attacks couldn't breach Katsuto’s barriers.



And within the small time span in-between those attacks, he deployed offensive type Phalanx.



Not concentrating at one point but instead, scattering to all the phantoms.



One of them successfully hit Minoru.



Offensive type Phalanx was a pinpoint invisible barrier that deployed continuously to attack and breach the enemy defense. If it was only one, it wouldn’t be much different from weight-type magic. Minoru used an anti-physical barrier to offset Katsuto's attack.



Because of the offensive-type Phalanx. He couldn't use Ghost Walker.



Minoru released his shield and at the same time, he invoked acceleration magic.



Katsuto’s attack-type barrier deflects off of Minoru’s body.



Minoru held the pain that almost made him lose consciousness and used the momentum from the impact to fly upward.



Several bones broke, with his internals heavily wounded, Minoru casted anti-gravity magic on himself.



Minoru ascended into the darkness using the momentum.



Despite his wounds, he broke through the low altitude of clouds to escape.





◇ ◇ ◇



Mayumi and the Saegusa twins were taken to the hospital where Minami was. When Miyuki and Tatsuya arrived, Kasumi and Izumi were still asleep. Mayumi had never completely lost consciousness so she was already awake, so she was just lying on her bed and talking, because this was the only thing she was able to do.



"In any case, it seems that no one died."



"I think Minoru didn’t mean to cause any serious harm."



Mayumi had a self deprecating smile when she heard these words.



"...Minoru's goal is to get Minami-chan, he doesn’t want to get in a serious confrontation with us, probably."



"If you had been his opponent, you wouldn’t have lost."



Miyuki’s attempt to comfort her with were matched with a harsh and sad reply.



"Senpai...."



"...Sorry, I wasn’t strong enough."



Mayumi finally seemed to notice that she was venting her own frustration too much.



"No... I think it's not necessarily a bad thing to lose."



Mayumi's face showed that she had a hard time replying to Miyuki.



"...Have you ever lost before Miyuki?"



"...Yes, I have...but..."



"Sorry, I said something odd."



"By the way, is Minoru still being followed?"



Tatsuya decided to change the subject because of the awkward atmosphere.



"Yes, the Juumonji Family is still in pursuit."



Mayumi was glad to be able to say this, so she responded happily to Tatsuya’s question.



"Juumonji-kun said so.."



Mayumi had calmed down a little. She wasn’t being mocked for her defeat and she also didn’t have any regrets.



"In the end, Minoru’s attack.... Katsuto managed to fight him off without getting hit, so we’ll just have to be glad with that."



"Although Juumonji-san’s skills are definitely excellent… I think his fight would have been more difficult if it was just him on his own."



Mayumi raised her head when she heard Miyuki.



"We can assume that after his battle with Kasumi-chan and Izumi-chan, and then with Mayumi-senpai, Minoru-kun was considerably exhausted, and there is no doubt that Juumonji’s fight would have been much more difficult for him.”



“Really... Is that so? Yes, you’re right, Miyuki-san, thank you.”



Mayumi smiled at Miyuki, and Miyuki answered with a small bow.



◇ ◇ ◇



When Kasumi and Izumi woke up, Tatsuya and Miyuki spoke to the both of them before returning home. They didn’t got to see Minami. It was already evening and Minami was sleeping due to exhaustion because of her rehabilitation.



"It seems the twins have gone home."



Looking at the screen of the mobile terminal in the living room, Tatsuya told Miyuki about what he had read.



"It seems to me that if someone would leave the hospital without even staying for one night...isn’t that a bit too fast?"



“Maybe they weren’t able to have a good night’s rest when they know that the Yotsuba ‘own’ the hospital, and not their own Saegusa Family.”



"Well, yes that may be true..."



To that reply, Miyuki gave Tatsuya a bitter smile.



As a result, Tatsuya also started smiling. Perhaps she thought that her ‘reply’ was a ‘failure’.



"By the way, Onii-sama, do you think they would be able to capture Minoru-kun?"



In her consciousness, Miyuki thought that ‘she had to change the topic’. However, even now, Miyuki was still very concerned about the possibility of catching Minoru.



"It will be difficult."



His answer was concise and pessimistic.



This wasn’t because of the power that Minoru has acquired. ─



“The magic that Juumonji uses is suitable for basic protection, which is indicated by his nicknames as ‘the iron wall’ or ‘the Capital’s Final Defense’. Although its power is unparalleled in interception and reflection, it is unsuitable for work that requires tracking and capturing.”



"When you say that, I remember that they weren’t used to track the parasites during the original Vampire situation."



“Everyone has their strong and weak points, don’t they, so maybe Juumonji is better for the actual fight rather than trying to catch him?”



"Oh, Onii-sama, I don’t think they are the same thing."



"...I know you do."



Tatsuya laughed a bit, and Miyuki responded with a smile



“Besides that, what do you think of Minoru.”



The joking smile that Tatsuya had on his face disappeared.



Miyuki also had a subtle expression.



“In order to invade the hospital, he was limited as to not cause any damage to the hospital itself. When you take this policy into consideration, his only possible ways of entering would be the main entrance, the back doors, or to enter from the roof. He would have probably gone through the roof, which Juumonji could have used to lure him into a trap."



“However, when he uses ‘Parade’ and ‘Ghost Walker’, magic that both disguise the user, wouldn’t that have made it difficult to grasp his position?"



“For Juumonji, it isn’t necessary to know where Minoru is exactly.”



"...Huh, what does that mean?"



“The barrier magic that Juumonji uses doesn’t just protect the inside from what happens on the outside, it can also be used as a means to restrict him in- and outside of his barriers.”



Miyuki, holding her hand in front of her mouth, let out an audible ‘Ah’.



“I don’t know the exact details of how big Juumonji can make his barriers, so I don’t know if it can become tens of meters in size. But by predicting his actions and surrounding the area, Minoru wouldn’t be able to escape from his ‘Guard’.”



"So, as long as you know where he is coming from, Juumonji can do it..."



“He can be caught regardless of any magical camouflage that he is using.”



“However, in situations where it is difficult to grasp his location, it would be hard to act as a ‘Guard’.”



"I think so too. So unless my reasoning is wrong, it would be hardly possible to capture Minoru if he is trying to escape.”



When he said those words, he had a bitter smile on his face because he thought of the severity of the situation.



"Of course, the same story goes for me, when he tries to escape using the combination of ‘Parade’ and ‘Ghost Walker’.”



"Is that so...?"



“The quickest way to capture him might be to add extra manpower, as to create an appropriate ‘net’... Maybe the Saegusa Family and the Kudou Family could help us in this endeavor.’



◇ ◇ ◇



"That was difficult..."



He sat down and signed with both relief and regret.



It was only ten minutes ago that he was able to get away from the pursuit unit led by the Juumonji Family.



Because of the healing ability he had gained from the parasite, his wounds had already been cured.



Minoru’s thought that he could have done this on his own, but when he saw Juumonji, he was convinced that he had to ‘run away’.



However, he is currently still being disguised by ‘Parade’. Although it is something that would definitely keep him hidden, he couldn’t be too sure that he had escaped his pursuers. But it also seems like nobody is able to see through his ‘Parade’ using the security cameras.



Nevertheless, despite the fact that he wasn’t completely safe, he felt that he could at least let go of his stress, giving Minoru enough time to look back on today’s failure.



He didn’t intend to underestimate the Ten Master Clans, however, the results from tonight clearly showed that he had. He believed that it was possible for him to take Minami all by himself.



In reality, he couldn’t even make it into the hospital. He was able to take out the three sister of the Saegusa Family, but the head of the Juumonji Family prevented him from getting Minami.



Mayumi, Kasumi and Izumi were not easily defeated. It might have seemed like a crushing victory, because he did it in a relatively short time, but all of them were much stronger than he had anticipated.



Both Kasumi and Izumi shouldn’t have given him such a hard time if they were by themselves. Even if they both faced him together it shouldn’t have been a threat.



But the moment the two used ‘Multiplicative Magic’, it had pushed him into a corner.



Izumi’s magic, ‘Cold Storm’, which made her own body freeze, was enough to make him to lose his sense of security. If the parasite he had absorbed didn’t have a healing ability, then he probably would have been held back at this stage.



Even if he had known about ‘Cold Storm’, and that his opponents were good at this magic, he couldn’t have come up with a counter to it that easily.



Mayumi was even stronger than Kasumi and Izumi. It was completely unexpected that she would be able to defeat his ‘Ghost Walker’.



He had no idea that she was that capable.



And lastly, Juumonji Katsuto. He didn’t know much about him. He was familiar with him because they had shared mere greetings in the past, but that was it.



He really was just like an ‘iron wall’. Even now, when he was looking back on the fight, he didn’t know how he would be able to beat Katsuto.



His fight against the Saegusa sisters before that was no excuse.



Of course, those battles had exhausted him.



However, he predicted that they would come and therefore decided to attack today.



And although he was exhausted after his fight with Mayumi, he wasn’t sure how he would be able to go through that man. He didn’t think that he would lose, but he also didn’t think that he could beat him



(...For me, Tatsuya may be an even stronger opponent...)



The abilities of ‘Phalanx’ completely invalidate any illusions and tricks.



His tactics were limited to ‘fighting him at range’ and ‘attacking him head on’’.



── I can't do this alone.



Minoru was depressed while riding the train back to his hideout.



[Five]



The day after Minoru attacked the hospital, Tatsuya received a call from Maya.



He boarded a VTOL that Hyougo was driving and then through the underground passage which leads to the Main House. When Tatsuya arrived, it was just about to be noon at the Yotsuba Villa.



"We’re here early."



Getting called here early isn’t strange, what is strange is that Maya personally called him and not through a third party.



“In fact, we have received important information from our Pentagon collaborators and I wish to discuss this information with you.”



Even if there were any changed within the USNA, the Pentagon will remain the same as it was.



"I didn’t know that we had any collaborators from within the Pentagon."



Ayako never informed Tatsuya about Colonel Balance. She clearly distinguished her love for Tatsuya from her professional morality as an information gatherer of the Yotsuba Family.



“I will introduce them to Tatsuya in due time.”



Although Tatsuya’s status as being the son of the Family Head was recognized, he still hasn’t been informed of the Yotsuba Family’s dealings.



"That’s okay."



"Yes."



After these words from Maya, they went back to the topic at hand.



"They say STARS have sent out an execution team.”



"Execution, not capture, that seems a bit surprising."



It was almost certain that STARS would send out a tracking team to locate Lina. It has been a week since she has escaped, if anything Tatsuya thought this response time was rather delayed. But for the purpose of the mission to be an assassination, that was

unexpected. Lina is a nationally recognized Strategic Class Magician, and while the USNA has one of the strongest military forces, she is still a valuable asset.



“It wasn’t the Pentagon’s decision.”



“Is STARS using their own authority?”



"That is how it was understood."



“The USNA seems to be having a serious internal conflict, isn't it?”



"Yes, that is correct."



Tatsuya is still unaware of what kind of confrontation it is, but if STARS see Lina as a nuisance, then it is inevitable that they would want to assassinate her for her betrayal. It was clear that Maya had more information about the USNA’s internal affairs but didn’t feel it was necessary to explain it here on the spot.



“Do you know the exact route of their intrusion?”



“If you knew, would you be able to handle it?”



Maya answered Tatsuya’s question with another question.



“If you insist, I will take care of it.”



Tatsuya didn’t hesitate in his reply. Maya couldn’t help but smile when she heard his answer. Both of them would show no hesitation when it comes to murder.



STARS were trying to attempt an illegal act of assassination in Japan, otherwise known as a sovereign state. So on the contrary, if you were to kill them, would they have any right to complain? Perhaps these were Tatsuya’s and Maya’s true thoughts.



“Unfortunately, we have not been able to determine their invasion route, but we know when they will be arriving.”



"What time?"



"This evening."



"...Well, I guess I know why we don’t have the time to investigate."



"That's right."



Tatsuya’s current bitter face was strange, but could be explained by Maya saying these things with an elegant voice and holding her hand in front of her mouth.



“...We aren’t completely prepared. We have set up surveillance and guards at the airports and air force bases, however, making a show out of it might draw unnecessary attention to the situation. Also, we haven’t done anything to prevent them from coming from the sea, because I think them coming this way is unlikely."



“Is there a problem with us being at the airports outside of the Tokyo metropolitan area?”



He quickly pointed out the concern he had and brought it up.



"That's right."



Maya had no intention of tricking me. At the same time, she didn’t give off the impression that she was impressed. I guess it’s natural for me to figure things out to this degree.



"I cannot tell you everything, so let’s just say that if something happens, you will go there immediately."



"Understood."



Tatsuya did not object to this arrangement.



"Well then, do you have anything else you need to know?"



Although this was quite unexpected for her to say, Tatsuya did not panic.



"Should I eliminate them?"



"Normally, this would be okay, but ...I think the government will have a different opinion."



"I understand. I will try to capture as many of them as possible.”



"Yes, please do so."



When Maya rose, it was a sign that she was done with meeting.



Tatsuya got up and bowed to Maya at a 45 degree angle.



◇ ◇ ◇



After escaping from the Juumonji pursuit team led by Katsuto, Minoru got off the train and entered a private café. He waited to see if he was still being pursued or not.



Instead of it being a cafe where he was treated by staff and seeing other guests in the cafe, it was a fully automatized cafe full of service robots. These monitored everything using the cameras in their eye.



However, since Minoru changed his face using magic, he won’t get caught by the cameras. In the first place, trying to avoid cameras in the modern world is near impossible when going to public places.



In addition to offering drinks and snacks, this private cafe also offered access to several network services and limited video software. However, Minoru did not order anything besides drinks.



In order to kill time, he decided to use a device that he had acquired. According to the knowledge gained from Zhou, this device gives the user vague information that can be used to such an extent that it can be used to predict future events. However, getting a perfect prediction is near impossible.



He took a cloth out of his bag that was around his waist.The cloth had five colors on it, green, red, yellow, white and blue.



The device told Minoru a number of abstract words, including ‘good fortune’, ‘south-west’, ‘island, ’‘sky’ and ‘port’.



(The sky and the port could be referring to airports, then if you take ‘south-west’ into account, as well as ‘island’… is it referring to an airport near an island south-west of here? If so, which airport?)



Two airports that came to mind were likely candidates to Minoru. This was just his intuition, not actual solid proof, but he still chose his destination.



The next thing he wanted to know was the ‘time’. The results: ‘Night’ and ‘Today’.



He still had some time to spare but he didn’t have the exact location. So, he decided to make his preparations and headed out early.



Minoru left the cafe and went to a private train that went to the airport.



◇ ◇ ◇



The sun was just setting in Kansai when it was already later than 7 PM.



Had the sky been clear, it would still be faintly light out. However, due to cloud coverage, it became dark fairly quickly.



A direct flights from Los Angeles had just arrived at Kansai International Airport. One man and a boy exited the plane. There were other American Passengers as well but this Anglo-Saxon appearance was quite inconspicuous.



The information that Maya had told Tatsuya was correct. The only mistake was that this was not an execution team but a team sent in advance. A young man wearing dark glasses, well if you looked closely you could see that he had a prosthetic eye. This was Lieutenant Jacob Regulus. The only person sent from STARS.



Raymond Clark was the boy who was with him. This visit wasn’t an order given to him by his father. It was decided through ‘discussion’ with the parasites.



Raymond became a parasite with a distorted obsession to bring Tatsuya down. With that strong desire, he took the initiative of ordering the parasites to assassinate Tatsuya.



"It seems that there is a train station."



Raymond, who used a fake passport to get through customs and had arrived in the lobby, pointed this out to him.



("Do you want to use the train?")



Regulus asked this through telepathy.



"You idiot!"



Raymond warned him by actually speaking to stop him from using telepathy.



"Oh, I'm sorry."



Regulus apologized to Raymond.



By using telepathy, you don’t have to worry about microphones on audio capturing devices. But on the other hand, you run the risk of magicians or other ‘supernatural beings’ being able to notice you.



A microphone has a limited effective distance. If you know who you are looking, you can catch their voice even if they are far away if you filter the sound by the voice you’re searching for. But if you don’t know who you’re looking for, it’s impossible.



On the other hand, telepathy has no restrictions in terms of distance. The extent to which a person can catch it depends on their ability, but it is technically the same as magic in which it is not bound by physical distance.



But the number of people that can talk telepathically is very small, and it would be very easy to pick up on their true identity if they continued to speak this way.



So before they left the USNA, they had a talk and decided not to use telepathy. However, telepathy is a natural form of communication for parasites. He had accidentally used telepathy because he wanted to speak to Raymond. So he was definitely in the wrong.



And their lack of vigilance was caught.



◇ ◇ ◇



“This is the police force at the Kansai Airport. We have just caught a telepathic transmission. It appears that the likely suspects are the ones that have just arrived from the USNA”



One of the magicians that belonged to the police force, Kurosawa, that came to support the airport’s security detected Regulus’ telepathy and had immediately made a request to the command center.



"Could you please confirm this... The magician you are speaking of is not included in the passenger registry. It could be that he used a fake passport. Kurosawa, could you describe the individual?"



“There are two people. One twenty-year-old man and an adolescent boy. Both white. The man is wearing sunglasses and has gray hair. The boy has blond hair. The person using the telepathy was the gray-haired individual. It also seems like they are heading for the train platform."



“Understood. Please keep watching them and don’t lose sight of them. Also, please try to take a picture of them to confirm their identity.”



"OK."



◇ ◇ ◇



"Raymond, we are being followed by the police.”



"What!?"



Regulus was the first to notice that they were being tailed.



It would seem that an undercover policeman is following them, but Raymond wasn’t able to notice because he wasn’t familiar with investigation and being chased.



"Sorry, I think my use of telepathy screwed us."



However, Regulus is an elite magician form the USNA’s STARS. Moreover, he is a sniper, which requires good observation skills that can be used during a mission. So he was able to quickly determine that they were being followed.



"What do we do, Ray?"



"We have nothing to work with, so our options are limited."



"True. Even we couldn’t have sneaked weapons with us."

Even if he was from STARS, he wasn’t arrogant enough to think that he could take a weapon into another country. So being unarmed, the only thing they could do was to go the USNA’s embassy here in Tokyo.



"Do you have your passport on you?"



"I do."



Raymond answered Regulus' question with a hesitating voice.



"Fine, let’s run for it!"



They left their suitcases behind.



◇ ◇ ◇



“Two people who we suspect to be illegally immigrated magicians have left their suitcases and have started to flee.”



The policemen informed Kurosawa.



The policemen who were monitoring the two people did this using a communication device.



"Track them. Send me a photo of their luggage. Then bring it here.”



"Understood".



The policeman controlling the information terminal during this operation sent a photograph of the suitcase to be used as evidence.



“Data collected.”



"Permission to use magic while in pursuit."



“Granted.”



As soon as they heard these words, the policemen were in hot pursuit.



◇ ◇ ◇



"Stop right there!"



An uniformed police officer jumped through the air and was quickly approaching them.



Regulus, who had noticed first, warned Raymond.



"Are you out of your mind?"



Why does this Japanese officer make such a flashy move in the middle of a big crowd of civilians! This was a completely unexpected event for Regulus.



It is rare for this movie-like scene to play out, especially since Japan and the USNA have similar standards that includes using magic as inconspicuously as possible while in public, on the grounds that it might have a psychological effect on them.



But this situation was difficult to circumvent, even if it had been known in advance.



Raymond was making gestures to the policeman.



The policeman was suddenly blown away. This was due to Raymond’s power of psychokinesis which he obtained after becoming a parasite.



"Raymond!"



"There is no way around it!"



Regulus stopped blaming him.



Of course, they didn’t have a choice, so was this the only thing they could do?



They had disguised themselves as immigrants as to hide their ability to use magic and so they could enter the country without any problems.



There was signs of magic activation. It seems that the policeman, who they had thought they had gotten rid off, was already back. What’s more, there were signs of other people that were ready to capture them. This was probably the support sent by the police.



He turned around. He had never thought that their first step to invading Japan would be like this. The airport is in a metropolitan area. They had chosen this airport because they wouldn’t stand out as much here. However, them being caught was his mistake, but even then who could have expected that it would come to this.



We hadn’t asked for support from our local collaborators, we were reckless, to think we could enter this country so easily.



Such regret went through Regulus' mind.



However, this wasn’t the time to think about this.



"Raymond, I’m going to go through the encirclement."



Regulus used self-acceleration magic and made a dash through the crowd.



Raymond followed him closely behind him using the same magic.



They arrived at a taxi, which could also be used as a guide.



"Steal the taxi."



"Alright!"



Raymond responded positively to Regulus’ instructions.



Regulus was already ready for battle. He was a First-Class magician that belonged to STARS, the strongest magical unit in the world. So he wasn’t afraid of the cops. Raymond was neither a soldier nor a police officer, but he is simply someone ‘who isn’t afraid’, which also works in the current situation.



They had quickly decided to take the taxi, while also expecting some resistance from the driver.



However, when they looked back at the taxi, it had turned into a large, luxury, black passenger car. It seems that it had been disguised.



("Get in!")



Raymond and Regulus look at each other. The voice now was broadcasted telepathically, as it became evident that it was from another parasite.



Raymond followed Regulus.



Regulus rushed to the black car and opened the back door.



Raymond opened the passenger door.



When the two entered, the large sedan immediately started driving.



A strong magic was covering the entire self-propelled car.



"Is this.. ‘Parade’?"



Regulus muttered in telepathy.



"Yes, but please refrain from using telepathy."



Regulus stared at the back of a boy who was sitting in front of him.



And then he became surprised.



He almost forgot to breathe.



He had never dreamed that such a beautiful boy really existed.



If we’re just talking about beauty, his face wouldn’t lose to that of Angie Sirius - Lina.



However, Lina’s beauty exudes a sort of friendliness that is easy to approach while this boy gave off the impression of being difficult to approach.



But the beauty of this person wasn’t that of a simple boy, but of a model-like man.



He wondered if angels could even have such beauty… Regulus also wondered if he was daydreaming too much.



"There is a possibility that we can’t complete disguise our telepathy."



The boy didn’t seem to care about Regulus’ piercing gaze and continued on. He was probably used to being looked at like that.



“Oh, I'm sorry, you’ve saved us, thank you.”



They slightly lowered their head, while sitting.



“My name is Jacob Regulus."



He noticed that he hadn’t introduced himself and did this in a panic. I noticed that I did not introduce myself, and in a panic I gave him a taste.



"My name is Kudou Minoru."



"I'm Raymond Clark."



Raymond was looking around and decided to join in on the conversation.



"The Kudou, as in the Kudou from the Ten Master Clans? "



Raymond was quite knowledgeable thanks to Hliðskjálf.



"Yes, and you are a member of the ‘Clarks’ that are responsible for the Dione Project?"



"Yes, yes... I’m that Raymond."



"Okay... by the way, do you have somewhere you want me to take you?"



When Minoru mentioned this, Regulus was knitting his brows.



"... The police have probably gone to the hotel we booked."



"Well, both of your passports are useless now."



Regulus showed a surprised face, he had already thought that they had been photographed and that their fake passports had become invalid. However, he couldn’t believe someone else would have already thought about the same thing.



“Should I prepare a place to stay and a new passports for you guys? Of course they would show your American citizenship and when you entered the country.”



To Minoru’s proposal, Regulus was more vigilant than ‘grateful’.



"I thank you for saving us, but why are you trying to help us?"



To ask Regulus’ question, Minoru had a cold, but happy smile on his face.



"Because I am one of you."



Regulus had considered this as well. However, he didn’t think this was the only reason.



“Besides, there is something that I want you to help me with.”



"I'm sorry, what?"



Raymond wasn’t as vigilant as Regulus.



For a parasite, Raymond thought that this was strange. Parasites are all pieces of the same consciousness, because of this, they also have the same goal. So it is impossible to have different thoughts that vary from the general consensus.



"There is a girl that ‘I want to be with’.”





"A lover?"



It was as if Raymond’s eyes started to shine when he heard this topic.



“No, it currently is only one-sided… I don’t plan to forcibly take her. So I will give up if she doesn’t want me.”



"Wow.... You’re pretty patient, huh... I can respect that."



When it came to Minoru, Regulus was somewhat skeptical.



The idea of ​​abandoning a companion is one of the primary instincts of a parasite. So this was more like the human mentality than that of his own.



Furthermore, Regulus wasn’t able to read his thoughts or feelings like he could do normally with the other parasites.



There is no doubt that Minoru is a parasite, that goes without question.



However, Minoru is clearly different from us



To Regulus, this was something he was sure of.



◇ ◇ ◇



The illegal immigrants using telepathy broke through the police siege and fled the scene. It was reported to the Futatsugi Family through the police, and this information was shared to the Ten Master Clans.



"Was it at Kansai?"



In the middle of the night, just before the date was going to change, Tatsuya received a phone call from the Main House.



"Yes. The Kuroba Family has taken charge of the search. So you can go about your normal duties in Tokyo and Miyaki Island as usual.”



“If the illegal immigrants are from STARS, they will probably be targeting Lina. Okay, I understand."



“We will send you the photographs of the immigrants that the police made. One of the suspects is Raymond Clark. "



That was surprising



"What does Raymond Clark have to do with it?"



"It hasn’t been confirmed yet, but from the psion observation data that we have obtained, it seems like Raymond Clark is a parasite."



“Have you been able to discern the parasites using a radar?”



“This is the result of our research.”



“Of course, it is thanks to Tatsuya-san that we were able to obtain the parasite that we use in our experiments.”



After the ‘Vampire Incident’, in last February, he had managed to seal a parasite during the Steeplechase event and had handed it over to the Yotsuba. Tatsuya thought that this situation was rather ironic, but didn’t mention it.



Besides, for Tatsuya, there is no reason to say this. In the end, all that matters is that they managed to develop a way to track the parasites.



"Can’t you find Minoru using this method?"



“We are adjusting the radar that Kurebayashi created for Kudou Minoru. Please wait a little longer."



Kurebayashi is the third butler of the Yotsuba Family and is the general manager of the Yotsuba Family’s technical department. He is also an excellent magician and was one of Tatsuya’s first teachers who taught him about magical engineering.



"I understand, I expect nothing less from you."



“Your words are too much for me. By the way, has Major Sirius been doing well?"



"It seems that she hasn’t gotten bored yet."



"Is that so. If she requires anything, let me know and I shall take care of it."



"I'll tell Lina that."



"Goodbye."



After that simple goodbye was said, the screen got dark.



He wasn’t in the living room, but in his own room. It was early in the morning so Miyuki was still in bed.



He was the only one that was relevant to the situation, so Miyuki didn’t need to be there. Instead he was thinking about speaking with Ayako.



Thinking about it, the other immigrant must have been someone that belongs to STARS.



So it is natural, that given the distribution of the roles in the Yotsuba Family. It is likely that Ayako will become involved in the situation.



Both Ayaka and Fumiya are good at information gathering. But unlike him, they still have to attend school. However, if they were to choose, he felt that the mission would be given priority over school.



It didn’t really matter if they came for Tatsuya. His ‘Elemental sight’ is a magic that goes along perfectly with searching. So this should made the search for the parasites far easier. Rather, it can be said that it was made for it.



The problem is that Ayako has no real defense she can use against parasites.



She can damage the host of the parasite like normal, but that won’t do any damage to the parasite’s real body.



If she was facing a member of STARS, then she would be fine. But even if the situation is ever unfavorable, she would be able to run away.



(However, if they encounter Minoru...)



(... Maybe I am thinking too much.)



The Kuroba Family was only ordered to search for the parasites and the STARS members that entered Japan illegally. They aren’t searching for Minoru.



Tatsuya wasn’t aware that the advance team had already joined up with Minoru.



◇ ◇ ◇



Minoru took Raymond and Regulus to Chinatown. It was a small area. Before the war, this city was one of many in Japan, but after the war, it was the only one that remained.



This base wasn’t like a beach, so, open to the public. Those who worked there didn’t care if ownership of the base had changed, they simply obeyed without asking any questions. They were satisfied with their current owner, especially when he had the ‘key’ that could open the main gates. And after he had gained Zhou’s knowledge, he was also in possession of the ‘key’.



Another thing that was odd about the building was that it also looked like a normal Chinese building.



It was the next day already, Thursday June 27th, when Minoru was discussing things with Raymond and Regulus.



"... Our goal is to find the whereabouts of Major Sirius, who has temporarily escaped."



Minoru had asked Regulus about this matter. But he didn’t answer immediately since they weren’t using telepathy.



“If it is possible, I would like to take Major Sirius on on my own. It will be difficult, so I will wait for my companions to arrive.”



"Are they in Japan already?"



“They will arrive in four days, on the 1st of July, at night at the Zama Military base. The only problem with this strategy is that the Japanese have been strictly controlling the area since last February. When they arrive, they won’t be able to move immediately, because they need to find some information first.”





The event that they are referring to last February is the assassination mission that was given to Canopus to eliminate Gu Jie, so that he couldn’t be taken by the Japanese. After this incident, the military officers there have tightened their defence and have put extra security and surveillance on all of the USNA’s movements in Japan.



"I understand, I will try to find the place where Major Sirius is."



“I thought that Haruaki was the eldest son of the Kudou, who will also be its future Head, so how much authority do you truly have?”



This was something Raymond said while sitting from the side.



“You are very well informed; did you learn that through the Hliðskjálf?”



Raymond was shocked to hear this statement.



“You know about Hliðskjálf?”



An ambiguous smile was seen. For a regular person, this smile wasn’t so much ‘funny’ but rather ‘mysterious’.



"I also have various sources of information"



"............"



"Thanks for your collaboration.”



Raymond settled down with a strange face, next, Regulus went back to the initial conversation.



"So, what can we do for you, to get you your girlfriend back?"



"If you were able to, I would ask you… But..."



He had a bitter smile.



Regulus, on the contrary, was offended. He thought his abilities were not to be taken lightly.



But even when he thought this, he knew that there must have been a reason behind it.



"She is a member of the Yotsuba Family."



Regulus had to be sure, so he asked in a serious tone.



"When you say Yotsuba, do you mean ‘that’ Yotsuba?"



“Yes, I am talking about the ‘Untouchables’, that Yotsuba. Although she is only a servant, she is the assistant of the next Head of the Yotsuba Family.”



Raymond muttered: “A friend of Miyuki...?”, But no one commented.



"She is currently in a hospital in Tokyo, but the Ten Master Clans have been guarding the area to catch me, who has become a parasite."



“Does this mean that not only Yotsuba, but also the other Ten Master Clans are there?”



"Yes."



Minoru answered Regulus’ question without hesitation.



"In particular, the Families there are the Saegusa and the Juumonji."



Last night, although he did end up getting hurt, he still thought of a way to get past the Saegusa and the Juumonji.



“The problem isn’t the Juumonji or the Saegusa… but Tatsuya-san... you know him, don’t you?”



Regulus: "Oh, I know."



Raymond wanted to say something, but he decided to listen to the rest of the story.



"I know how to get past the Saegusa and the Juumonji, but when Tatsuya gets there, I can’t get to her."



The other day, it was a draw. Yet, Minoru knows for himself that Tatsuya wasn’t serious. If they both had the intention to kill each other, then he didn’t have the confidence to beat Tatsuya. It was the opposite. He felt that, the more he faced him, the worse the fight would become for him.



However, if he does fight Tatsuya seriously, it will not help his chances in convincing Minami.



This dilemma befell Minoru.

In addition, there was something else which Minoru hadn’t thought about.



They drawed last time. However, by doing so, Tatsuya can invent magic that is very effective against parasites.



Although he had learned a lot by obtaining the knowledge of Zhou. But he had nothing that was completely new. On the other hand, Tatsuya has the Yotsuba, the Fourth Research Institute and Japan’s main Ancient magician, Kokonoe Yakumo.



Deep down, what Minoru is really afraid of isn’t just Tatsuya’s power, but also the people around.



"Well, do you want us to face Tatsuya?"



This question about Tatsuya was the next to be asked by Regulus.



“You don’t need to be knock him down, the only thing you need to do is keep him busy and drag him away to somewhere while I go and take her.”



"So you want us to act as bait?"



"That's right."



"This is ridiculous!"



This was Raymond.



"You need to get rid off Tatsuya, otherwise, if we do it, it will provoke him to come searching for us!"



Raymond's hysterical tone got Minoru thinking.



“None of that matter, because I will have the parasite transplanted in her by the end of that day or I will give her back to the Yotsuba family.”



But the tone which explained this to Raymond remained calm.



"Don’t be lazy! If you really like this girl, don’t half-ass it!”



"Hey, Raymond..."



Regulus tried to calm Raymond down. However, his voice did not reach Raymond’s ears.



"Don’t let everything in this world hold you back and bother you!"



"Raymond, calm down!"

Regulus strongly pulled Raymond's shoulder back and forcibly shut him up.



"Sorry, Minoru."



"No, I don’t mind."



As he said, Minoru didn’t seem to care about Raymond’s outburst, at least on the surface.



“I also think that Tatsuya is an opponent who needs to be defeated, but for now, let’s give priority to Minoru’s goal.”



"I would be glad if you did that."



"Okay… but if I get the chance where I can take him out, you wouldn’t mind, right?”



"Yes, that’s fine”



The answer Minoru gave to Regulus, was given after a slight delay.



◇ ◇ ◇



On this day, Tatsuya spent some time in the morning on Miyaki Island and then went to First High School in the afternoon.



While the lessons were still going on, he went to the library, but after school he didn’t go to the Student Council Room, but to the Public Morals Committee Headquarters.



"Mikihiko, are you here?"



"Since when have you been at school?"



Mikihiko was surprise because he hadn’t seen him around.



"Since noon."



While he was answering Mikihiko, a little shadow tried to silently pass him.



"Kasumi, how are you doing?"



Tatsuya asked her.



She quickly stopped her feet.



"...I’m fine, sorry for worrying you.”



"Okay, that’s good."



Kasumi bowed her head to Tatsuya and quickly left the headquarters.



"...Did something happen?"



It was natural for Mikihiko to wonder about the scene that had just played out in front of him.



"It wasn’t anything too serious, anyways I want to ask you for a favor."



"And you’re asking me...?"



"Oh, you still remember what you said the other day, don’t you?"



Mikihiko’s complexion changed. So Tatsuya’s favor has to do with parasites.



"...Yes I do."



“The day before yesterday, Minoru showed up at the hospital where Minami has been hospitalized.”



"Well then..."



Then, Mikihiko’s eyes opened wide.



He quickly locked the door of the headquarters and set up a barrier that also ‘closed’ the room.



“...Now that’s taken care of, Tatsuya, let's sit down and talk. "



"Okay."



Mikihiko and Tatsuya sat across from each other at a long table.



"Uh... That day, did Kasumi fight with Minoru?"



“Yes, no one had any major injuries, but she slept for awhile because of magic. The only thing we were worried about were the consequences of that magic, because they were rendered unconscious by oxygen deficiency, but this didn’t seem to have any long term effects."



"Okay..."



Tatsuya himself was relieved, that, after he was done with his explanation, Mikihiko was also satisfied with the story and likewise felt relieved.



“So what do you want me to do? If you want me to help catch Minoru-san, then I’d be happy to help."



Mikihiko has had a firm belief from the very beginning that dealing with parasites is a job for an Ancient Magician.



"I may ask you to help me with the parasites later, but for now I would like you to help me with some magic practice."



"Helping with practice?"



Tatsuya explains the contents of the training and that he would like to practice it here at school.



“Since you only have time off after school, can we do it after you’re finished with your Committee duties?”



"What are you talking about?"



Tatsuya was a bit confused.



Tatsuya knows that these duties are important for her sister.



So for him, he thought that everyone would think of these duties similarly.



However, Mikihiko’s thoughts on the importance of extracurricular activities in high school were clearly different, making Mikihiko smile strangely.



“I don’t know what you think, but I think your training is more important that my work at the Public Moral Committee, and it’s about time for me to decide on my successor anyways, so this is the perfect opportunity.”



Thus, Mikihiko had accepted Tatsuya’s request.



◇ ◇ ◇



Generally, it is found that magicians can work either in daylight or at night. But parasites do have a preference.



They prefer not to be in the sunlight, kind of like a vampire, so they sleep during the day and work in the night, especially if nothing important needs to be done.



Also, they don’t experience jet lag. Regulus was interested to know about what had changed after becoming a parasite. But since he isn’t a scientist, he wouldn’t know the real difference. He was merely interested in it in the moment and decided to go to bed.



At this time, the door to his room opened and he could hear a knock, but he already knew who it was.



When Regulus slightly opened the door, Raymond stood there, alone, which he had expected.



"Can I come in?"



"Of course."



Honestly, he didn’t really like the time, but it seems like his visit was about something important. Regulus thought this and then fully opened the door.



"So what is it?"



"It’s about Minoru."



“What’s wrong with him? I didn’t see him make any particularly suspicious movements. ”



"Is that true?"



It seems that Regulus' words weren’t enough to convince Raymond.



"Minoru is strange."



"Why’s that?"



Raymond had only said a few words. But he needed time to think about what he wanted to say next.



"...Our telepathy isn’t able to communicate beyond national boundaries."



"And?"



"However, when our telepathy is shared, then we should share the same intentions, even for other parasites, this should be the same. But he is different."



Raymond and Regulus became parasites after the micro-black hole experiment that was conducted this month.



On the other hand, Minoru became one by modifying a parasite that was created during the black hole experiment that was conducted a couple of years ago.



But, despite this fact they are both parasites, the same creatures. But they weren’t. This wasn’t merely Raymond’s intuition, but he could actually feel it.



In addition, the parasite that is being used by Minoru, originated from the same laboratory in Dallas. So their origin shouldn’t be that different.



"Raymond, what do you want to say?"



“Why does Minoru disagree with us?"



Raymond responded to the question of Regulus.



"... Is this about Shiba Tatsuya?"



“Yes, our intentions were all to eliminate Shiba Tatsuya, but Minoru didn’t agree?”



“We haven’t discarded the idea of eliminating Tatsuya, we’re merely rearranging our priorities.”



"But it isn’t that too simple of an explanation, we had already decided that his elimination was our top priority."



“When we discussed this we were still in the States, and, like you said, our telepathy can’t cross national borders.”



Raymond got silent when he was confronted with his own logic.



“We are united with each other through our intentions, desires and will.”



This conversation shows the different sides to a parasite. The one side shows the parasite before it fuses with a person, the other shows the parasite before the person it has inhabited starts to erode.



"The strong will of Minoru leads him to save the woman he loves, so it isn’t surprising that this is his top priority."



“I can’t believe that! Our main goal should be Tatsuya!”



"You shouldn’t say it like that...."



Regulus, like Raymond, believes that Tatsuya should be neutralized. But this is because

Regulus himself thinks that they need to eliminate the ‘Strategic Class Magic that is a threat to their country’.



Raymond originally had the opinion that he wanted to ‘forget about Tatsuya’ and not ‘kill Tatsuya. This opinion was affected by the strong intent of the STARS members, who recognized that his ‘Material Burst’ is a threat that should be removed.



While the parasites have united with similar goals, their reasons can differ. It is certain that the individual with the strongest ‘wish’ will take the initiative but this doesn’t mean that all the parasites are governed by this ‘wish’. For example, Minoru’s involvement in this operation does mean that Regulus and Raymond will not be ignored if he takes the initiative.



"...I understand, then I will discuss this topic with Minoru through telepathy.”



"...If you think so, then that’s fine.”



Last night they had confirmed that Minoru could hear their telepathy. So if Raymond, Regulus and Minoru could all hear it, then when Minoru and Raymond were talking, Regulus could also listen-in.



This is the characteristic of someone that was going to take the initiative so Regulus has no reason to stop Raymond.



◇ ◇ ◇



Minoru suddenly woke up in the middle of the night. This wasn’t because his biological clock. He was awakened by a unexpected voice, that he heard in the depths of his heart.



(── Wake up, Minoru/we.)



When he was awakened, he had little smile on his face.



(Raymond? Why?)



Minoru also didn’t recognize him as ‘we’ like the other parasite do.



(You aren’t surprised? I think this is the first time we’ve talked in this collective consciousness.)



(This is the first time I’ve spoken here, but it isn’t the first time I’ve heard your voice.)



(That can’t be.)



Minoru laughed at Raymond’s surprise



(I thought telepathy didn't cross national boundaries?)



Minoru wasn’t going to mock the other side for his surprise. This was proof that his intentions hadn’t been interfered by Raymond and the others.



(That thought is wrong. Telepathy can even cross borders. It’s just that your intentions don’t influence me. Abroad telepathy is useful, but I just don’t belong to your consciousness. This mysterious restriction weirdly enough doesn’t occur when humans use telepathy.)

(I didn’t know about such a thing...)



(It is possible that when the parasite and the human fuse, the human’s consciousness won’t be overwritten.)



Raymond wasn’t the only one that remained silent. In the collective consciousness, Regulus was also surprised.



(It doesn’t matter now, even if I am connected with your consciousness. I wonder, does this have anything to do with my intentions differing from those of yours?)



(Why... Where are the parasites who were previously in this country not with you/us?)
