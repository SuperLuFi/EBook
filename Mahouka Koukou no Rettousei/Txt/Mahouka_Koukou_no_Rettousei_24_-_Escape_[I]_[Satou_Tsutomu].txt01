	18:45. Tatsuya left the train booth at a stop in front of the steps leading to the gates of the Kyuuchoji temple.





	Nobody was with him. To come alone was one of the conditions for Tatsuya from Toudou Aoba.





	Tatsuya, from the booth, looked slowly at the sides. Although he consciously acted so conspicuously to check... I mean, to show that he's checking that there's some kind of security around here, and that he's on the lookout, but he really couldn't find any signs of the observers.





	There were signs of persecution, they disappeared just before he arrived at the foot of this hill, so it seems he was not mistaken.





	It wasn't a coincidence. Perhaps the disciples of Yakumo (or even Yakumo himself) took care of it. As Yakumo does not trust the reception of guests (even if they are not invited guests) to inexperienced people making mistakes, Tatsuya decided that he did not need to worry about it.





	Whom he should worry about--is about himself. Even Yakumo should not interfere with a personal conversation with the famous Toudou Aobo, a secret player in the backstage arena of the political and business world. But you can't be completely sure of that. Perhaps this place was chosen to check Tatsuya out.





	Given this opportunity, he arrived 15 minutes early just in case. But if Yakumo is serious, it is extremely doubtful that so much time is enough. Keeping this in mind, no matter how overzealous, Tatsuya went up the stone steps.





	Unfortunately, Tatsuya fears have come true.





	Roughly in the middle of the path along the stone steps, the space around suddenly contort. He was shown the illusion that the ladder began to increase... No, that he himself began to shrink.





	He realized that his consciousness was affected by magic. This characteristic continuous effect was the peculiarity of ancient magic. Modern magic, on the contrary, gave importance to speed, and it did not have such features as long action to maintain the effect.





With his sight, Tatsuya could see that reality and the illusion were overlapping. This was because Tatsuya was pushing out the interrupting spells that were trying to penetrate his mind with a Magic Sequence, reading the contents of these sequences of magic.





	Even with magic acting on the Mind (Pushion information body), the sequence of magic was in the form of a Psion information body. Although Tatsuya was not able to use Mental Interference Magic, if the Magic Sequence is in a state where the activation is not yet complete, he could defend against the magic of the enemy or even intervene in the spell. The magic caused him to take some time to activate the magic with his hand. If this wasn’t Tatsuya, he would have already become a prisoner to the illusion.





	But he did not fall for the magic of illusions. Knowing Yakumo, he wouldn’t have expected this magic to stop Tatsuya. Kokonoe Yakumo was not a naïve adversary, continuing to use those methods that he has already shown that do not work. Once Genjutsu * does not work then move on to the next...





	[The same magic of illusions, just apparently a term from ancient magic.]





	"... Physical attack" It happened at the same time as Tatsuya said it to himself.



	From two sides he was attacked by cutting vortexes.





	These were not vacuum blades. It was magic, which, with the support from the air, crushed stone to powder, condensed in the form of ultra plates and sent them in to flight with high speed.





	On the edges of the stone steps there were no hedges, only a grove. Tatsuya instantly decomposed these four flying blades, flown from the darkness, which used to be nothing.





	Of course, Yakumo’s attack should not have ended with this. A man named Kokonoe Yakumo was not so kind as to (even when he is not serious) to finish a case with two types of attack, Genjutsu and cutting vortexes.





	The stone steps, where Tatsuya was standing on, were not long. This evening was cloudless and the moon shone. He was to be able to see the temple gate even at night, but now everything in front of him was filled with impenetrable darkness.



	And from this darkness flew arrows.

	Close sounds were not heard. He could not feel any signs of magic, damped sound, or signs of magic sending the arrows. Was it a magic trick to let out arrows without a sound, or a bow made to not make a sound when shooting?





	Sending this thought to the far corner of the mind, Tatsuya sent the bulk of his consciousness to the rain of the arrows.





	He laid out all the arrows as one aggregate. Applying magic, Tatsuya finally noticed that the arrows are intangible.





	"Magic of false information bodies!?" It was not a simple illusion. It was Genjutsu, influencing the information dimension and deceiving vision, "seeing" "Information". This is a magic of the same type as the "Parade " which Lina specializes at.





	It was a trick to expect that the attack would be something tangible.





	Tatsuya aggravated all five senses and ran up the stone steps. There were signs of any presence in front of him.





	Tatsuya did not stop and slow down and cautiously moved forward, but at the same time he could not suppress a sense of surprise in himself, that was directly carried out.





	In this battle, for the first time Tatsuya discovered the location of the enemy.





	Sharpened hearing caught the sounds of rustling clothes.





	Heightened smell of incense, which impregnated the clothing.





	Heightened sight noticed the contour of the figure, which came out of the darkness. The figure was above him on the ladder.





	Being below, Tatsuya was in a clearly disadvantaged position. Tatsuya jumped.





When he was at the same height as the enemy, he pulled his leg forward for a blow, without fear that the situation would become uncomfortable.





	The enemy curved the upper part of the body and dodged the jumping kick by Tatsuya.



	Flying past the remaining enemy, Tatsuya landed on a stone stage.





	Now Tatsuya was higher. But now Tatsuya was in an insecure position, rotating back to the enemy.





	Heightened touch caught the airflow. The enemy's attack was aimed at the back. Using Flash Casting, Tatsuya activated Move-Type Magic.





	The magic activated with Flash Cast had a small scale and a low power. The speed could be called the only advantage. But if you need to move only 60 centimeters, then with the flash casting, it was not a problem. And to evade the enemy's fist, the distance of 60 centimeters is also enough.





	When the enemy's direct punch overcame a distance of 30 centimeters, Tatsuya was already twice as far away. The enemy's attack ended in a blunder. Tatsuya turned around and prepared to attack at the same time as the enemy began to move forward.





	The edge of Tatsuya’s palm was at the enemy's neck. The enemy's Fist (Yakumo) was at Tatsuya’s armpit. Both of them stopped their hands on the verge without causing a blow.





	“Master. It was a pretty rude greeting.”





	“It's almost time. Come along. His Excellency is waiting.”





	Tatsuya looked at the watch. It showed 18:50. It's only been five minutes since he started climbing the stone steps. Tatsuya didn't think he could fight Yakumo in such a short time. It seems that Yakumo himself had chosen how long the fight would take.





	Although Tatsuya limited himself as not to cause damage to the environment, he was serious in this battle. However, Yakumo was able to act so as to take the schedule into account. With a little regret, Tatsuya realized that he was still far from Yakumo.





	When Tatsuya entered the main hall of the temple, there was no dust on his suit.



	All of the consequences by Yakumo’s "prank" had been removed using "Regrowth".





	Yakumo led him into the inner room. Toudou Aoba expected him in the side room, which led him through a passage to the right of the main premises of the temple (where an altar of a deity stands, which is prayed to in the temple).





	He had a suitable shaven head for a Buddhist temple. However, he was wearing a high-class business suit, clearly sewn to order. He easily held his back straight, his shoulders were wide, and the lower part of the body also had a dense physique. Signs of old age were already noticeable, but when he was young, he was undoubtedly a strong guy.





	But at the same time, on his head, below his would-be hair is the most distinctive feature.





	These bulging eyes under thick gray eyebrows. His face is not beautiful, it could be called Majestic. However, its turbid-white left eye caused a strange feeling of oppression of the interlocutor. This left eye created an impression of heterogeneity.





	Tatsuya also paid attention to this left eye. He realized that he had already met this old man in this temple in January of this year, on the 4th, to be more precise. But they did not quite meet, he only saw Toudou from his back when he was leaving the temple. Toudou then turned and looked at Tatsuya with his murky white eye, but said nothing and left.





	“Can I start introducing myself?” Tatsuya asked after sitting down on his knees and bowed.





	At first he thought it would be better to sit quietly until Yakumo presents him, but then he felt that in this case he would be captured in the blink of an eye by the opponent's pace.





	“Permitted.”





	The answer Toudou gave would sound like an anachronism if it were to be said by another person, but not by him. But the voice of Toudou perfectly fit his manner of speech.





	“Nice to meet you. My name is Shiba Tatsuya. It is a great honor for me to meet you.”





	"I am Toudou Aoba. Yotsuba Tatsuya, I've been looking forward to seeing you.”





	Toudou called Tatsuya "Yotsuba Tatsuya" instead of "Shiba Tatsuya". Tatsuya, who was still in his bow, did not react to these words.





	“You can raise your head. I permit you to talk directly.”





	Tatsuya straightened out like he was told. He did not look away, but looked Toudou straight in the eye. This was his interpretation of the meaning of "permit you to talk". But neither Toudou himself nor Yakumo reproached him for that.





	“I heard from Maya. That you want to explain something to me.”





	“Yes.”





Tatsuya didn't use such standard phrases, like, "Could you give me your time?" or "Could you listen to me?". He intuitively understood that Toudou did not need such formalities.





	“I'm listening to you.” And Toudou, indeed, immediately asked to go to the main topic.





	“In short, I have a plan to build a plant that produces energy resources using magic.”





	Tatsuya said this as a preface, and began explaining the details of the "project ESCAPES". Toudou did not interrupt Tatsuya and listened to his whole story to the end.





	“Clear.“ Toudou said after Tatsuya finished the story, saying he wanted to have a press conference as a means of retaliation in an information war that was announced by the two Clarks, Edward and Raymond.





	“Then, can you allow me to go out in front of the media?”





	“I give my permission. You can also use my connections to ask others for cooperation.”





	“Thank you very much.”





	Although Tatsuya said so, he felt no joy but vigilance. He concluded that everything went too well. Consent was not to be unconditional. There must have been some conditions. He was afraid he would be put in some impossible conditions.





	“By the way, I want to ask you something.”





	“What's that?”





	Tatsuya answered, without changing the expression on his face, but he could not get rid of the feeling that he was trying to evade the question.





	Toudou may have noticed the alarmed Tatsuya, but did not take advantage of it.

	“In your explanation, you mentioned that you are not looking for political power.”





	“Yes.”





	More precisely, he said that he is not going to ask for more power, if it does not interfere with the work of the plant, but he was not required to demand political power, so he did not dare to correct what Toudou said.





	“I'm not just talking about the power plant. The power you possess is incomparable to anything. It's not just that it exceeds the limits expendable for one person. In fact, this is not something that may be allowed to any organizations other than the state.”





	Tatsuya didn't mind that. He himself seriously considered the same as Toudou said. But despite this, Tatsuya was not going to give up his power or trust it to anyone.





	“Why do you use this power?” “What do you want to achieve with this force?”





	“A happy life.”





	Tatsuya responded immediately without showing any hesitation. Hearing this answer, Toudou clearly frowned his eyebrows.





	“Are you saying that this undeserved power of one man should only be used for one's own sake? Are you not interested in the welfare of society and the preservation of the state?”





	“A happy life is impossible without the well-being of society. Also, I believe that at the current stage of human development, the existence of States is absolutely necessary for the maintenance of public order.”





	“I mean, do you mind giving your power to the state for your own well-being?”





	“I would not use such arrogant phrases as "giving power"... But if you look from the standpoint of public order and National Defense, you, Your Excellency, are correct.”





	“That's good. Yotsuba Tatsuya.”





	Toudou again called Tatsuya "Yotsuba Tatsuya". They sat opposite to each other and looked into each other's eyes. Seeing the expression on the face of Toudou, Tatsuya realized that he was not mistaken, and said so intentionally.





	“I want you to do what I used to do. Be the deterrent force of this country.”





	The words of Toudou puzzled Tatsuya.





	“What do you mean by deterrent force? Does he want me to officially announce that I am the user of Material burst? But then it cannot be called "the same as before."





	“— ... You want me to declare myself a magician of strategic class?” Tatsuya decided not to waste time, rewinding his thoughts in a deadlock, and directly asked Toudou about his intentions.





	“Now it is not necessary. But if you need to, do it.”





	“Does that mean that in case of a military threat, I have to confront it? Like in the fall of two years ago?”





	At the end of October 19th, Tatsuya destroyed the fleet of the Great Asian alliance with Strategic Class Magic. “Does it mean that he will have me play this role again in the future?”





	“Deterrent power is the ability to avoid a threat to become a reality. The ability to confront a military threat that has become a reality is a conventional military force, not a deterrent force. The power of deterrence is something that is desirable, but should not be used.”





	But this probably wasn't what Toudou wanted.





	“You don't understand?”





	“It's a shame to admit, but I don’t.”

	In fact, he didn't fully understand what Toudou said. But Tatsuya decided not to speculate, but just to ask the right answer.





	“This is nothing complicated for you. It is enough to deter other countries by instilling fear in them.”





	“Understandable.” mentally agreed Tatsuya. This was roughly the same conclusion he came to.





	Apparently Toudou wants Tatsuya to play the role of the Demon King. But not as the king of demons, as in an RPG, which must destroyed by a hero. It’s more like a transcendental being who can cause disasters by simply touching it.





	“Your Excellency has previously said that it is desirable that a deterrent force should not be used. But to scare the enemy, don’t you need to show them your strength?”





	“If there is a need to demonstrate, usage can’t be avoided. I'll leave that decision to the people behind you.”





	And it seems that he will not have to choose this remedy. Tatsuya recently wondered whether a deterrent force was a necessary evil.





	Changing the activity of magicians from the military sphere to a civil one. As a result, that part of the military force, which is piled on the shoulders of magicians, will be reduced.





	Magic is a force that is somehow unrelated to the amount of material resources. The magicians that provide combat power are the aspect with which even small countries can confront large countries with many resources.





	If the magicians' fighting power is not grasped, small countries will likely not be able to confront large countries. Unfortunately, it is easy to predict a future in which the world will plunge into the era of war if the four major world powers notice it and begin to absorb the world. And if the world is again enveloped in the fire of war, magicians will start to be used as weapons. Trying to improve the lives of magicians is a vicious cycle.



	Perhaps to avoid such a future, he will inevitably have to become a deterrent force, replacing the lost fighting power of magicians who have gone into the civil sphere. Tatsuya thought so before he heard Toudou’s demand.





	If Tatsuya becomes a deterrent force, then "Project ESCAPES" — the first step to releasing magicians from their fate as weapons — will receive not only the tacit approval of Toudou, but also his support. Tatsuya had no reason to refuse.





	“As Your Excellency wishes.”





	Tatsuya expressed his intention to accept the Toudou’s proposal with an indirect expression.





	“Are you sure?” For the first time, Yakumo spoke, who until now only silently listened to the conversation between Tatsuya and Toudou. “In that case, you will be lonely.”





	“I don't mind.”





	Tatsuya really needs only one person. If this person is near, he will never feel lonely. The feelings of Tatsuya were arranged in such a way.





	And he knew that this person, Miyuki, would never leave him. Even death will not be able to separate Tatsuya and Miyuki. Because he won't let that happen.





	Being separated from other people was not a cause of concern for Tatsuya. Yakumo’s warning did not frighten Tatsuya.





	“The conversation is over.”





	It seemed that Yakumo still had something to say. However, Toudou decided to wrap things up. (for Toudou it was an intervention).





	“Your Excellency. What should I do?”

	Tatsuya was not going to talk to Yakumo. As he realized that Yakumo was worried about him, he decided to avoid quarrels that could ruin the relationship in the future.





	“I'm not going to give you any specific instructions. Do what you think you need to do.”





	The words of Toudou did not mean the granting of unlimited powers. It was the opposite.



	This meant that Toudou would not be responsible, no matter what happened.



	Responsibility for any problems would fall on Tatsuya.





	“I accept your offer.” Considering this fair, Tatsuya answered Toudou.





	Behind-the-scenes leaders never take responsibility in case of any problems. The burden of guilt has always been on the direct performers. Toudou couldn't even mention it.





	“Well. In that case, I'll also talk to my friends. It was a useful time.”





	Thus Toudou notified that the meeting is over.





	“In that case, can I leave you?”





	“You can go.”





	Tatsuya deeply bowed, touching the forehead of the floor, and then stood up. He sat on the bare floor (tatami) from the beginning, the seat cushion (BUD) was not provided. Holding his face down, not to look at the interlocutor, Tatsuya turned his back to Toudou and went out.





	After seeing Tatsuya to the gate of the temple, Yakumo returned back. Toudou waited for him to no longer be in same posture with which he talked to Tatsuya. Yakumo replaced Toudou’s cooled tea. While Toudou drinks tea, Yakumo sat in front of him, waiting.





	“And what do you really think about this conversation?”



	As a sponsor of the Yotsuba family, Toudou Aoba had access to detailed information about Tatsuya. It's impossible for Toudou not to see this information. He also exhaustively studied information about Tatsuya from external sources. Yakumo

	asked about the impression of their real meeting.





	“He's more broken than I expected.”





	Yakumo counted Toudou’s answer as "interesting".





	“Have you been disappointed?”





	“Even if it is broken, it does not mean that it cannot be used. For example, even if the weapon has a broken fuse, the bullet will still fly out if you pull the trigger.”





	“It depends on how to use it?”





	“Although there is a danger.”





	Toudou looked into Yakumo’s eyes. His murky white left eye looked directly into the Yakumo’s soul.





	"It seems that Your Excellency's power of Sight did not act on him.”





	“— ... Forgive me. It was unconscious.”





	“No, I don't mind.”





	Toudou Aoba hails from a Charmers family. If the data about his pedigree were true, it was one of the oldest families of supernatural power users in Japan.





	But Yakumo knew that Toudou Aoba was not be able to make full use of his "eye", because instead of honing his skills as a caster, he chose the way of fulfilling his family's responsibility to control the casters. If he said it was unconscious, it is true, not an excuse. Yakumo easily accepted Toudou’s apology.





	"Like you said, I couldn't look deep into the heart of Yotsuba Tatsuya. The Yotsuba, too, were able to create something interesting.”





	“Although it happened accidentally, but he is the final "Product".”





	Yakumo’s response paraphrased the expression Toudou used.





	“Right.” Toudou couldn't resist a stretched smile. However, he immediately returned a serious face. ”Kokonoe Yakumo. I want to ask you something.”





	“Yes, what is it?”





	There was still a light smile on Yakumo's face.





	"In an emergency, will you be able to kill Yotsuba Tatsuya by your own power?"





	However, having heard the question Toudou, Yakumo, as expected, could not continue to smile.





	“Hmm... Based on the experience of the previous test, I would say that the odds of winning are about 60%. If we include the outcome when we knock out each other at the same time *, we will get 70%”





	[The author uses the term from Kendo, which means a draw at simultaneous strikes. As I understand it, Yakumo means that an additional 10% will be found if he is trying to beat Tatsuya at the cost of his own life.]





	Under the previous test, he meant the battle on the stone steps. This wicked joke seems to have had such a hidden meaning.





	“Even with all your skills is there only a 30% chance to leave with nothing?”





	Toudou was genuinely surprised. But Yakumo’s answer had not yet finished.





	“No, the remaining 30% means my own defeat. The battle between this inept monk and him cannot end with escape.”





	“— ... Are you saying that even you, known as the reincarnation of Casin Koji, cannot escape?”





	“Six months ago I would be able to escape... Yes, and now the odds are just the same 60%. If it is a year later, this inept monk will not be able to do it at all.”





	“— Even so...?”





	Such a kind of visage Toudou, probably, has not shown to anybody, except Yakumo. Although the fact that Toudou gave Yakumo some slack was also due to the fact that he was really shocked.





	“Judging by his abilities surpassing those of this inept monk, there is nothing to be surprised about. Among the young people with whom this inept monk is familiar, there is only one person who can resist him. And if you look around the world, these people will not get more than the fingers on two hands.”





	“— ... Terrible times have come.”





	“And that's true. ... Your Excellency, another cup?”





	“Fine.”





	Yakumo took the cup from Toudou and went to the stove. With skillful movements he quickly brewed the tea, and then carelessly put the cup back. The old man Toudou carelessly, ignored the rules of decency, brought the cup to his mouth and slowly drank.



	“Thank you for the treat.”

	“Don't be grateful.”





	“Oh, yes. For some reason, only your skills of brewing tea do not improve.”





	Due to the arrogant words of Toudou, Yakumo answered only with the curve of a smile.





	“I'll go.”





	Toudou stood up.





	“I'll take you.” Yakumo said, not getting up.





	“You don't have to.” Without turning around, the old man Toudou said this, and opened the sliding door.





	When Tatsuya returned to the villa in Izu from the temple of Kyuuchouji, it was already around 10 o'clock in the evening. As soon as he returned, he went to the TV screen, but he wasn't going to call Maya. Time was already late. He only wanted to convey a short message that "Consent was received", through Hayama or his assistant.





	“— ... Tatsuya-san, did you want something?”





	However, for some reason Maya suddenly immediately appeared on the screen. Like she was waiting for a phone call.





	“Sorry about the time. I just got back from Kyuuchouji temple.”





	He reflexively responded with an uninteresting formal phrase, but Maya did not expect a witty answer from him.





	“Clear. Good work. Did you meet His Excellency?”





	“Yes. I got a project permit.”

	“Clearly...” Maya slightly screwed her eyes and looked at Tatsuya.





	“— and what was demanded in return?”





	Apparently, Maya also thought from the very beginning that in order to get support from Toudou, he needed to give something in return. The fact that she did not tell him in advance meant that she believed that Tatsuya would do it anyway, so there would be no real harm, and so he would not have to worry much.





	“I was asked to act as a deterrent force against other countries.”





	“— in such a sense, does that mean that Tatsuya-san finally has to reveal himself as a Strategic Class Magician?”





	Maya's delusion was the same as that of Tatsuya. That's why it didn't arouse a smile.



	Tatsuya thought she really believed that.





	“No. There is no need to officially announce it now. His Excellency said that he left all decisions to me.”





	“Everything to you? Oh, my... It's a serious responsibility.”





	Maya's thoughts were on the same path as Tatsuya. Was it because it was the rational process of thinking, or because Tatsuya in general is very similar to Maya...? These were the thoughts that now occur in the far corners of Tatsuya’s consciousness.





	“— ... In any case, the main thing is that His Excellency's consent has been received. You can hold a press conference without changing the schedule.”





	“Thank you very much.”





	Maya felt relieved after Toudou’s consent was received. Tatsuya also felt relieved when he received that response from Maya. The experiences that will be used by someone seem to be the same at the top and bottom, when there is, in reality, someone else.





“By the way, Tatsuya-san, do you remember our conversation about Miyakijima?”





	In order to catch the suddenly replaced topic of conversation, Tatsuya threw away all his superfluous thoughts and concentrated his consciousness.





	“Is this a conversation that was in the middle of April? When you said that a new research center would be built on Miyakijima?”





	“Yes, that's what I mean. I was thinking of partially changing this plan to attract attention to the plant from Tatsuya-san’s project.”





	Tatsuya couldn't answer quickly.





	“I also discussed it with Hayama-san. I think this is the best place for the Tatsuya-san’s project. How would you like that?”





	“— ... Using the word "attract", you mean as in third-party business partners?”





	His face did not show the feeling of alertness because all of this seems too convenient for him, Tatsuya first of all asked a question that seemed harmless. Upon hearing the question, the Maya smiled with a happy expression on her face, as if she were saying, "Well, I guess he noticed."





	“With the current scale of the project, only our own subsidiaries will suffice to implement it, but I believe that with the prospect of the future it is better to attract third-party assistants from the very beginning.”





	In this matter Tatsuya had the same opinion. If you run the factory only with companies associated to the Yotsuba, it is highly probable that the magicians involved there will also be only those who are under the patronage of Yotsuba. Then it will not be a "release of magicians", but only "a new project Yotsuba".





	“The area of the island is small, so, even if it becomes a virtual autonomous region, not many will raise complaints about this.”



	With this opinion Tatsuya also agreed. Although it’s an area of 8 square kilometers, in fact, this was comparable to a small town, but those who raise the noise of a "Mutant rebellion" or "the Kingdom of Magicians" will only be a few.





	“Well, how would you like that?”





	“I think I should be grateful.”





	“In that case, can we begin with construction?”





	“Yes. I'm counting on you.”





	Tatsuya had a vague sense of concern that his plan could be used for some other purpose. But he convinced himself that it is necessary to give priority to promote of the project.





	CEO of the "Hokuzan groups", Kitayama Ushio ("Business name" — Kitakata Ushio), has a great influence not only in business circles, but also in politics. It was not uncommon for him to hold meetings with the Government, but in most cases, his schedule is adjusted according to his circumstances, even if the schedule is planned in advance.





	But on that day, on the last Thursday of May, Kitayama Ushio was quite unexpectedly invited to a luxurious Japanese-style restaurant.





	He cancelled all other plans and went to this restaurant because the inviting partner was someone he could not refuse.





	Toudou Aoba. The circle of people who knew the name of this shadow influential man was limited. Unlike the famous "Traders of influence", Toudou Aoba never openly went on stage. But those who benefited from his name were aware that his abilities were undeniable.



	Fortunately, Ushio was never threatened by the shadow activity of Toudou. However, the founder of a rapidly growing company, which competed with Ushio, lost all his property as a result of underestimated the influence of Toudou. He received a long prison term for an ordinary crime, which in normal cases could not cause such problems, and was deprived of the right to start a new business. Ushio considered it an obvious demonstration to the rest.





	“It is a great honor for me to be invited by you.”





	“I'm sorry I called you so suddenly.”





	Toudou Aoba was already 60, and Kitayama Ushio was in his early fifties. Toudou’s tone was a little rough, but given the age of both, it did not sound unnatural. But the difference in their attitude reflected not the difference in their age, but the difference in the type of influence (political influence and economic power) that they owned.





	First, Toudou and Ushio killed a little time with the usual secular conversation. But Toudou Aoba, it seems, was not so tactless as to suddenly call one of the country's largest businessmen to just chat.





	He was just worried about the eyes and ears of the waiter serving them. The institutions used by such people as Toudou, are not only expensive, but besides providing tasty food and drinks, their employees also perfectly observe "the rule of the three monkeys" ( "do not look", "do not listen", "do not say"). Perhaps the man who survived in the world of wiles and intrigues, simply could not give up this superfluous vigilance.





	"I called you today because..." After some time, Toudou began to speak when the time for delicacies and sake were over. “— ... I want you to support the business of a young man.”





	“Do you mean for me to invest in this novice business of this young man?”





	Such inquiries were not uncommon for Ushio. But he was interested in it, because such a request was made personally Toudou himself.





	"And who is this amazing man who has earned the attention of your holiness?"



	“You already know this guy. His official name from the family register is Shiba Tatsuya.”





	“— ... Shiba-kun?” After a long pause, Ushio was able to speak only that. To hear this name from the mouth of Toudou was quite unexpected for him. — then this new business is something related to his inventions as Taurus Silver? or something related to a thermonuclear reactor?”





	“The second. Shiba Tatsuya tries to release magician from the role of weapons, giving them work to produce energy.”





	“I understand. I accept your proposal.”





	This time the answer was immediate. So much so that even Toudou was a little confused.





	“Don't you have to think about it?”





	Even after this offer, there was no doubt in Ushio.





	“Your Excellency must know that my wife and daughter are also magicians. My wife has been forced to live as a "weapon" for a long time, even though she has now retired.”





	Of course, Toudou knew about Benio, the wife of Ushio, and his daughter Shizuku.



	He looked forward to continuing the story.





	“But if the war begins, not only my wife, but my daughter will be sent to the battlefield. If it comes to a full-blown war, magicians, useless in the workplace, can be forced to become a combat force. I'm afraid of that.”





	“— but if we talk about the benefits, besides the war, there is still a project, announced by the nearing States.”





	Naturally, Toudou did not really want to cooperate with "Project Dione". These words were intended to show how serious Ushio is in his statement.





	“I don't want to sacrifice my wife and daughter. That is worse than forced military use.”





	“Hou. Why do you think that?”





	This question was no longer a test for Ushio, it proceeded from real curiosity.





	“— The essence of the "project Dione", the expulsion of magicians in to space. I do not know whether it is the will of Amerika, the intrigue of Edward Clark, or if it is done for some other reason, but it seems they want to expel Shiba-kun from the earth. But the damage is not the only thing. If the project is launched, the involved magicians will no longer be able to live on Earth. The earth will cease to be their home. This is the project.”





	The answer Ushio coincided with the conclusion that Tatsuya made. And most likely, Ushio and Tatsuya are not exceptions. There are probably many people who came to such conclusions enveloping this project.





	“Right.”





	Frankly speaking, Toudou also noticed the hidden target of the Dione project.





	“On the other hand, according to the project by Shiba Tatsuya, the area where magicians will feel at home will only expand. Energy production is necessary even during wartime. On the contrary, its importance is growing. When Shiba Tatsuya’s plant will be included in the state system of power supply, they will not be so careless, as to throw magicians on the front, causing a lack of energy. It’s well thought out.”





	And Toudou most valued "project ESCAPES" and Tatsuya for creating a compromising relationship between the supply of combat power and the supply of energy, which will create a situation where it becomes impossible for magicians to be used as weapons.





In terms of National Defence, this is an unacceptable situation. But if this was everything to the project, Toudou would have destroyed the Tatsuya’s project.





	But Tatsuya agreed to become a deterrent force.





	If the system of energy production with the nucleus in the form of a star reactor spreads to the whole world, other countries will lose their fighting power of magicians, and the relative military power of Japan with a trump card in the form of Material Burst will only increase.





	Although it was not clear yet whether someone comparable to Tatsuya who could be a deterrent force would be born in the next generation, but he will let the rulers of that time take care of it. Since Toudou lived in the present, he took responsibility for the present. He has not overestimated himself enough to be responsible for the future.





	“I Agree.”





	Ushio was not particularly worried about the lack of combat power of magicians. He wasn't a politician. He believed that if there is no magical combat force, it can be compensated by a conventional combat force. His company was not engaged in weapons, but if there was such a need to protect his family, he would without any doubt begin to fully support the military industry with his company.





	“Could you tell me more about the Shiba-kun’s project?”





	Tatsuya’s project corresponded to his interests. Ushio decided to meet him. Usually whenever his family is concerned, his thinking lapsed suspiciously. However, in such matters, Toudou was not going to deceive him, and this should not be a problem.





	“You'll ask him for details.”





	But now he could not deny that he doubted him too much.





	“Really. Sorry for the rudeness.”



	Realizing this, Ushio sincerely bowed. Cooling his head, he sent his consciousness to what he really had to check out here.





	“Your Excellency. I wanted to ask you something.”





	“What's that?”





	“What is the position of the Government regarding the project?”





	Now, the whole world welcomes "project Dione". There is no country that has officially taken an early position. He was afraid that the launch of a plan, opposing "project Dione", can be regarded as a diplomatic negative phenomenon. Toudou Aoba also understood it well.





	“The Japanese government will not intervene.”





	He made his position clear by saying this.





	Chapter 4





	Friday, May 31, 2097.





	Since the morning, numerous media representatives have rushed to the main office of Four Leaves Technology.





	Needless to say, their goal was a press conference held by "Taurus Silver". The meeting was to begin at 10 o'clock, but as the crowd of reporters and operators met in front of the building could interfere with traffic and other people's work, the venue was opened earlier, at about 9 o'clock.





	Even traditional large newspapers, usually without any interest in the magic industry, organized several groups in the very first rows. Although many of their colleagues had a conceited relationship, but for a third-party observer, these colleagues were no different from the first.





	Their indiscriminate conversations died down when the staff responsible for communication with the media came to the podium. The reporters, holding their breath, watched the FLT employees perform last checkups of the microphone and lighting.





	The digital clock in the conference room showed 10 o’clock. The front door of the conference hall opened, and Tatsuya and Ushiyama came to the podium.





	Under the clicks of the shutters Tatsuya stood in front of the microphone. The chairs on the podium were not used.





	Behind Tatsuya hung a big screen. On it appeared the description "Stellar Furnace Energy Plant Project".





	The conference room was filled with noise. These were voices expressing doubt as to why the presentation of a new business project is taking place. Not paying attention to the confusion of the assembled, the responsible employee announced the beginning of the press conference.

	“— I am Shiba Tatsuya, and I am responsible for the development of software for Taurus Silver projects.”





	"I am Ushiyama Kinji, and I am responsible for the development of hardware for Taurus Silver projects."





	The noise immediately increased. Media representatives gathered here firmly believing that that this young man (although he was still a schoolboy, the appearance of Tatsuya can be expressed by the word "young man", and not "boy") in the suit was the real identity behind Taurus Silver. But this man in the working jumpsuit also called himself Taurus Silver. In the media camp, chaos began.





	“-uh, Taurus Silver is not the name of one developer.”





	As the reporters did not follow with questions, Ushiyama continued to speak.





	“It’s the name of the development team, consisting of him and me. We have already updated the personal information about the applicants, and you can confirm it at the patent office.”





	“— ... Why did you deceive the people so much?" When at last a hand was picked, one of the female reporters asked this. In fact, they were insensible words, which lacked respect for the interlocutor.





	“We weren't going to cheat. Often applications for patents are filed under the name of the firm, and even now it is common practice to keep confidentiality of personal information about the individual members of the group.”





	“B-but Taurus Silver is regarded as a brilliant engineer, who in just 1 year has advanced the development of CAD software by 10 years, and your company did not deny it, right?”





	“We have never confirmed excessive estimates like "brilliant engineer" and other things like that.”





	The reporters had nothing to say to this irrefutable answer by Tatsuya.

	“The reason for the confidentiality of personal information was that the Youn- *... That Shiba is a minor. For the same reason, we refused to hold an interview.”





	Ushiyama continued nervously.





	[He almost misspoke, beginning to say, "Young master.]





	The privacy of minors in the present period was a stable social principle. The media couldn't go straight against it.





	"Does it mean that what the mysterious man named "The First Sage" said in that message, was only half true?” Another reporter delicately changed the subject, asking another question.





	“Because Taurus Silver is the name of the team consisting of me and Ushiyama, the message that Taurus Silver is me, Shiba Tatsuya, is misinformation.”





	Tatsuya changed his first-person address to "Watashi" to seem impolite to this media representative. After all, the content of the answer was a direct attempt to quarrel with him.





	“Misinformation on TV?”





	“The news showed information different from the truth. That's called misinformation, isn't it?”





	“But the fact that you are Taurus Silver is true!”





	There was a piercing hysterical scream from another part of the conference room.





	“— it was mentioned earlier that Taurus Silver is not the name of one person.” Tatsuya turned to this reporter and answered him with a calm but seemingly brazen voice. Objecting voices stopped.





	“However, it is also true that we have caused confusion among people around the world.”





	Here Ushiyama took advantage of the moment, and his awkward voice wedged in to the conversation.





	“Therefore, here and now, we are announcing the correct information regarding Taurus Silver.”





	The conference room was noisy again.





	“— ... What do you mean?”





	“It means that we are terminating our activity as Taurus Silver.” In this sense, Tatsuya returned the obvious answer to the brave question.





	“Does that mean you're stopping CAD development?” The question came from a reporter from a single publication firm familiar with the magic industry.





	“Ushiyama will continue to develop CADs, and I'll do another thing.” Tatsuya said this and pointed his hand at the screen behind him.

	“— This is a new project for the organization and supply of Energy for industrial and domestic needs, using a Stellar Furnace, or in other words a thermonuclear reactor, which works with Gravity Control-Type Magic.





	Journalists began to talk indiscriminately within their groups. Tatsuya silently stared at them until the noise died down.





	“The design of the installation is not new." Tatsuya said this, so order could return to the conference hall. Representatives of the press did not interrupt his explanation.





	“— the installation is planned to be built on a remote island or on the sea surface. With the help of the power generated by the Stellar Furnace reactor, hydrogen will be produced from the sea water, which will be further sent to land. We hope that together with the process of hydrogen production, we will contribute to the purification of the marine environment by removing harmful substances from sea water.”



	A simple animation appeared on the big screen showing the mechanism of the installation. Comments on the animation were not told by Tatsuya, but by an FLT employee.





	After the animation was finished, the conference room filled up with loud noise. A correspondent from an industry magazine raised his hand as an interested person.





	“— ... Are you not going to send electricity directly from the thermonuclear reactor?”





“I think that many will be concerned about the stability of the Stellar Furnace reactor, so first we decided to build a plant at a sufficient distance from the urban area. Therefore, taking into account the loss in the transmission of electricity to the far distance, I designed the scheme of converting it into hydrogen fuel.”





	“I think that a significant number of magicians will be needed for the operation of a thermonuclear reactor.”





	It was said by a reporter from a publication directly related to magic.





	“You're right. Magicians participating in this project will be transferred to the island or floating base, on which the plant with the presented installation will be located.





	“— Are you going to create an independent State of magicians!?”





	This question was asked by a reporter from a newspaper that was usually set up to be negative towards magic.





	“Because of its peculiarities, the plant will not be able to function with only one magician. The staff will include more non-magician engineers.”





	“— in other words, do you mean that a minority of magicians will rule the majority of ordinary personnel?”





	“— The plant will be operated in compliance with all laws and regulations.”





	Tatsuya could not restrain his habit of fighting against magicians. However, he now gave a textbook answer, and at the present stage, when there was no specific data, no one could continue to make false accusations.





	“How do you respond to the request for participation in "Project Dione"? “





	This was a "cover fire", the question was asked in a provocative voice by a reporter from the same company as the previous one.

	“The request from the National Scientific Agency from the USNA was about the participation of a schoolboy, calling himself Taurus Silver. But a little earlier, "Taurus Silver" ceased to exist, so I can no longer respond to this request.”





	“These are empty excuses!” The reporter reflexively shouted in response to the brazen words of Tatsuya.





	Tatsuya himself considered it an empty excuse, so he was not embarrassed by this exclamation.





	“Did Mr. Edward Clark from the National Science Agency require me to participate?”





	This objection was also prepared in advance. It was a counterattack that the reporter would not be able to answer with "Yes."





	“But it's obvious that Mr. Clark meant you when he was talking about Taurus Silver.”





	However, the reporter still persisted.





	"Is that so?"





	Tatsuya knew what the reporter said was true, but for the rest it was not so obvious. Tatsuya did not answer with "Yes" or "no", he just answered with a question. The reporter was just speculating. So when he was asked, "Is that so?", he had nothing to say.





	“Even if another invitation comes from the Dione project, I won't be able to accept it. The project of a plant with the Stellar Furnace reactor has already moved to the stage of choosing the place for construction. I don't have time to participate in other major projects.” Tatsuya summed it up.





	Tatsuya’s press conference was broadcasted live on TV.





	Speaking of TV, it was meant not to be covered by many large radio channels. Rather to a small cable news channel. The target audience of this channel were magicians and people interested in magic. It broadcast various news related to magic, and was also known as the channel, broadcasting absolutely all Nine School Competitions.





	Kudou Minoru, who missed school because of his poor health, watched this broadcast, sitting on his bed in his room.





	“Tatsuya-san is so amazing...” said Minoru while sighing when the broadcast was over. He turned the TV off and went to bed. There was a whirlpool of admiration for Tatsuya in Minoru’s thoughts.





	He also admired the plan for the energy plant with the nucleus in the form of the "Stellar Furnace" (at the press conference, Tatsuya did not use the name "Project ESCAPES").





	He admired the power with which Tatsuya was able to overcome the pressure of what made him an enemy to the world, and used the heightened attention for his own purposes.





	Minoru envied Tatsuya to the depths of his soul.





	Tatsuya did not give up and, freely and unrestrictedly, use his wisdom and power to fight the society and the world.





	And he, in comparison with this, only lies on this cramped bed, watching other people's affairs. Which is unfortunate.





	Minoru was thinking. That if he only had a healthy body...





	Minoru was sure that he was not inferior to Tatsuya in mind or magic. This was in no way overconfidence by Minoru.





	Minoru assessed his abilities after he saw Tatsuya’s abilities. His ability was recognized not only by himself. Also by his grandfather, Kudou Retsu, who always cherished his own talent.





	He successfully avoided this bad feeling at the Thesis Competition of last year (although Tatsuya was in it but did not present), Minoru won there, beating Isori Kei from First High and Kichijouji Shinkurou from Third High.





	When he remembered the Thesis Competition, he went through his memories, one after another. The memories of the events that took place less than a month before the contest came back to him.





	About how they first fought together the next day, October 7th.





	The next time they met was two weeks later, October 20th.





	The day afterwards, he was bedridden from the heat and made it uncomfortable for them.





	On October 27th. Having closed Zhou Gongjin’s escape route, he believed that he managed to repay the debt that he owed that he had from when he got ill.





	Minoru remembered that entire day. After all, this was the first time since his birth that he was useful to someone. So Minoru remembered this day...





	With these memories in his thoughts, Minoru did not notice how he fell asleep.



	In his dream he returned back to that day, October 27, 2096.





	There was a guy in on the other side of Uji Bridge. In a dream, Minoru observed himself from a stranger’s view.





	From the car on which he stood, sparks and fire poured out.





	Right before the engine exploded, he jumped out of the car and looked intently at Minoru.

	Minoru realized that he was Zhou Gongjin. This is what the dream looked like from his view. He escaped along the Uji river, going in a downward direction.





	Then he was attacked by a “Girl” that suddenly appeared with a bob hairstyle.



	Despite the fact that this was a dream, he could clearly feel strong pain.





	These memories, they should have not been known by Minoru. This experience he should not have experienced.



	Before him, Ichijou Masaki appeared, and behind him, Tatsuya.





	Maybe he's rebuilding this scene in his imagination based on reports from the incident? Minoru was covered in cold blood, despite the fact that he was in a dream.





	Masaki’s attack tore the inside of his shins of both legs. This time there was no pain.





	“I will not perish. Even if I die, my existence will continue!”





	He thought he said this with his voice. Undoubtedly, one who dies like this, holding such a thought, usually will wander in the world of the living as a ghost. Minoru felt sympathy, having personally experienced the last moments of Zhou Gongjin’s life.





	But the dream was not over. Zhou Gongjin's consciousness continued.





	Zhou Gongjin sailed upstream the Uji River.





	Suddenly the dream came from Minoru’s point of view. Zhou Gongjin's ghost was approaching him.





	“Become one with me!” Zhou Gongjin shouted and flew at Minoru, who was standing on the Uji bridge.





	The surrounding landscape has disappeared. The bridge also vanished from under his feet. Minoru hung in the air over the river.

	Minoru realized that it was no longer a dream about the events that occurred 7 months ago, but an event that is actually happening in the present time.





	Memories of the events of that time somehow brought him here. More than six months later, Minoru realized that Zhou Gongjin’s ghost drew his attention.





	"Become mine!"





	The fingers of both Zhou Gongjin’s hands pierced his chest. Although it is better to say "plunged". Something invaded him. Although Minoru was aware of this, he was surprisingly calm.





	Even for himself, it was unexpected that he was not afraid of this "evil spirit" trying to capture him. He didn't have to be afraid because he knew what to do.





	Minoru quickly understood this. The thing that was trying to swallow him was of the same essence and nature as the parasites.





	He was an undisputed genius and the strongest user of the magic in the Kudou family. His brothers and sisters did not realize it. And his father apparently would not admit it. But his grandfather certainly understood it.





	By the age of 16, Minoru had already mastered all the magic of the Kudou family.





	“Go away, Ghost.”





	Minoru used Mental Interference Magic. In this dream, magic is not used on something physical, that’s why his magic was still going to work.





	Coming out of Minoru’s "body", like the wind, a stream of luminous particles burst out, and with this force, which was like a hurricane, blew Zhou Gongjin’s "body" away.





	In the world of Minoru’s dreams, he and Zhou Gongjin were both in ghost bodies.



	Their minds existed in the form of ghosts.

	He cannot be blown away using psions, like with "Zone Interference", but Mental Interference Magic makes it possible to both attack and defend.





	Zhou Gongjin’s hands were separated from his “body”. They were immersed in Minoru’s body to the wrist and were submerged to the part from where they was torn off.





	“Give me your body.”





	Not frightened, Zhou Gongjin again flew to Minoru.





	“Although it's not a usable and naughty body, I can't give it away.”





	Minoru has activated the following magic. From the darkness, lightning of all colors of the rainbow appeared and surrounded Zhou Gongjin’s ghost body. In this world, magic was called, which was worth thinking about it. Minoru felt more freedom compared to the real world.





	“Give it to me...”





	The Phantom body of Zhou Gongjin was now dark in several places, its once graceful appearance was now covered with black spots, and the body was lacking some parts.





	“— ... I'm sorry, Zhou Gongjin. But it's time to finish this.”





	Minoru owned all the magic of the Kudou family. And together with this magic, came the methodology to create a Parasite Doll. Including the binding parasite Loyalty spell.





	“Obey Me, Ghost. Become my food.”





	Minoru held Zhou Gongjin in his hands and he activated the magic for enslaving Parasites.





	The usual loyalty spell is arranged in such a way that if you comply with certain conditions, compensation is provided. The compensation used in the production of Parasites is to supply the Parasites with Psions which are necessary to them. The condition for this is absolute obedience. In case of disobedience, the parasite is deprived of already absorbed Psions and needs to submitted again.





	The compensation offered by Minoru is the existence within him. And the condition is to be preoccupied. In other words, using the loyalty spell, Minoru "ate" Ghost Zhou Gongjin.





	“— ... Good work. Thank you for your knowledge.”





	Minoru felt like the "secret knowledge" associated with "Demons” accumulated by Zhou Gongjin became his own.





	Minoru in his sleep showed an "Angelic" smile. This smile undoubtedly belonged to a messenger looking from heaven to earth, filled with beauty, haughty and devoid of humanity.





	Tatsuya expressed his gratitude to Ushiyama, who accompanied him during the press conference, he thanked the staff that drafted the venue, and was going to leave the main office.





	He didn’t want to run into his father. He had no desire to meet him, and his father obviously did not want to either. This assumption of his father's feelings was not a mistake.





	Because it was not a subordinate of his father that stopped Tatsuya, who changed his clothes in the locker room and went to the underground parking, trying to avoid the reporters at the main entrance, but it was stopped a woman calling herself a member of the Magic Association.





	“Is this going to be a long conversation?”





	Tatsuya has no particular bad feeling towards the Magic Association’s feelings, but he asked because he wanted to leave this place as soon as possible. And he did not underestimate the ability of the press to sniff around.





	“It won't take long. I just need to get your answer...” The employee timidly answered the question of Tatsuya. The Magic Association sent not a man but a young woman to give Tatsuya a better impression.





	But it clearly had the opposite effect. She was frightened by the sight of Tatsuya, as if she had a very meager experience with men (meaning no sexual experience). When a person has no special tendencies, this is only used to offend.





	But Tatsuya also became awkward, because he had no hobbies like scaring women for fun.





	“In that case, get in the car.”





	But when he offered the employee of the Magic Association this, it was impossible to fully say that this act was not a manifestation of revenge.





	“Tomorrow afternoon...?”





	The request of the Magic Association was that they wanted him to meet Edward Clark at the Magic Association, who is going to arrive in Japan tomorrow.





	“Yes! In the afternoon, at any time that is convenient for Shiba-san!”





	The employee begged Tatsuya in a desperate voice. Looking at her condition, it was not possible to say, that she is not accustomed to men, but it is possible to say that it is difficult to talk to men, or she could even have androphobia [fear of men].





	What was the Magic Association’s purpose for choosing such a woman? This was an obvious mistake in choosing roles.





	“It's a pretty sudden invitation.”

	“I'm sorry, please!”





	The car was on autopilot, but Tatsuya was sitting in the driver’s seat, according to the rules. And the employee of the Association was holding the door of the front passenger seat. Tatsuya decided to finish this conversation quickly, but not out of compassion, but because of her irritating behavior.





	“There's nothing to be done. Then I’ll be there tomorrow at 14:00, at the Kanto branch.”





	“Is it fine?”





	“I can't afford to refuse, can I?”





	These words were not an attempt to bargain, but Tatsuya’s true feelings.





	Though not officially, Edward Clark asked for a meeting as a representative of the USNA government. He decided in advance, that at the end of the meeting, refusing to meet could have negative consequences in diplomatic relations. Tatsuya was not so arrogant or childish as to ignore it.





	“T-T-thank you very much!”





	The employee exaggerated her emotions too much. Tatsuya was no longer able to tolerate this irritation. He stopped the car on the side of the road and he kicked her out.





	Tatsuya went to First High. Initially, he planned to go there immediately from the main office of FLT. Although he did take a long route, he still had the feeling that it took too much time.





	He changed everything but his jacket into the school uniform in the locker room of FLT. After changing the jacket from a business suit to the long jacket of the school uniform, Tatsuya went not to the classroom, but to the principal’s office. There he told the school staff that he wanted to meet with the principal.





	It was almost noon, the lunch break was about to start. Usually, if student asked to meet with the director at such a time, they will only be reprimanded and will be kicked out of the office. But, as expected, the staff of First High knew about the Tatsuya’s situation. In the current situation, not knowing his circumstances would be strange.





	Was the director's schedule accidentally free at that moment, or did he send someone away when he heard about the visit? Tatsuya got into the director's office very quickly.





	“Thank you very much for taking the time for me, even though I came so suddenly.”





	First of all, Tatsuya politely thanked him.





	“I was watching the broadcast.” Director Momoyama suddenly changed the topic. “Did you refuse to participate in project Dione because you had something on your mind when you told me?”





	But once Momoyama asked this, it was easier for Tatsuya to answer.





	“Right.”





	“— The project of a power plant with the Stellar Furnace reactor... Don't you have a shorter version of the name?”





	“— Given the planned location of the plant, it is unofficially called the "Project for the extraction of marine resources and the elimination of harmful substances from the coastal zone of the Pacific", or abbreviated "Project Escapes" from the first letters of the words from the phrase in English: "Extract both useful and harmful Substances from the Coastal Area of the Pacific using Electricity generated by the Stellar furnace.".





	“ESCAPES? This name cannot be used officially.”





	Momoyama quickly realized that this name contains the hidden meaning of "Escape for magicians from military use."





	“Yes. That is why at the press conference I called it a "project for a power plant based on a stationary Stellar Furnace".”





	“Hmm... So how far have you gotten in this project?” Momoyama asked, looking at Tatsuya standing in front of his desk. Standing there, most of the students would respond with a trembling voice.





	“— we have already started the actual implementation. It's not a sham to escape from the Dione project.”





	Momoyama really suspected that this was a pretext for not participating in the Dion project.





	“— ... I believe you.”





	In itself, the word 'believe' was not proof of what he really believes with all his heart, but Momoyama still said this to Tatsuya.





	“Thank you very much.”

Although you’re not involved in Project Dione he did not express this directly.

	“Now on to the condition of exemption from classes...”

“Release from classes is not canceled.”





	Momoyama interrupted Tatsuya’s speech.





	“I can guarantee your graduation. And a recommendation to the University of Magic too. So you should focus on Project ESCAPES.”





	“— ... Are you sure?”





	The words of Momoyama sounded too suspicious to Tatsuya. The exemption from the classes originally provided by Tatsuya was done under the pressure of the USNA to make him participate in the Dione Project. Now that Tatsuya has officially refused, Momoyama no longer had to treat him in a special way.





“I think that Project Dione has a deeper meaning, giving an honorable way of life to magicians. That's why I asked you to participate in it.”





	Momoyama implied that his special attitude towards Tatsuya was not only because of the pressure of USNA. Tatsuya could not understand whether this was true, or if it was to pretend that he succumbed to the pressure of the government.





	“But now I feel that your "Project ESCAPES" also has a deeper meaning, giving the magicians a peaceful way of life. According to my estimation, its social significance is not inferior to Project Dione. So I don't think it's necessary to change my attitude.”





	“— ... Thank you very much.”





	Even after these explanations, Tatsuya did not understand the true motives of Momoyama, but, above all, he thanked him for the praise and bowed.





	“Good luck.”





	Bowing again in response to the words of Momoyama, Tatsuya left the principal's office.





	When Tatsuya left the director's office, it was still about 10 minutes before the lunch break began . He initially planned to return to Izu, but after short hesitation, he went to the school council room.





	He passed up to the highest room of the fourth floor, with such a route, that he would not to be seen from the classrooms in which classes were now being held.





	His ID card opened the door without any problems.





	He was not absent for too long. Tatsuya did not feel particularly nostalgic, he just took his usual place and turned on the terminal.





	He checked the status of the current events, since Miyuki and others had promoted him to the School Board without much delay.

	Working on cases that had nothing to do with his work, he didn’t notice that the lunch break had begun.





	Miyuki and the rest should come because they’re having lunch. Therefore Tatsuya thought this, but contrary to his expectations, Miyuki arrived even sooner.





	"Onii--, no, Tatsuya."





	“Tatsuya-san?”





	Miyuki was not alone. Both Honoka and Shizuku, who was not in the Student Council, and second years Izumi, Kasumi and Minami came to the school council room almost simultaneously.





	“You can't say we haven't seen each other in a while, right?”





	Today is Friday. Last time they met was near the gate of First High on Monday. He’s doubtful that the greeting "Not seen for a long time" came to this occasion.





	And for Miyuki this "long time not seen" was all the more unsuitable, because he communicates with her every evening.





	“— ... You came to tell the school about today's press conference?”





	Miyuki quickly recovered from the shock and gave an unexpectedly correct guess.





	“Right. How did you guess?”





	“Given the press conference, I thought it might be related to it...”





	As Miyuki said, she was informed in advance about what will be told at today's press conference.



	“Yes. I just talked to the principal. Although I declined to participate in the Dione project, the release from classes still remains in effect.”





	“That means... What were you going to do here?”





	Not only Miyuki, but Honoka was also somewhat nervous. It seemed that they felt uncomfortable with his presence. Tatsuya had such an impression. The ones gathered in the school council room were Miyuki, Honoka, Shizuku, Izumi, Kasumi and Minami. All but Tatsuya, were girls. Maybe they were going to talk about something girly?





	"No, this is... We were going to see the press conference here, Tatsuya.”





	“— ... Got it.”





	When Tatsuya held a press conference, classes were still going on. Conscientious students could not watch it live.





	Miyuki probably recorded the broadcast on the school board's server. The channel associated with Magic news, definitely, had a contract to broadcast to the Magic Schools.





	“Then I'll go to the library, call me when you go home.”





	Even Tatsuya was ashamed to watch his press conference on TV. As if running away from it, he hurried out of the school council room.





	After school, Tatsuya met with his friends in the school cafeteria. Not only with Miyuki and others whom he met in the school board room, but also with the rest of their regular company. Since he got here by car today, it was impossible to go to the habitual café, located on the way to school.





	The students' views, directed at them from all sides, were annoying. But today they could make an exception.





	The record of the press conference was reproduced not only in the school board room. At lunchtime, the recording was also shown on the big screen in the dining room. Many students watched the recording on their personal information terminals. So everyone was interested.





	“Tatsuya, I saw it.”





	Naturally, his friends also looked.





	“Good job.”





	“Tatsuya-san, only you could think of that.”





	“I think it's really amazing. I'd have never thought of that before.”





	After Leo, this was said by Erika, Mizuki and Mikihiko. The reaction was more open among his former classmates than among the school board group.





	Perhaps it was because they had no extra emotion.





	“— Construction of a plant that generates energy using a Stellar Furnace? Tatsuya. Doesn’t this have a simpler name, like an abbreviation?





	Leo asked something similar as Principal Momoyama. Perhaps many have thought about this.





	“There is an unofficial abbreviation, "Project ESCAPES".”





	“Who’s to escape? Where does the abbreviation come from?”





	“Extract both useful and harmful Substances from the Coastal Area of the Pacific using Electricity generated by Stellar furnace.” E from "Extract", S from "Substances", C and A from "Coastal Area", P from "Pacific", E from "Electricity" and S from "Stellar". Altogether, ESCAPES. This translates to: "Extraction of both useful and harmful

	substances from the coastal zone of the Pacific Ocean using the electricity produced by the Stellar Furnace."





	“Ha-ha... I'm guessing you matched that word.”





“Correct.”





	Leo, as usual, decided to show his uncharacteristic wit.





	“Escape from what?”





	“From military use.”





	Having heard the words of Tatsuya, before him the cheerfully smiling Leo made a serious face.





	“— ... Even so?”





	Leo is a magician developed as a weapon with an improved body. He clearly realized that "escape from military use" is an "Escape from the fate of magicians compelled to be a weapon."





	Not just Leo. Minami, who is also such a magician, of course, also understood this. The other members of the group also wore a different expression. In particular, the faces of Honoka, Kasumi and Izumi froze. These three were highly likely to have genes that had been modified in the generation of their fathers and grandfathers.





	“Yes, that's right.”





	Tatsuya did not conceal this intention. Friends would understand it, so there was no reason to hide it.





	“You have to succeed, no matter what it takes.” Mikihiko said in a serious voice.





	“It's going to be all right, it's Tatsuya-kun.”



	Erika tried to blow away the tense atmosphere, and cheer everyone up. Their expression softened when they heard her.





	“Right. If it's Tatsuya-san, it's going to be all right.”





	“You said you had to choose a place. And when will the construction actually begin?”





	After Honoka, whose speech not only expressed confidence, but was closer to religious belief, Mizuki asked about a specific schedule.





	“The project has already started.”





	“Uh? Then what about school...?”





	“Although my exemption has not changed, I plan to go back to school, when the situation will calm down a bit.” With a slight smile Tatsuya answered the wide eyes of Mizuki.





	“Is that so? Thank God...”





	Honoka exaggerated her relief. This behavior caused all of them to smile.





	“Tatsuya-san.”





	Tatsuya turned to Shizuku, sitting next to Honoka.





	“What's that?”





	“My father wants to meet you”





	Kasumi rounded her eyes from Shizuku’s words. It was easy to guess what she had mistakenly thought, but the real meaning was, of course, different.





	“I think it's about the project.”





	“I got it. When can I come?”





	Tatsuya immediately guessed that it was the work of Toudou. But he did not show this, but he asked Shizuku with a serious expression on his face.





	“He said he'd be happy to meet on Sunday.”





	“On what time specifically?”





	“The exact time has not been assigned.”





	“In that case, how about I bother you around the afternoon, say, 1 o’clock?"





	“I think it's going to be all right. I'll call you if the circumstances change.”





	“Yes, that’s fine.”





	Thus, this simple coffee break accidentally became a significant event for Tatsuya.





	As a result, Tatsuya didn’t go to the villa in Izu, rather he went to the new house in Chofu.





	Tomorrow he was to meet Edward Clark at the Kanto branch of the Magic Association, and the day after tomorrow he was going to visit Shizuku’s house. So returning to Izu was ineffective.





	This will be the first time Tatsuya stays overnight in the building in Chofu. Miyuki was more excited about this fact than Tatsuya. No, to be more precise, Tatsuya did not worry at all. Miyuki was the one that worried.





	“Tatsuya-sama, Miyuki-sama, sleep well.”





	“Yes, good night.”

	“Good night, Minami-chan.”





	The upper floor of the building was fully occupied by the residence of Tatsuya and Miyuki. Its structure was the same as that of an ordinary mansion, and it had several different rooms with separate entrances.





	A separate entrance to the rooms of Tatsuya and Miyuki, and a separate entrance to the room where Minami lived. ... In other words, Minami "changed her work" from "maid who lives in the employer's family" to "Maid on Demand".





	In other words, it meant that Tatsuya and Miyuki would spend the night alone in their residence. For Miyuki this was a situation where she could not be no excited.





	“Onii-sama.”





	Miyuki changed Tatsuya to "Onii-sama" Ever since they got into the car, and only “they” were around.





	But that didn’t start today. Even in phone calls, she called him that. She acted the same way she acted on the Saturday night at the villa in Izu.





	For her, it was not something she was consciously aware of. As Miyuki said, it is most natural for her to call him "Onii-sama". From that day, 5 years ago, in the summer, in Okinawa.





	“Go to the bathroom first.”





	“Well.”





	Miyuki advised him to go to the bathroom after Minami left, not because they were arguing with each other, but because she should be doing housework.





	The bath was fully automated, from cleaning to filling it with hot water.





	There was a similar bath in their old house. But in the new house, the automation was a step higher. You could take a bath without doing anything with your own hands. Tatsuya figured this out when he entered the bathroom.





	For a moment Tatsuya seriously thought, whether or not it is necessary to just use the "human washing machine" (Fully automated shower cabin), because this bathroom corresponded to the luxurious layout of these apartments and was equipped with not only a huge bathroom, but also with an ample place to wash. As a result, he decided to wash in the traditional way.





	But even if it was said "Traditional", everything around him was also automated.





	“Shower.”





	After washing his hair it was not necessary to spend time looking at the shower head to touch it. After the voice command, the shower poured hot water.





	When Tatsuya washed away the shampoo and stretched his hand behind the washcloth to wash his body, he felt something from behind, on the other side of the door to the bathroom, it was a sign of human presence.





	He didn't feel any stress. Although his back was to the door, it was clear to him that it was Miyuki, as clearly as if he had seen her right in front of him.





	“Onii-sama.”





	The one that was tense was Miyuki. Her voice was indecisive.





	“What happened?”





	He had absolutely no idea why she was here. No, he didn't understand the reason she talked to him while he was washing.





	“— ... Let me wash your back.”





	(What?)





He had no difficulty in hearing what Miyuki said. But he couldn't understand.





	And he still doesn't understand.





	(Wash your back? Who? by whom?)





	It was very unusual, that Tatsuya got confused by superfluous thoughts.





	“I’ll wash your back.”





	Whether she lost her patience because no answer came, or she saw a chance in the absence of a refusal. Miyuki opened the door to the bathroom. Tatsuya strongly regretted not having locked the door.





	But it was too late. Miyuki’s steps were heard. Tatsuya couldn't look back. Luckily, he was able to quickly get the towel hanging next to him. With help of this he somehow managed to hide the part below the waist.





	It felt like Miyuki was very close. He did not know what she was doing now.





	After thinking ‘what if there was a mirror’, Tatsuya hastily threw away that thought. There was one there, a mirror. Right in front of Tatsuya. However, its surface was covered up by condensation. Tatsuya thought he was lucky for not having the habit of bathing in front of a mirror.





	"Onii-sama, I beg your pardon..."





	Miyuki’s white hand stretched forward to the side of Tatsuya’s head and grabbed a sponge. For an instant Miyuki’s breasts touched his back. Thought Tatsuya was nervous, eventually he was relieved, when he realized that the touch was not bare skin, but from a towel.





	A soaped sponge clung to his back. Not only the sponge, the thin fingers of Miyuki also touched the back.





"Miyuki, why are you so suddenly...?" Tatsuya could no longer keep silent and asked without turning.





	“Am I making you uncomfortable...?”





	“No, no inconvenience.”





	In fact, he was very uncomfortable. But Tatsuya knew he didn't have to say that here.





	“Thank God...”





	Miyuki’s voice, which sounded like she was concealing tears of joy, confirmed that there would be a great amount of trouble if he said something else.





	“— ... But that's probably enough.”





	The fingers touching his back trembled a little.





	“— ... Even if it’s a little, but I want to be there for you.”





	Her voice also trembled with shame.





	“We haven't been together lately... Is that a bad thing?” Miyuki whispered with a sweet voice. She whispered these affectionate words.





	“— ... No.” Tatsuya muttered, as he was wondered if she was being manipulated.





	Maybe it was someone's hobby, but the bath in the new house was 2 times longer than the usual bathrooms.





	In this bathroom, Tatsuya and Miyuki now sat together. ... Back to back.





	Neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki had the courage to turn their face.





	But even if the bath was long, there was not enough space for two people to be in there at the same time. At the moment, Tatsuya is taller than 180 centimeters, and Miyuki is taller than the average women. Moreover, Miyuki had long legs uncharacteristic for Japanese people.





	When they entered the bath, they both took their towels off. Even Tatsuya could not remain calm when the bare skin of their backs touched. And Miyuki’s face was red not just because of the hot water.





	“— ... Onii-sama. How long are you going to stay here?” Miyuki asked, trying to make her voice sound the same as usual.





	“I'm going back to Izu on Sunday night.”





	The voice of Tatsuya, on the contrary, was solid.





	“You can still return to First High... Can't you?”





	“I don't know how the USNA and the New Soviet Union will behave. I think we need to observe the current situation a little bit more.”





	“That’s true...” murmured Miyuki with unconcealed disappointment in her voice. But she didn't say something selfish, like, “Come back soon.”





	“Can I... come visit you again in Izu?”





	“Ofcourse. I'll be happy to see you at any time, unless of course it hurts your studies.”





	"Well, Onii-sama. You sound like a parental guardian?”





	“Isn’t it natural for me as brother to be a guardian?” “Being a fiancée doesn’t change that.





Miyuki unwittingly giggled from this inept joke (?) by Tatsuya.





	“Well, Onii-sama is the only one I can rely on.”





	“Leave it to me.”





	Miyuki’s words contained an unpleasant undertone that she "cannot rely on her father", but Tatsuya pretended not to notice. Such care will only be painful for Miyuki.





	“Sunday... Can I go with you to Shizuku’s house?”





	“Well... It would be better if Miyuki was there.”





	Miyuki was a little surprised, because Tatsuya suddenly spoke in a serious voice.





	“You mean... that I need to attend during your personal conversation with Shizuku’s father?”



	“— I am welcoming the first sponsor of my project, which can become the work of our entire life. I think it will be better if you come too.”





	The work of our whole life. Miyuki could not understand the wrong meaning of these words.





	“All right, Onii-sama...”





	Miyuki enthusiastically nodded and plunged under the water.





	“Miyuki? Are you okay?”





	Tatsuya timidly asked this, because the sensation of Miyuki’s back, which previously had barely touched him, suddenly became like a snug fit. Miyuki tightly leaned her back to Tatsuya.

	If this was intentional, it is already a little bit beyond what can be stopped with a simple smile.





	But what if it wasn't intentional?





	“— ... What do you mean with "OK"...?”





	The voice of Miyuki, answering the question of Tatsuya was somehow softer.





	... That's not good, Tatsuya thought, did Miyuki overheat in the hot water?





	“Miyuki, you better get out of the water already.”





	“— ... that’s true...”





	In response to his warning, Miyuki only nodded and said this with a helpless voice. There was no sign of movement.





	... What to do? Carry the naked Miyuki with his hands was really the last resort.





If he calls for help from Minami, then he must first get out of the bath. In the current situation it will be quite difficult to get out of the bath without touching Miyuki’s body. In addition, he feared that Miyuki could simply go under the water, if he were to remove his support.





	Tatsuya, you might say, was confused.





	As a result, it took him more than a minute before his mind came to the idea of pulling the water out of the bath.





	... Fortunately, on this day neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki caught a cold from sitting in the hot water for too long.





Chapter 5





	Edward Clark came to Japan and was met with a lot of reporters. The fuss was like this not because of a diplomatic visit, but because of a private visit of a famous actor.





	The reason for this was that Edward and Raymond did not even try to hide from the public. Rather, they, on the contrary, tried to raise the hype in the media.





	But they did not give news organizations such services as a press conference or an interview, and as a result, under the protection of the police, they left the airport.





	They went to the Embassy of the USNA. This could not be called strange, because Edward Clark is a member of the State institution. Reporters and journalists knew about this, and most of them were standing behind them, looking at the shadow of the Government of the USNA in the back of Clark.





	At 13:30 they flew from the embassy by helicopter, and in 13:50 arrived on the roof of the Bay Hills tower in Yokohama, where the Kanto branch of the Magic Association is located.





	Tatsuya arrived at the Kanto branch of the Magic Association 5 minutes before the scheduled meeting time. Despite the fact that he was told that Edward Clark was waiting in the waiting room, he showed no haste. Because he was forced to suddenly change his plans just a day ago.





	Initially, Tatsuya intended to let Clark wait about an hour.





	But he still arrived on time... Perhaps he was much more attached to the notion of 'common sense' than he thought himself.





	“Nice to meet you. My name is Shiba Tatsuya.”





Tatsuya, who was brought to the meeting place by a branch employee (but not the one he met yesterday), spoke with Edward in Japanese. Maybe it was childish behavior and to put up some form of resistance.





	“Nice to meet you. My name is Edward Clark.”





	Unexpectedly, Edward greeted him in fluent Japanese.





	“It is a great honor for me to meet you.”





	But Tatsuya did not lose the ability to speak and continued in what is to be considered in this case, an insolent conversation in Japanese. By the way, using his peculiar memory, Tatsuya did "not forget anything that he at least saw or heard once", he almost perfectly mastered not only the English language, but also the languages of most major countries.





	“The same goes for me.”





	Edward, who answered without removing his smile, looked like a perfect liar, which did not fit his mediocre appearance.





	His appearance in a neat suit and beautifully slicked blond hair, together with a standard figure that is not considered thick or thin standing 180 centimeters tall, created the impression that he is not a scientist or engineer, but a senior manager of a sales department. No, not even a private company salesman, but one for a government agency?





	Undoubtedly, his appearance was not the only thing. Although Edward Clark was originally considered an engineer, the role he is now playing is exactly that.





	Although Tatsuya offered a chair, he sat on the couch completely without any hesitation. For the employees of the branch, this was a noticeable concern because of the presumptuous behavior of Tatsuya, but Edward, and for some reason, Raymond did not show a drop of anxiety and sat in front of him.





	“I watched the yesterday press conference. Mr. Shiba, your energy plant project surprised me.”





	Edward was the first to speak





“Thanks. But it is far below "Project Dione" in terms of space and time. I think that this is a great project that I cannot complete in my entire lifetime.”





	“How humble.”





	Tatsuya's words were hard to understand, because it was sarcasm. He implicitly pointed out that the magicians would be cut off from the human community both in time and in space. By the expression on Edward's face it was impossible to determine whether he understood this hint.





	At least, the staff of the Magic Association, present as observers, looked as if they could not understand. If Edward was able to maintain his "Poker Face" after realizing this, then he is undoubtedly a villain.





	“So the Stellar Furnace is a fusion reactor using Gravity Control Type magic? So you designed it for the use at the power plant?”





	“Yes. The completed form will have a design that uses the sea water directly.”





	The expression on Edward's face moved slightly. It proved that he understood the hint of Tatsuya that "Therefore it cannot be used in outer space".





	“— The construction of a power plant using the Stellar Furnace is certainly a significant project for Japan. But the terraforming of Venus is a hope for all mankind. I would like Mr. Shiba, having achieved numerous technological breakthroughs as Taurus Silver, to join the Dione project.”





	Whether Edward had lost his patience, or he had planned so from the beginning, but he suddenly voiced the main requirement.





	“I think, after looking at the yesterday’s press conference, you realized that I'm not Taurus Silver. But I don't have to tell you what you know already.”





	The last sentence of Tatsuya contained the sarcasm "You have studied the question with the help of Hliðskjálf, so you should know." The existence of this backdoor to Echelon III Tatsuya had heard of from Raymond. This fact must also be known by Edward.



	“The glory of Taurus Silver comes from phenomenal achievements in the field of software. In other words, Mr. Shiba is the essence of Taurus Silver.”





	“— Whatever what the software is, without its hardware, it is just plain text. In the relationship between "soft" and "hard" there is no specific claim, which is the main part and which is the secondary.”





	“That's not true. Hardware without a program is just an empty shell.”





	“’However, the actual work is done by equipment.”





	Raymond poked his father in the side with his elbow, and Edward coughed unnaturally. Noticing that, Tatsuya took the conversation in the other direction, he tried to start from the beginning.





	“— the team, called "Taurus Silver", broke up yesterday, so I will refuse the request of their participation. Instead, I would like to ask you here again. Mr. Shiba, would you take part in the Dione project?”





	“I'm sorry, but yesterday I already took responsibility for the project of the energy plant using the Stellar Furnace. If you hadn't asked for Taurus Silver's participation from the very beginning, and had you went to me at once, I had an option to leave the project of the plant to other people... I can only say that this is bad luck. I'm sorry, but you'd better retreat.”





	Tatsuya responded with a clear rejection of Edward Clark's demand right before the staff of the Magic Association.





	After that, a series of similar questions and answers happened between Edward and Tatsuya, but eventually Edward could not convince Tatsuya.





Edward knew that Tatsuya would not agree. But he miscalculated that he could not even put Tatsuya in a disadvantaged position, and take any advantage of him.



	"I knew that the usual methods would not help... But I did not expect such a stubborn stance.”
