(Perhaps they’re dormant. Pretty cautious of them……)

Tatsuya had heard from Pixie that an inactive individual was harder to sense. Were the Kudou engineers aware of that as well? What he had ascertained that night anyway was that searching for the Parasite Dolls storage location like this would be difficult, at least until they became active.

When Minami came to stand next to Tatsuya, the clean-up had all been completed. There was nothing more — nothing productive to be gained from continuing.

Tatsuya ordered Pixie to lock up the vehicle and enter a suspended state, before returning to the hotel with Miyuki and Minami.




August 6th, the second day of the Nine Schools Competition.

The summer morning dawned fast. Even so, the sky at the moment was dark, and had only begun to be tinged with blue. At that middling time, Miyuki was in a dim room sitting at the side of a bed. She was watching the sleeping face of her beloved brother.

No doubt many would have been surprised if they knew, but Tatsuya slept soundly. Miyuki had left the room dark, but turning on the lights wouldn’t have woken him. Even someone in the same room making noise wouldn’t have woken him.

As many would agree with, regardless of the depth of his sleep Tatsuya was a good riser. He would always reliably awake at the time he set for himself. There was no need for an alarm. His biological clock was very accurate. Furthermore, he would still react to any malice or ill-will when asleep. Even if someone sneaked up quieter than the sound of a needle falling, had they the intent to harm him or Miyuki he would immediately awaken. That being said, if someone came close enough even without any ill intent, Tatsuya’s awareness would still open his eyes.

That boundary distance varied according to time and circumstance. Sometimes he wouldn’t awake until close enough to breath on him; other times as soon as someone entered the room. Miyuki thought Tatsuya probably set the boundary himself before he went to sleep.

She guessed that the reason she could get so close was that Tatsuya had fallen asleep before he had set anything.

In this situation where they slept in the same room, the range wherein she would normally move about after waking up should have been set outside the boundary. Yet even after bringing a chair to sit beside him, he showed no signs of waking.

She was not confident about how much further she could get. If she moved closer by even just 10cm, he might wake up. Or she may be able to snuggle up beside him without him opening an eye.

Miyuki wanted to know.

How much closer could she get to her brother? What was a distance he would consider with her present?

(Just how far would Onii-sama allow me go……)

Miyuki suddenly felt a chill. That thought beating within her, however, did not cool. Even in midsummer, the temperature before dawn was cold, and she was in nothing but a nightgown. If she remained as she was, naturally her body would cool down.

At this point Miyuki’s awareness began to wander in a strange direction.

(I wonder if Onii-sama is cold?)

In fact, this was the first time Miyuki had spent a night together with Tatsuya in the same room. Last night — or rather the evening the day before yesterday — she had been so elated she’d simply dropped asleep at some point like a switch being thrown. She’d slept soundly until morning. From yesterday night to this morning, however, she’d been so acutely aware of Tatsuya sleeping next to her that she had awoken countless times. To top it off, even though it wasn’t yet fully dawn, here she was at her brother’s bedside almost like a stalker. The lack of sleep was beginning to melt Miyuki’s self-control.

As if in a fever, Miyuki reached out to Tatsuya. Although it appeared to be a deliberate act, her consciousness was vague; the foremost thought once on her mind, “he might wake up”, no longer present.

Fortunately, Tatsuya did not open his eyes. His forehead was cool against her palm.

(Cold……)

Thinking clearly why that was so — Tatsuya’s body avoided useless metabolism and was cooler to begin with, while Miyuki’s temperature was higher due to the lack of sleep. Miyuki’s thinking however—

(Oh no……I have to warm him)

—had already short-circuited.

(Umm, skin contact is better for situations like these……was it?)

That was more something for times of emergency. Such a thought, which had her head been functioning properly would no doubt have caused her to overheat, had at some point been fixed under the pretext of “nursing” in Miyuki’s mind.

(……I guess stripping is no good after all……)





It seemed a modicum of shame was left to her yet. Completely forgetting about waking him, Miyuki gently snuggled up next to Tatsuya.

(Onii-sama, let Miyuki warm you……)

Already on the border between wakefulness and sleep, Miyuki descended into dreamland while holding on to Tatsuya.



Confirming that Miyuki’s breathing had evened out, Tatsuya opened his closed eyes.

(She’s finally asleep……)

Gently lifting Miyuki’s arm off his chest, Tatsuya slipped out of bed. He had actually been awake when Miyuki stretched out her arm towards him. However, his sister had been in some strange mood (he could tell even without looking), so he had ascertained her condition while pretending to be asleep.

“Fortunately”, he was not overcome by sexual desire even with such a peerless beauty sharing the same bed with him. That did not mean he had not felt anything at all however, and when he thought of sleeping together with his similarly aged sister he couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. The pleasant sensation of Miyuki’s soft body increased the embarrassment several times over. He could no longer sleep any further.

That being said, his sister was competing today, and he couldn’t wake her. Tatsuya didn’t know just when Miyuki had woken up, but there was at least time to sleep a little longer.

Tatsuya dressed roughly without making a sound. Stroking Miyuki’s hair and thinking “sleep well”, Tatsuya breathed in the early morning air and quietly left the room.




“Good morning.”

“Ah, good morning……?”

Azusa had tilted her neck as she replied back to Tatsuya and Miyuki, who had entered the HQ tent bringing in breakfast sandwiches. And for this, the greeting ended up unfinished.

Miyuki, always trailing behind Tatsuya, looked strangely, no, very embarrassed. From Azusa’s view the distance between them was a bit -- basically about 30 cm -- further apart than usual. And Miyuki’s eyes were a bit red at the corners and were slightly directed downwards.

Today, Miyuki would play in the preliminaries for “Ice Pillars Break” solo category. The tactics of First High, aiming for the overall championships, called for grabbing the championship in the Girls’ “Ice Pillars Break”. Computing the events where the maximum number of points was obtainable, and avert crashing out of preliminaries even if the worst were to happen -- that was what the prudent Azusa was thinking. In Miyuki’s case, they couldn’t foresee her losing this event, but now she was giving off a tinge of anxiety.

“What happened?”

Azusa was asking that because she couldn’t shake off that vague feeling of worry.

“What, you ask?”

Asked in return with a forced tone by Tatsuya, she was shut out from asking any more questions.



Results-wise, Miyuki stormed past the preliminaries with a wide lead. Things got a little scary for the boys, but they safely advanced past preliminaries. And as First High executives had dreaded, both boys and girls ended in an ignominious fourth in “Rower and Gunner” solos, gaining no points.

As for the other schools, Seventh High won both boys and girls with 100pts; with 200pts total, they were on the forefront for the 2nd straight day. Third High got 2nd place at both; with 120pts total, they’d slipped past First High for 2nd place overall. Considering the events from tomorrow onward, they could quickly upset Seventh High -- that was what Third High should have been thinking. It should have been a good start for Third High.

However, the dinner scene at Third High was definitely not totally joyous. The second years gathered in a corner were suffused with a heavy atmosphere. The source of their dark clouds was the “Rower and Gunner” ’s solo player Kichijouji, who was unable to grab the championship.

“Kichijouji, even 2nd place isn’t that bad. Don’t let it weigh you down.”

“Yeah. I was 2nd place once, but I paid no heed to that.”

There were even third years, having finished eating and heading for trailer clean-up, cheering him up as they passed by with not much visible effect.

“Who could have seen that Seventh High would pull something like that off……?”

Until then he had been at ease, but the unexpectedly frustrating grumble escaped from Kichijouji’s silent mutterings. If it weren’t for the tableware before him, he would have been falling forward.

He was shocked not because he was defeated that easily, but because of how he was defeated. For someone like Kichijouji, who relied on ingenuity, tactical defeats were an even bigger blow than ability defeats. And he felt today’s defeat was not due to ability, but tactics.

“No use griping about it.”

Those were easy-to-say words, more comforting for all the complaints and grumblings than just falling into dead silence. The second years surrounding Kichijouji were saying this to him at the critical moment.

“That’s right, using the rules to abandon all shooting is unorthodox.”

Seventh High’s tactic was simple and unexpected -- targets hit by mechanical spray-firing were a bonus, and so their magic power was diverted into board control, intent on shortening the time. Rower and Gunner rules stipulated that the fastest team’s time be divided by the number of hits from the team with the most hits to calculate the time per hit. This value was multiplied by the hit count and the resulting product was subtracted from the running time to get the time difference. The team with the smallest time difference would then be chosen as the champion. This meant if the time difference was small the team with the most hits had the advantage; conversely, if there was no big difference in the hit count, the team with the fastest time had the advantage.

Incidentally for the Boy’s solo event, Third High’s Kichijouji had the most hits. This meant that from the results of precision firing and spray-firing, the time difference was too big. A result where brute-forcing won over seeking accuracy was something Kichijouji couldn’t comprehend.

“For the pair event, all teams focused on their hit counts.”

“In truth, that was where First High’s girls trumped over Seventh High.”

“Seventh High might have been blessed with an unexpectedly lucky shot. It has happened before in competitions. Don’t you think so, Masaki?”

The second year boys, in search for a consensus, brought the story to Masaki.

There, all who were consoling Kichijouji, noticed something strange.

Looking back, up to now Masaki hadn’t said even one comforting word to Kichijouji. On the contrary, he hadn’t said a thing since dinner had started. He’d been eating all right, but he gave the impression that his mind was focused on a totally different matter.

“Masaki?”

“Hm? True, the strongest doesn’t always win, but today’s victory will affect Seventh High negatively. First High might have lost to them, but they’ll catch up. Looking at it objectively, I believe it’s far from bad. It was within their calculations.”

It seemed he’d been following them, but for some reason the unnatural feeling couldn’t be shaken off. Both male and female classmates surrounding Kichijouji, in spite of gender, looked at each other.

“I see…you’re right. First High will catch up.”

“Our final objective is the overall championship. We have our work cut out for us starting tomorrow.”

“Dwelling on today’s results is not the best action, you said? I understand, Masaki.”

However, it seemed that Kichijouji got over his shock due to Masaki’s words. On that note the dinner was concluded, and no one bothered asking about Masaki’s unnatural behavior.




Today’s night tea party was scheduled because at the start various work, including CAD tuning, was coming to an end. Tomorrow morning would be “Shield Down” for the Boy’s pair, and the afternoon would be the finals for “Ice Pillars Break” for the Girl’s pair.

Even though he was in charge of Shizuku, who charged past preliminaries, he was serving as engineer for Kirihara, of the Kirihara and Tomitsuka pair. What was more, the day after tomorrow he was taking care of Miyuki’s “Ice Pillars Break” Girl’s solo in the morning and Sawaki’s “Shield Down” Boy’s solo in the afternoon. This was expected to be the busiest two days “especially for Tatsuya at the Nine Schools Competition”.

“Shiba-senpai, voltage checks for Kirihara’s CAD have been completed.”

“Hook them up to the auto-debugger next.”

“Okay.”

With Kent as his assistant, Shizuku’s and Kirihara’s CADs were tuned. This work had strong tinges of inspection rather than tuning, so making Kent the assistant had strong educational impact in guiding him in “orthodox” CAD tuning protocols. However, Kent was unexpectedly skilled and knowledgeable, and he was turning into a capable help for Tatsuya.

Just as the pair’s work appeared to be ending soon, a visitor came for Tatsuya.

“It’s you, Ichijou. What’s up?”

Coming to visit the operations van was Masaki.

“Sorry to visit you at this hour. Do you have a moment?”

“We’re running on schedule. If it’s just for a moment, then it’s fine. Kent, I’m taking a break.”

“Okay, senpai.”

Tatsuya called out to Kent with this, then went along with Masaki to a spot unlit by the van’s headlights.

“You’re entrusting the engineering work to a freshman?”

Masaki, walking alongside and a bit surprised, asked him that.

“I was once a freshman last year.”

However, on hearing Tatsuya’s slightly sarcastic answer, Masaki bitterly smiled, thinking “That’s way too rude.”

“Well then, I believe you’ve come to me only for the Steeplechase case.”

Ignoring Masaki’s relatively friendly façade, Tatsuya went ahead and spilled out what the former would say. Masaki instantly hardened his expression, then changed his mind figuring this was no time for idle chat.

“Yeah, it’s as you’ve said. Somehow, it’s more suspicious than I thought.”

“What did you find out?”

Tatsuya stopped walking and turned towards Masaki. The latter directly took on the former’s inquiry.

“It’s still far from the point where you can say that I’ve found them out. It’s just that the JSDF hardliners appear to be involved with it.”

“Hardliners?”

Tatsuya inquisitively asked back; Masaki immediately found out that Tatsuya didn’t know what “hardliners” was simply referring to.

“Oh, sorry, it’s the anti-Great Asian Alliance hardliners within the JSDF.”

“And they are the ones maneuvering behind the Nine Schools Competition?”

With a little thinking, it was an easy-to-understand plan. The powers that desired a war victory were in a hurry to expand their battle strength by selecting combat-capable magicians. High school students may not be ready fire-power, but even the hardliners wouldn’t be wishing for a war outbreak in a day or two. Besides, if they were to see results in the Nine Schools Competition, it would be easy to guess that this method would be expanded into the university magicians’ athletic meets.

However, house Kudou, no, Kudou Retsu and the hardliners joining together -- to consider it would be a troublesome combination. Tatsuya had heard that Kudou Retsu hated to see magicians used as weapons. It was all rumors, but it had high credibility. Just hearing it from Fujibayashi could be for the benefit of her relatives; such was worth considering, but Kazama, critical of the Ten Master Clans organization, would say pretty much the same thing.

Retsu hated the use of magicians as weapons, and yet he was not denying the use of them as soldiers. Paradoxical, yet that was the very reason there was no way for that old man to use high school students as guinea pigs for such a foul-looking method. For soldiers are not expendable, but are important resources.

“I heard Colonel Sakai wants us high school students to join up the JSDF, bypassing the Ministry of Defense in the process.”

With Masaki continuing to explain, Tatsuya sensed he was getting more and more confused. I see, if the hardliners’ objective is to secure volunteers as ready firepower then confrontations against Kudou Retsu cannot occur. If they are to introduce strong combat-type events, then their plan is crystal clear. Perhaps they’d try to instill to the high school students the exhilarating feelings when battle instincts and destructive urges were unleashed. If that’s the case, it’s no different from trying to increase the number of youth that aim to join as combat magicians.

Even himself as among the youth --- on the contrary, in spite of not being on a youth’s level, Tatsuya thought of it as someone else’s problem. Motivating for combat instincts and destructive urges was a MO even used in Yotsuba training.

Nevertheless, that did not explain the spell to make parasite dolls go on a rampage. The hardliners had to know how much, how far the connections went. Either they were tied to the puppet master or they were mere minor actors.

And then a small problem suddenly popped up within Tatsuya’s mind.

“…You got as far as finding out Colonel Sakai’s name.”

Even the Ichijous probably had a channel of their own into the JSDF. But it should have been no easy task to thoroughly check out the ringleader’s name in a short time. Since it was no public political party, there were no written registries going around about each faction.

Masaki showed a bitter expression at Tatsuya’s monologue on abrupt question.

“Colonel Sakai was my father’s old acquaintance…”

As expected, even Tatsuya was astounded by this “acknowledgement”.

“Ichijou, I didn’t expect that…”

“No, that’s way off! Don’t take it for something else, Shiba!”

As expected, Ichijou openly denied the confusion even when going as far as suggestively taking a stab at it. Even Tatsuya felt relief for the denial. Better that the enemies keep on increasing; if this situation deteriorates any further, he would turn the tables over with bothersome brute force.

(No…… I’d rather end up destroying the steeplechase course. Doesn’t matter what kind of action I have to take if I do that.)

“That they were acquaintances was a matter for the past.”

Masaki was flustered over something else, totally unaware that Tatsuya was thinking of something far more dangerous.

“Colonel Sakai was the top commander in that area during the Sado invasions four years ago.”

(From the start I have nothing to do with the Kudou’s objectives or with the JSDF predictions.)

“Perhaps you knew about it, but a volunteer force with my father as the leader was formed to recover Sado. At the same time father appealed to Colonel Sakai for whether a regiment-sized unit can be dispatched to Niigata, Hokuriku. That time both the government and the JSDF were focused on Okinawa, so the JSDF had intended to send in a battalion once the volunteer army had recovered Sado.”

(Having First High win the Nine Schools Competition is optional. Or at least on the last day’s Steeplechase, Miyuki or Honoka or Shizuku’s championships will wait until after this is over. A premature Nine Schools Competition termination would be a complete humiliation for the Magic Association well into the thesis competition --- but that’s out of my hands.)

“Colonel Sakai answered my father’s appeals. We’re thankful for that even now. At that time a large military force had been virtually thrown our way. We haven’t seen an offensive that big, as my father would say, and I believe so, too.”

(If I hit the ground just below the surface with a Material Burst it would probably be misidentified as explosions from conventional weapons. Targeting for an infinitesimal mass is possible with a “self-made” Third Eye and a “short distance of a few kilometers” and shouldn’t trigger any volcanic ranges. Doing it at the dead of night won’t cause any harm to all students. That leaves persuading Miyuki and to whom to pin this action on… I think.)

“However, just after the first part of the Okinawa battle, the colonel tried to pull a counter-invasion on the New Soviet Union! My father protested, but the colonel would hear none of it. Of course, there’s no way the GHQ would approve such a venture. As a result the counter-invasion didn’t happen, but father was at loggerheads with the colonel until the regiment stood down. From there they quarreled and split up, and they haven’t spoken to each other since.”

(If only there were criminal syndicate members prowling about just like last year to be able to pin this on them. Don’t they have the latent strength to go against the armed forces?)

“I talked to my father yesterday and he was troubled, saying ‘It’s better off without that mutiny nonsense’, but then he said, ‘It’s already other people’s problem so we can do nothing about it’ as he shook his head with finality.”

“Mutiny, you said?”

Tatsuya thought it was totally different from Masaki’s “explanation” thus far. However the single word that would match with his thoughts came flying through his hearing, spontaneously focusing his consciousness onto Masaki’s story.

For Masaki, Tatsuya suddenly giving out a response after silently listening to his explanation (that’s what he saw) was a surprise, and he learned that the word “mutiny” was extreme for a new irritant.

“No, there’s no such thing as suspicions of mutiny against Colonel Sakai’s group. I myself know little of the details, only the ‘It’s only a matter of time for a mutiny to occur’ kind of rumors.”

“That means you don’t have any proof.”

“Y, yeah.”

“Only rumors then.”

“That’s probably the case… Anyway!”

Masaki must have felt this conversation was going in a direction he himself didn’t like. He raised his voice to force the conversation back on track.

“Right now the Ichijous have nothing to do with Colonel Sakai. We did some socializing back then so we have many connections; it was through these connections that we’re aware of this case. Colonel Sakai’s group probably isn’t planning on a mutiny. If they are plotting on something, I believe it’s to gather a considerable number of young magicians and take them into their own faction, then take the battle to the Great Asian Alliance’s shores.”

“That much is enough for a not-so-quiet conversation, …But thank you. I’ll keep those in mind.”

“I, it’s nothing much. I’m investigating for my own sake, no thanks are necessary. Anyway that’s as the situation goes so maybe no one’s making a move on the matches. They might when the tournaments are over. I’ll contact you when I find something. …Whether during the closing party, or by discreetly contacting you.”

“Thanks.”

Tatsuya sent off Masaki, who was taking his leave very hurriedly, with a terse thanks. He knew Masaki’s conjectures were off, and he didn’t intend to drag the latter into the Parasite Dolls matter.

(Hardliners……)

Offered with a definite candidate for a possible scapegoat, Tatsuya instead regained his composure. There was clearly no time even if diversionary tactics were executed. It was less than ten days until match day for Steeplechase Cross-Country, where the parasite doll experiments would be performed. To complete an operation with such a short time interval would be difficult even with Yakumo’s help. It might be possible with Yotsuba help, but it was highly unlikely that Maya would give her support to the partial explosion at Fuji training grounds from the onset.

(It’s so unlike me to be too indecisive over this or that…)

With that, Tatsuya finally recognized that he was wearing out. For now, tonight, Tatsuya ordered himself to drive out the Parasite Doll matter from his mind and relax in a tea session with his younger sister and friends.




Day 3 of the Nine Schools Competition. In the morning the prelims and finals for Shield Down, boys pair, and the finals for Ice pillars break, boys pair, were carried out.

And currently they were in the midst of the third finals match for Shield Down, boys pair. Both First and Third High were tied for first in the finals, so the winner of this match would be the champion of Shield Down boys pair.

Tomitsuka hoisted up his shield, then charged on. The Third High players, aware from the matches thus far that the First High pair were both close-range types, always kept their distance from both Kirihara and Tomitsuka as they fought on. However, the immediately effective remote magic was a high-strength area interference instead of the narrow one created by Tomitsuka -- that’s what the Third High players believed. The truth was they were kept out because of Contact-Type Gram Demolition. In that situation the Third High players lobbed compressed air masses at them.

“Yaaah!”

The shockwave unleashed from Tomitsuka’s shield blew up the compressed air masses into mere “quite strong” winds. It was a composite of Movement-Type Magic “Rest” and a derivative of acceleration magic “Explosion”. It was not the application of radial acceleration to solid masses, but an alteration where the gases directly in contact with the shield face were given acceleration vectors that were perpendicular to the shield face (“Rest” here was meant to restrain against its backlash).

Until Nine Schools Competition training had started, Tomitsuka was unable to learn the air-based attack magic that was popular among Modern Magic users. This magic type mostly required continuous state maintenance of the compressed air until it rushed towards or touched an opponent. For Tomitsuka, unable to control magic beyond the range of his limbs, there was no getting around the fact that there were things he knew he was not good at.

However, being “totally” unable to learn this type of magic was really a problem of the “consciousness”. As long as one was on solid ground, air was everywhere. It existed “where it is within one’s reach”. By only accelerating the air close at hand, long-range control was unnecessary. An example would be Sawaki’s Mach Punch, where it was just a mass of solidified air surrounding the fist pushing out the air in contact with said mass. A spell to accelerate part of a body, no, the entire body into sonic speeds after moving solidified air through sonic speeds without any time lag was a tough proposition, but the remote control for the “process” of firing out a shockwave wouldn’t be used at all.

Tatsuya, serving in a double role as tactical officer, drew up the basic theoretical framework. But, it was through Hirakawa Chiaki’s efforts that an activation sequence for “Blast” that Tomitsuka could master was devised and its CAD optimized.

Chiaki was by nature more proficient in CAD hardware than in software-based activation sequences; she too was proficient in adjusting activation sequences, but she was bad at arranging them. But after hearing from Tomitsuka the concepts behind “Zero Range Blast”, Chiaki, under Professor Jennifer Smith’s daily guidance, grappled with her weakness that was activation sequence arranging, before she succeeded in a rearranged activation sequence for Blast that Tomitsuka could easily handle. One could say that thanks to Chiaki, a zero-ranged Tomitsuka could use Blast.

Kirihara, taking his cue from Tomitsuka blowing away Third High’s attacks, rushed forward. For the ring positions, Tomitsuka was in the middle, the Third High pair were on the edge, and Kirihara was smack between them.

He then lowered his body, kneeling down on one knee as if going down, then struck the ring with his shield.

A beat later the ring shook. Along with the counter vibration due to the ring being struck, magic to create frequency-controlling vibratory waves was fed in.

The shaking was great in the center. However, it had a big psychological impact on the Third High pair, who were standing on the edge. Should they fall out of the ring, they would be eliminated.

Their consciousness focused on their footing, they veered away from Kirihara and Tomitsuka.

The pair didn’t let that opening slip through. Using self-acceleration magic, Tomitsuka rushed forward and past Kirihara, ramming one Third High player with his shield. This time it was his specialty, an Explosion that affected solid bodies.

The other Third High player had no time to realize that his partner had fallen out of the ring as Kirihara had stabbed into that player’s shield with his Shield Edge.

It was a variant of Sonic Blade. The Third High’s shield did not break, it was shattered. And without going for round two, the Shield Down boys pair championship went to First High.

Kirihara took Tomitsuka’s hand and raised them up high. At the ringside staff chairs, Chiaki was clapping her hands with joy. She had an always sour look due to Tatsuya sitting beside her, but it appeared even that was forgotten.




On the third day First High took third for men’s Ice Pillars Break pairs, and first for the women’s. The men’s Shield Down pair took first, but the women’s pair dropped out in the prelims. This was an unexpected result, but they had been grouped with Third High who ended up winning overall. If they had beaten Third High at that match they likely could have ended up winning themselves; so intense was the fight.

But what’s done is done. Third High placed no lower than second for all their events today. The point gap which had been 40 at the end of the second day was now 100. At the dinner table, even the pairs who had won were in a sombre mood.

Instead--

“Shizuku, congratulations on your win!”

“Well, with Shizuku’s abilities that was a given.”

“Yep yep, congrats Shizuku!”

At the evening tea party at Tatsuya’s work vehicle, words of praise to Shizuku flew fast.

“Thanks, everyone.”

No matter how many times, it was still something to be happy for. Shizuku lightly inclined her head.

“Tomorrow is Miyuki’s turn, huh?”

Slightly abashed, but covering it magnificently as always, she turned the focus to Miyuki.

“Yes, I’ll have to do my best, too.”

Without jesting or subtlety, Miyuki replied with a determined smile.

“I think it’d be best if you didn’t think like that. If you focus all your effort into that you might make a pitfall when you least expect it.”

“There’s no way any sort of trap could defeat Miyuki, right? Rather, I think the most important thing is to take care not to make a false start.”

“That’s the biggest pitfall.”

“Jeez……Subaru, Erika, do you really think I would be that careless?”

The reason Subaru and Erika had framed their concerns as jokes was because they couldn’t take the pure atmosphere radiating between Shizuku and Miyuki. With Miyuki’s light protest, the air in the group relaxed again.

“No, it’s not that.”

Subaru answered with a wry smile, and Miyuki likewise pursued no further.

The breezy chatter of the girls melted into the night sky. The number of people attending the parties had increased steadily and things were becoming livelier.

Erika hadn’t come the first day, saying she was “busy”, but had joined since last night as if there were no more problems. Tonight, Satomi Subaru and Akechi Eimi had also come along. The camping table would be full soon. If even more people came, they’d have to find another table and chairs. --All the second year girls were here now, however, so it was probably unlikely any more would turn up.

The first tea party was known to all of the First High team by the next morning. The reason Eimi and Subaru had joined tonight wasn’t because they were reserved about staying the night.

“That said Eimi, it’s good you’re feeling better. Spending a night like that wouldn’t have been very nice.”

“I, I wasn’t sulking! Not at all!”

It wasn’t like she had pressed the issue because she thought it was that big a deal……but seeing Eimi frantically refute it, Subaru heaved a sigh. Based on her attitude, it was questionable if she was really calm, but Subaru had been able to feel that Eimi was troubled.

Subaru and Eimi shared a room. They weren’t as close to Tatsuya’s group as Honoka and Shizuku and since coming to the Nine Schools Competition, outside of matches, they mainly spent their time together. So when Subaru felt that something was bothering Eimi, she herself would feel affected and as a friend, would feel the need to do something.

“What happened?”

Miyuki questioned not Eimi herself, but rather Subaru.

“Nothing at all!”

Her facing reddening, Eimi tried to interfere. But something like that wasn’t able to stop Subaru.

“It’s about Tomitsuka……”

At that answer which Subaru gave with one eye closed and a shrug, Miyuki, Honoka and Shizuku all breathed out with expressions of understanding.

“What did Tomitsuka-kun do?”

Mizuki turned to question Shizuku, who sat next to her. It was Erika who answered, however.

“He was probably flirting with that chick.”

“That chick……?”

“Hirakawa. Hirakawa Chiaki.”

It seemed Mizuki finally understood what Erika was driving at. Still looking unconvinced, however, they turned to Eimi.

“Eimi. It’s Tomitsuka-kun, I’m sure he was just expressing his gratitude.”

Talking about how Tomitsuka and Chiaki had been getting along well during dinner (although Chiaki had her head down most of the time), Honoka spoke words of comfort to Eimi.

“I said there was no problem.”

Eimi persisted in her denial, but it hadn’t been only Honoka who had seen Tomitsuka with Chiaki. Shizuku and Miyuki had seen the same thing. Even if they hadn’t, it was evident with a glance by comparing Subaru and Eimi’s expressions who was more trustworthy here.

“Eimi, Tomitsuka-kun is hopeless.”

“What was that?!”

Displaying such a predictable reaction, it was questionable whether she was really holding something back. That said though, Shizuku’s words had been fairly confrontational--to put it lightly.

“Unlike Tatsuya-san, Tomitsuka-kun is honest-to-god dense. You’d have to clearly spell things out to him.”

After Shizuku elaborated, Eimi was left with a delicate expression. It appeared she wouldn’t go to his defense--or rather, it was a face which conceded there was no defense.

Speaking of delicacy, Tatsuya seemed lost as to what sort of expression to make. Perhaps mercifully, his troubles didn’t last long.

[Master.]

Being telepathically called by Pixie all of a sudden, Tatsuya suppressed his tension and stood up with a neutral expression. He had forbidden Pixie to use telepathy except in one specific scenario. In other words, that situation had occurred.

“Onii-sama?”

“Tatsuya-san?”

“Something sounds off. I’m going to go have a look.”

Leaving Miyuki and Honoka that excuse which could be rather openly interpreted, Tatsuya headed inside the vehicle.



Once inside, Pixie led him over to the map located on the panel at the driver’s seat. In the center of the map the Steeplechase Cross-Country course was laid out, adjoining the military road opposite them.

[I have caught readings of my compatriots in this location.]

“Are the signals still ongoing?”

Scrutinizing the map with a pained expression, Tatsuya contacted Pixie.

[It is. It seems my presence has likewise been compromised.]

“How many?”

[I can identify 16.]

That number coincided with what Tatsuya had gleaned from the former Ninth Institute lab.

[Ah……]

Pixie voiced her feelings reflexively. This sort of personal behavior had become increasingly common lately.

“What is it.”

[I have suddenly lost all contact. I believe they may have gone dormant.]

“Any signs of movement?”

[From what I had intercepted, negative.]

At this stage the Parasite Dolls were yet unable to be developed in military facilities. Tatsuya did not know just how much they had been informed, but this Parasite Doll performance test was most likely a secret. If that was the case, Tatsuya believed it was likely they had been brought in via a mobile lab of some sort.

Tatsuya likewise didn’t know the effective distance it would have to be in to effectively monitor the Parasite Dolls. But for the sake of a performance test, he deduced that they wouldn’t want to be too far when the competition was under way. A position close to the course should therefore be the logical choice. The only problem was--

(If we could determine the location of the Parasite Dolls from here, they likely know the position of Pixie as well……)

That point caused him considerable concern. If Pixie could recognise the Parasite Dolls, the reverse also likely held true. Meaning the fact that the presence of the Parasite Dolls had been compromised was a fact also known to the Kudou experiment team.

If Tatsuya was in their shoes, he would have moved out immediately. That meant finding a different position until the day of the experiment. However, these people were complacently operating under the aegis of Kudou Retsu’s protection, and there was a good chance they wouldn’t be that wary.

(……Didn’t I just decide yesterday that there was nothing to be gained from wondering here. It’s not like there’s much to lose. Let’s go have a look.)

Tatsuya finally decided upon that course of action.



By the time he had collected his equipment and headed back outside, the tea party was already wrapping up.

“Tatsuya-san, see you tomorrow.”

“See you, too, Miyuki.”

“Tatsuya-kun, thanks for the party.”

“Shiba-kun, Miyuki, thanks again~”

“See ya, Tatsuya.”

“Shiba-senpai, good night.”

The lively group of friends (+ one junior) returned to the hotel. Having seen them off, Miyuki cheekily smiled up at Tatsuya.

“Onii-sama, are you heading out?”

“Yeah.”

She knew him so well that there was no point trying to hide anything as he nodded.

“I thought as much, so I got everyone to head back early.”

He had been seen through to a frightening degree, but thinking “this isn’t new”, his disturbance faded before it ever surfaced. Her next words, however, did affect him.

“Onii-sama, please don’t go.”

“Miyuki……what do you mean?”

“No. Rather, Onii-sama. I won’t let you go.”

There was no longer any trace of amusement in her eyes. Rather, they glinted with an unshakeable will.

“Onii-sama, must you really go confront the enemy now? I personally don’t think so.”

“Pixie has detected the enemy’s location. We finally have a lead.”

“Before that. What I’m asking is, why must Onii-sama move to intervene with the experiment of the Kudou.”

It was one of those rare moments Tatsuya was lost for words. From the moment he had received the message from the unknown sender, he had taken that they must be stopped as a given. However, that was only something “he” had thought.

“This may be selfish of me. I haven’t exactly assisted you in this case either, so this may be rather shameless of me as well.”

As she spoke, Miyuki was resolute. Whilst bearing her “shame”, she continued to stand before him.

“You may scold me as much as you like later. But Onii-sama. Before that, please hear me out.”

Tatsuya’s eyes never wavered from Miyuki’s. After declaring he had intended to go face the enemy, he had not moved an inch from before her.

“There is not a single reason why Onii-sama should have to bear responsibility for the Kudou’s plans. Onii-sama does not have any obligation to stop the Parasite Dolls at all.”

Tatsuya himself knew that all too well. He understood it fully.

“Neither should Onii-sama have to bear responsibility for all the competitors in the Steeplechase Cross-Country.”

It was like being struck by a warning stick during meditation. Tatsuya dimly began to realize what his sister wanted to say, and where she was right while he was wrong.

“Onii-sama. I’m about to say something extremely selfish. Something I’m ashamed to even think of.”

There was not a trace of humility or pretentiousness in Miyuki’s tone. Not a single trace of hesitation, either.

“All Onii-sama has to do is protect me. The only one Onii-sama has to be responsible for, is me.”

Only her voice, even now, held a quaver close to tears.

“Whether they’re from First High, or another school altogether, Onii-sama does not have to concern himself with anyone except me!”

Miyuki audibly clenched her teeth. Her downcast bangs hid her tear-stained eyes.

“It’s fine to leave the Parasite Dolls alone until the actual day. If you don’t consider the fact the actual Parasites would only be released, those creatures aren’t even close to worthy of being Onii-sama’s adversaries. It’s fine to just destroy them all on the day. After the competition has ended, I will destroy the spirits themselves.”

Slowly, bit by bit, Miyuki raised her gaze to meet Tatsuya’s. Her eyes were now dry.

“If you will insist on going even then, while impertinent, I will have to stop you by force.”

Now Tatsuya felt dismay in earnest.

He could feel forbidden powers now gathering inside her.

“Stop this, Miyuki! Are you intending to seal my ‘eyes’!? If you do something like that, you’ll end up being unable to use magic as well!”

“I’d have to drop out of the competition tomorrow. In fact I guess I’d have to drop out of First High. But I’d prefer that to seeing Onii-sama force himself on like this!”

For the first time, Miyuki laid herself bare. With a tearful cry, she revealed her true feelings.

“Onii-sama, do you not even realise how much you pile on yourself!? From the morning to the evening you’ve been busy adjusting the competitor’s CADs, then after the matches you consult with the other technical staff and give advice, then teach the juniors late into the night while making preparations for the next day. Taking on the military and the Kudou on top of that……Even for you, Onii-sama, it’s far too much! You’ll end up breaking!”

Tears spilled down from Miyuki’s eyes.

Tatsuya finally realised just how tired he was, and just how exhausted his sister had become worrying for him.

The hesitation which had been clouding him cleared, and he found his heart was now lighter for it.

“There’s no need for that.”

Miyuki looked up dumbfounded at Tatsuya as if she had been struck. The frustration had disappeared from his voice, and in its place a kind gentleness had reappeared.

“I’ll return to our room.”

“Onii-sama……?”

“Miyuki. You are correct. I was wrong.”

Miyuki hadn’t thought she would be able to convince him. As a human being, she had known all along that her brother was in the right. So she wasn’t able to believe that she would be able to change his mind.

“It’s as you say. You’re the only one I have to protect. As long as I can keep you safe, the rest is superfluous. You are all I need.”

Those were the words Miyuki had always wanted to hear, which now filled and bound her heart. As if her earlier eloquence had been a lie, she simply stood looking at Tatsuya in silence. Her gaze, as straightforward as it had been a while before, seemed to be staring into a dream.

“Let’s go back.”

Gently pushing on her shoulders, he began walking the puppet-like Miyuki back to the hotel.

--Behind them, Minami, who had kept to the background during the one man show, followed, keeping her head down to hide her twitching expression.




The morning of the fourth day of competition. In the girls’ Ice Pillars Break solo, Miyuki won both matches of the finals in under one minute.

Her victories were so decisive there was some worry that she might have traumatized her opponents; however, Miyuki did not seem worried over that. And the spectators could not even pay heed to the losers. So charming was Miyuki’s smile that even though they saw that she had forgotten to offer a handshake to her opponents, they became even more entranced with her.

After the noon break was the Ice Pillars Break men’s solo and the Shield Down men’s solo. Tatsuya was in charge of Shield Down. On his way to the side of the ring, Tatsuya met up with Sawaki.

“Shiba-kun, you seem to be much better today.”

He had been taking care of Pillars Break (in short, Miyuki) throughout the morning, but he had washed his face after breakfast.

“I’m that different?”

Simultaneously feeling that the comment was both belated and sudden, Tatsuya questioned Sawaki.

“Ah. The first day, the second day, the third day, I could somehow see that you weren’t concentrating. I didn’t intend to say anything because you were still doing your work properly. I thought you were gripped with worry about something.”

Tatsuya was privately astonished. He had not been gripped by worry but by hesitation; however, he had not intended to let it show in his face. Even now, his friends--Honoka, Shizuku, Mikihiko and the rest as well as Isori and Azusa who were closer to him than Sawaki--each and every one of them had not seemed aware that his condition was off. Perhaps it was because Sawaki wasn’t with him all the time so he was aware of a small change. Nevertheless, Sawaki’s observation skills were terrifying.

“You look refreshed today. So I felt like mentioning it.”

“Although I wasn’t aware of it myself, fatigue might have been piling up on me. Yesterday, I had the first good night’s sleep in a while that was enough to revive my constitution.”

As an excuse, it wasn’t a clever one, but it wasn’t an unnatural one. Thinking that he wouldn’t have accepted it himself, Tatsuya made that answer to Sawaki.

“That’s great. Keep yourself fired up, Shiba-kun.”

However, Sawaki didn’t show any doubts. He was simply team spirited. He didn’t consider anything else and remained focused on the upcoming match.




The pace of Tatsuya’s recovery and First High putting pressure on the leader was the same.

Day 4. First High’s results: Ice Pillars Break-- Male Solo-3rd place, Female Solo-1st place. Shield Down--Male Solo 1st place, Female Solo-1st place. Third High started the day with a 100 point lead that shrunk to 60 points.

First High’s advance continued even in the Newcomers tournament. On the 1st day of the newcomers tournament, both male and female placed 1st in Row and Gunner. Tatsuya was the engineer in charge of the boys along with Kent. He guided his kouhai pair to a victorious smashing of Seventh High. The female winner, Kasumi, displayed a “there’s nothing to it” victorious expression from the middle of the winners’ podium.

The second day of the newcomers tournament was the finals for Ice Pillars Break and Shield Down. The boys finished off in 3rd place in Shield Down, but the girls won magnificently. Tatsuya was the engineer in charge of Minami, but he really didn’t have a lot to do that day.

The boys got another 3rd in Ice Pillars Break and the girls were again victorious. Izumi had completely dominated Ice Pillars Break. When Izumi returned to First High’s tent, her whole face---somehow seemed to smile at Miyuki, drowning her with unwholesome desire, but for once Miyuki was willing to be kind enough to be embraced as a body pillow (she just stood) until Izumi was satisfied.

And on the Third day of the Newcomers tournament.

“………This was inevitable.”

“It was to be expected. Ayako is unrivaled at Mirage Bat…… Even I would be no match for her.”

The finals for the main tournaments’ Mirage Bat were two days away; today, Tatsuya, who was off tomorrow, was watching the finals of the newcomers’ Mirage Bat from the stands. Only one of First High’s athletes fought her way into the finals.

Actually, at the athlete selection stage, it had been suggested that either Izumi or Kasumi take part in the flower of the girls’ competition, Mirage Bat. The idea had a lot of supporters; however, Tatsuya had strongly opposed it, and Kasumi ended up in Row and Gunner and Izumi was assigned to Ice Pillars Break.

Tatsuya’s stated premises for opposing either of the pair taking part in Mirage Bat, which were “Kasumi has an inclination for Row and Gunner” and “Izumi has an aptitude for Ice Pillars Break”, were not lies. The distinctive trait of the Saegusa clan’s magicians was “a lack of weak areas”, which could also be stated as having an aptitude for every kind of magic. Mayumi was rather unusual for having a clear specialty.

However, his true reason was “Neither could win against Ayako”.

Ayako’s specialized magic was “Ultimate Scattering”, a convergence type magic that diffused vapour, energy, etc. evenly to the point where they could barely be recognized anymore, The Ultimate Scatter spell had no direct relationship with Mirage Bat. However, Ayako had another magic which was just as much a specialty of hers as “Ultimate Scattering”.

That was “Mock Teleportation”. The magic consisted of cloaking herself or perhaps a partner in a cocoon of air, quelling inertia, and moving instantly through a vacuum tube made of air.

The vacuum tube would be viewed as an obstacle to other athletes in Mirage Bat, so she couldn’t use it like that. However, if the sequences of Mock Teleportation were downgraded, then the magic allowed her to jump faster than the eye could follow by continually creating gusts of air.

Even the use of flying magic could not compete with her speed. Mock Teleportation was extremely inferior to Flying magic in terms of potential movement distance. However, that did not pose a problem in Mirage Bat. The only possible way to win against Ayako in this event would be to cause the ball of light to disappear before she could find it.

As Tatsuya and Miyuki expected, the newcomers tournament’s Mirage Bat developed into a display of Ayako piling up her score alone. Their First High kouhai was putting up a good fight. She would probably manage to take second place.

However, that was as far as she could go. Because even now, the point spread was widening.

The winner of the newcomers tournament’s Mirage Bat was Fourth High’s Kuroba Ayako. The final results were 2nd place-First High, 3rd place-Third High, and 4th place-Fifth High.

Final day of the newcomers tournament, Monolith Code. Here again it was a difficult struggle but First High put up a good fight.

This year, Monolith Code was a round robin league; both the main and newcomers tournament used the six arenas over two days. Each team would have eight matches over ten rounds (in short, each team would sit out and rest two times).

Second day, ninth round. Lead by Shippou Takuma, First High’s team had won all of the six matches they had been in so far. They had narrowly defeated the team that they had regarded as their greatest rival before the competition started, Third High, in the match before their last match, so a victorious mood ran through the rookie team. However, they had seen Third High lose to Fourth High before their eyes in the last match. This riveted Takuma and the others’ attention like their heads had been soaked in cold water.

“That guy is incredible. What the heck is his name?”

Leo asked Tatsuya, who was in the stands, not the support staff area.

“Kuroba. Kuroba Fumiya.”

“Kuroba, of course…”

Mikihiko, who was observing from the stands as well, mumbled as if hesitant to speak out.

First High was facing Fourth High in the final match. Unfortunately, it looked like First High was in a pinch.

Dotted with big rocks, “the rock stage” of Monolith Code imitated a karst-like area. The one defending First High’s monolith, which was erected on a bridge, was Shippou Takuma. Unexpectedly, he had volunteered to take on defense; until now, all the enemies had been repulsed. In their victory over Third High also, Takuma had annihilated the offense, which could be said to be one of the main reasons they won.

Despite that, Takuma was being pressed by Fumiya. Like Minamoto no Yoshitsune[11], Fumiya jumped from boulder to boulder, not allowing Takuma to lock him in his sights. And Fumiya was taking aim at Takuma with his gun-shaped CAD in midair, assaulting Takuma with an intangible attack.

The Outer-System Magic, “Phantom Blow”.

Tatsuya had used it in last year’s newcomers tournament, but compared to Tatsuya’s, this was much more powerful. It was not just that; Fumiya was using more than “Phantom Blow”. Under the cover of the flashier magic, another magic was being slipped in, “Direct Pain”, Fumiya’s specialty; a magic he alone could use to imprint pain directly into his opponent’s mind.

He had stepped it down so that any magicians in the stands wouldn’t notice, but even so, one blow was enough to take out Takuma’s mind. As a result, people were unaware of “Direct Pain” and only saw a powerful “Phantom Blow”.

Naturally, being mistaken about the source of such power did not change the effect. The accumulated effect of the pain in his mind was clearly keeping Takuma from concentrating.

A decreased ability to concentrate decreased the force of one’s magic. A decline in concentration decreased the force of the magic; there was a direct correlation between concentration and the success rate of magic. Takuma was trying to attack with “Stone Shower”---a magic that used herd control to spray an opponent with a concentration of pebbles---in order to stop Fumiya’s movements.

Stones whirled in Takuma’s vicinity.

However, they did not attack Fumiya; they sprinkled down directly in front of the boulder Fumiya was standing on. Direct Pain was being emitted from Fumiya’s hand concealed by Phantom Blow.

With all three members of First High’s team being KO’d by Fumiya, Fourth High’s victory was assured.

The curtain closed on the newcomers tournament ended with Fourth High’s victory in Monolith Code. However, First High secured second place and was graced with overall first place in the newcomers tournament.

As a result, with the conclusion of the newcomers tournament, the difference between Third High, which was in 1st place, and First High, in 2nd place, was 5 points. The actions of the first years had turned it back to a battle between Third High and First High for victory.




The ninth day of the Nine Schools Competition. The fight moved from the newcomers tournament back to the main tournament. And under the starry sky, the finals for Mirage Bat, also known as Fairy Dance, were being held.

First High was sending two people, Honoka and Subaru, to the final. Honoka’s engineer was Tatsuya; Subaru’s engineer was Azusa. While both were second years, this was a calculated move to overcome Third High in one blow. With Third High only having one athlete advance to the final, the strategy had already half succeeded. In preparation of attaining the other half of the strategy’s goal, Tatsuya and Azusa had gone all out. The rest was up to the athletes.

Wearing a uniform that was fitted to her entire body that had a light lime base tone, Honoka was a little embarrassed to be standing in front of Tatsuya. Even though she knew it was an athletic uniform, it was a decidedly embarrassing to be exposed in this manner to a male in close quarters.

“Absolutely nothing wrong. Do you feel there is anything wrong with your own condition?”

It was inevitable that after checking on the CAD tuning, Tatsuya would slowly and thoroughly examine Honoka’s body. One’s “eyes” being more reliable than a machine at observation was something that was limited to him.

“No…nothing. I’m fine.”

Honoka was so embarrassed she answered in a small voice. She had a greater reason to be embarrassed than simply being seen by a member of the opposite sex. Tatsuya understood that as well but had to pretend nothing was wrong because he understood.

Should I leave her alone for a while before the event so she can concentrate on the match……Tatsuya considered and just as he was about to bring it up to Honoka.

“Excuse me, Shiba-kun.”

Subaru had entered from the next booth where Azusa was doing her final check.

“Do you need something?”

His words were unfriendly, but his tone of voice was not all that hostile. Tatsuya was only asking; after all, even though they were members of the same team, Mirage Bat was an individual match. To visit an athlete this close to the match, although it could not be called thoughtless, was not normal.

“I thought I would give my regards to Shiba-kun.”

“Regards? To me?”

“That’s right, to you.”

Subaru agreed with an insolent air. Naturally, this was her usual manner. Last year, well it doesn’t matter now.

“I will be victorious in this match. Sorry Tatsuya, but the myth of your invincibility ends today.”

However, this arrogant speech wasn’t like Subaru.

The “myth of his invincibility” referred to the fact that last year, athletes in his charge had only lost to each other, and so far this had continued to be true this year. Even at this year’s Nine Schools Competition, “Row and Gunner”-pair-Eimi; “Ice Pillars Break”-pair-Shizuku and solo-Miyuki; “Shield Down”-pair-Kirihara and Solo-Sawaki; newcomers tournament’s Row and Gunner- male division and newcomers tournaments’ Shield Down- female division had all secured victory.

“I am not the one who won.”

However, Tatsuya did not misconstrue that as his own achievement. Eimi, Shizuku, Miyuki, Kirihara, Sawaki, and Minami. They were all athletes that would have won without his help. Tatsuya considered that he himself had been the lucky one. His response was accompanied by an exchange of ironic smiles; he wasn’t letting it go to his head.

“Although, that is true. Athletes in Shiba-kun’s charge don’t lose. I will smash this myth.”

However, this record put pressure on their opponents, so viewed objectively, there was no problem. This brazen attitude so unlike the usual Subaru was probably to get rid of that pressure.

To be honest, her attitude was unpleasant. However, that being said, to Tatsuya, Subaru was another athlete of his team. It would be unwise to make a clumsy response and increase the volume of pressure on her.

“Is that so?”

Other than that short reply, Tatsuya made no response.

After watching Subaru leave, when Tatsuya returned his attention to Honoka, she was all fired up for some reason.

“Tatsuya-san!”

Her eyes no longer showed any shame. Instead, they burned with competitive spirit.

“I am going to go all out. I’m going for it and winning! I will defend Tatsuya-san’s no loss record!”

Worry that she might be so fired up that she self-destructed arose. However, in Honoka’s case, trying to sooth her might have the opposite effect. Tatsuya had learned her personality well during their year’s acquaintance.

“I see. I’ll depend on you.”

Rather, it was better in times like this to fire her up even more.

“Yes!”

Honoka happily agreed, her fighting spirit coming out in a bright smile.

Finals of Mirage Bat.

The results were Honoka-winner and Subaru-2nd place. The Third High athlete managed to get 3rd place, but Third High had only acquired 20 points compared to First High’s 80.

In the overall rankings, First High was finally standing at the top.




“Up to this point, I thought we might not make it, but somehow we managed to get to this point this year as well.”

The students of First High seated for dinner radiated relief rather than joy. It was the 10th day of the NSC, and First High had widened its lead on Third High to 95 points with their win in Monolith Code.

Momentarily, it had been a huge 100 point lead, but it was still a complete turnaround.

“Yoshida was today’s MVP. He really did well for us.”

The one praising Mikihiko was his Monolith Code teammate who had the name of Minakami Carey; he was a third year who, due to being of Indian and British descent, possessed unusual coloring: blonde hair with black skin.

“No……it wasn’t just my efforts. I simply followed the lead of my senpais.”

As he was speaking, Mikihiko eyed Tatsuya, who was a little bit away from him and surrounded by girls.

“I was also helped by Tatsuya……”

“That’s right. Shiba has made great efforts as an engineer for us again this year. Hey, Shiba!”

Carey made multiple beckoning gestures to Tatsuya who had looked up in their direction. Tatsuya stood up holding the tray he was eating from. As he watched Tatsuya leave the flowery group of girls that included his sister, Miyuki, to come to this table full of males, Mikihiko might have had the malicious thought, “He’s the only one making good memories……” but no one could be sure.

“Well, sit.”

Those words were from the head of the men’s table, Sawaki. Tatsuya did not dare to disobey---well, since he had brought his tray, he probably never intended to disobey---and indicated his understanding by sitting down.

“Good work, today.”

“No, I wasn’t able to do enough work yesterday, so, since I was able to recover a little.”

Tatsuya had not hastily decided to take charge of Mikihiko. From the start, Tatsuya was supposed to be looking after Mikihiko’s CAD. Although it was from the start, there had been the possibility that the Mirage Bat and Monolith Code events would overlap. If it had come to that, Tatsuya would have had to choose between being the engineer in charge of Honoka or Mikihiko.

“Nothing could be done about yesterday. We’re well aware of that.”

Everyone here understood that, but Hattori was the one who dared to speak up, demonstrating his “honest but hardheaded” personality.

“It’s as he said. Besides, there were almost no problems with the work you showed us from you taking it a little easy yesterday. Make no mistake, you contributed to today’s victory.”

“With this, we should get the combined total victory. So you can show your face to your senpais.”

After Sawaki, Carey spoke up with a relieved look. This, his third year, was the first time he had been chosen as a representative, so the traditions were probably putting a lot of unnecessary pressure on him.

From Tatsuya’s point of view, this was a very hasty pronouncement. There was still the possibility of a huge reversal in the point spread with tomorrow’s Steeplechase Cross-Country.

However, Tatsuya didn’t point that out. It would be correct to say it was because he didn’t care about the rankings, number of points or the overall victory.

He wanted to make tomorrow’s event end safely.

No, he would crush anything that interfered with tomorrow’s event publicly finishing safely.

That was what he was thinking as he made an inoffensive reply.




After dinner, Tatsuya went to the hotel’s observation lounge. The moon hadn’t yet risen but the sky was clear. The outline of Mount Fuji was carelessly displayed by the starlight. From this viewpoint, the darkness resembled that of hell. From the balcony, he looked down on the course for tomorrow’s Steeplechase event, which was a man-made forest with violent traps concealed within.

“How is it going?”

He questioned the doll in the shape of a girl right next to him.

[No response. I surmise that they are kept in a sleep-like state.]

The one that answered was the entity housed within the doll. A London conference had assigned it the name of parasite; Tatsuya and his friends called the pushion information entity, Pixie.

“As expected, there is nothing to be done but wait for tomorrow, hmm.”

Despair oozed from Tatsuya’s monologue. But no sign of depression was etched on his face. Tatsuya genuinely wished to know the whereabouts of the main actor in tomorrow’s planned experiment, the gynoids with parasites implanted in them, the Parasite Dolls, make no mistake. However, when he had Pixie accompany him here, he had not actually expected her to be able to find them. In the first place, if all he intended Pixie to do was find the Parasite Dolls, then it would not have been necessary to climb to a high place. After all, since Pixie and the Parasite Dolls were essentially the same type of existence, if both were active then they both would be aware of each other.

Since the night Miyuki had persuaded him to let her bet her own existence as a magician, Tatsuya had thrown away the notion of stopping the Kudou clan’s experiment that might add to the danger to the magic high school students himself. As the mysterious informer might have expected, he would decide what to do on the actual day then and there; in short, tomorrow. ---That the mysterious informer had not expected him to stop the experiment before it started was clear from the lack of a delivery of supplemental information.

Tatsuya’s coming to look at the site of tomorrow’s drama, which was submerged in darkness, was nothing more than a whim. The daring might say he came up here to divert himself a little from the anger he felt over being pushed this way and that by the Kudou clan and the mysterious informer.

“Watch tomorrow!” for that reason. It was simple to take advantage of Pixie’s ability to detect the Parasite Dolls.

“Tatsuya-kun.”

The observation lounge did not have a do not enter sign. However, so close to midnight, he had not expected anyone other than himself to be weird enough to come the topmost balcony, which had neither lighting nor effective air conditioning.

“Master, have you come to cool off?”

Naturally, in terms of being wierd, Yakumo was at a much higher level than he was. ……Thought Tatsuya. When he had been thinking “as weird as himself”, he hadn’t been thinking of Yakumo.

“I, well, something like that. The night wind does feel better than air conditioning. But, doesn’t that young lady over there need you for something? I think it’s about time you speak with her.”

As Yakumo spoke, he didn’t go as far as shrugging his shoulders, but somehow he conveyed the impression that he had to Tatsuya on the balcony.

He could see a shadow within the darkness. The woman was older than him, but she was still regarded by the world as young. She was giving off a different aura than she usually did; her beautiful face wasn’t wearing its usual amusement, probably due to the stern “at the end of her rope” look she was wearing instead.

“As I thought, the message was from you, Lieutenant.”

Without a preamble, just as if they had already been in the middle of a conversation, Tatsuya spoke to her, making Fujibayashi’s face lighten a bit.

“How did you know?”

“It was a matter of probability. If I consider who among my acquaintances has that kind of high level technical skill, your name heads the list.”

“What if it was someone you didn’t know?”

“It’s futile to consider that possibility.”

“Oh…”

Even though she relaxed slightly, Fujibayashi’s face was still stiff. Was it from tension or was it from guilt, or was it due to a completely different reason……Tatsuya was not yet equipped with the discernment to determine.

First, he had to ask about the things he didn’t know; there was no other way to a resolution. Therefore, Tatsuya asked without reserve or hesitation.

“Did you give me that warning on the road to the former Lab 9? What were you trying to get me to do?”

“What…… I wonder what it was that I wanted you to do, Tatsuya-kun……”

Tatsuya held her eyes with a piercing gaze. But he found nothing he could use to determine that she was trying to fool him.

“Tatsuya-kun, shouldn’t we change venues?”

Without magic to prevent eavesdropping or watching, they couldn’t speak about it safely; the information was surely on that level.

”You’re right…”

In this matter, it was not completely clear whether either Fujibayashi or the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion were allies. There was no sign of it being a trap, but he did not think the matter was as serious as that.

“You won’t mind if Master sits in?”

“Okay.”

“Eh, I don’t care.”

“Understood, I’ll leave it to you.” After securing the two’s agreement, Tatsuya gave his approval to Fujibayashi’s plan.

The place that Fujibayashi took Tatsuya and Yakumo was inside an RV that was similar to the one Tatsuya was using as a work van. The parking lot was different from the one allotted for use by the Nine Schools Competition. It was a little apart from the other unoccupied parked cars in the lot.

[Master, I can’t sense any wireless transmission waves.]

With the help of Ushiyama and the rest, Pixie’s sensors had been stretched to the limits they could go without impairing her 3H body.

“Tatsuya-kun, here. Sensei, please take a seat as well.”

After the pair took the offered seat on the simple sofa, Fujibayashi gave Pixie a slightly pensive look, but nevertheless, she went to the RV’s kitchen without saying anything.

She probably hadn’t intended to waste any time from the beginning. She came back carrying a tray with three glasses full of black liquid. She placed the glasses on the table and ignored the standing Pixie as she sat down opposite the two males.

“First, is it fine if I explain things in sequential order?”

Without proffering the drinks, Fujibayashi abruptly spoke to Tatsuya. The informal manner of speaking was presenting the stance that “Tatsuya was a friend she was speaking to”.

“You’re right. Before we get into discussing things, there are some things I would like confirmed.”

Seemingly without any wariness, Tatsuya sipped from the glass. His throat was a little dry.

“Okay.”

Fujibayashi was unsurprised at the way Tatsuya drank the ice coffee she had set out without any qualms. She was aware that Tatsuya probably knew more about the ingredients in the drink than she did; anyway, poison wouldn’t affect him more than an instant.

“First is the matter of why you didn’t leak any supplemental information to me as a follow up to your initial message. Were you under surveillance, Lieutenant?”

Right off the bat, he asked what she didn’t want him to ask, thought Fujibayashi. However, there wasn’t any reason not to answer now.

“Yes.”

“Then, secondly. Is this contact at the urging of Major Kazama and Saeki-kakka. Or at the urging of Kudou-kakka.”

“……It is my commanding officer’s order. I am not under the surveillance of my grandfather.”

By no surveillance, it might mean that this forced experiment of the Kudou clan had nothing to do with Fujibayashi Kyouko, or it might mean that they could trust her so much that there was no need for surveillance.

“May I ask a question, Ojou-san of the Fujibayashi.”

Before Tatsuya could ask that, Yakumo butted in from his side. Addressing her as “Ojou-san of the Fujibayashi” didn’t seem proper, at least to Tatsuya. However, Fujibayashi didn’t seem to mind; she smiled serenely as she nodded to Yakumo.

“Yes, go ahead.”

“What might be the stance of the Fujibayashi clan?”

However, she wasn’t able to maintain her poker face at the content of the question. She wasn’t scowling because she hadn’t wanted to be asked that question, but because she herself was anxious about the stance of the Fujibayashi clan.

“Neutral.”

“They are truly against it but they can’t oppose what the Kudou clan is doing covertly, is that what you mean?”

“………”

“The honored wife of the actual head of the Fujibayashi clan is the daughter of the actual head of the Kudou clan. That connection with the magicians who bear the ‘9’ whom the traditionalists hold hostility to places them at the side of the magicians of the ‘9’ although they are Ancient Magicians. If they break away from the Kudou clan, the Fujibayashi clan could be standing alone in Japanese magic society……is that it?”

Fujibayashi’s face lost all expression, probably to keep them from reading what was going on in her head. However, it goes without saying that the disappearance of her smile made this attempt a total failure.

“But that is not what I wish you to tell me. What does the Fujibayashi clan feel about the usage of the occultists from the continent?”

Yakumo’s eyes did not reflect his usual amusement. Instead, they bore a sharp gleam.

“If they did such a thing, I believe the Fujibayashi clan wouldn’t like it. Regarding the refugees Makoto-ojiue welcomed into the former Lab 9, Father has repeatedly urged him to change his mind.”

The gleam in Yakumo’s eyes faltered as Fujibayashi gave a clear reply to the query. Certainly, the Fujibayashi clan and the Kudou clan had become allies with the marriage. Nevertheless, both those who had chosen to take the path of bridging the gap between “those who bore the number 9” and “the Traditionalists” who clung to the antagonism felt welcoming that another nation’s occultists, who were searching for cracks in their defenses, was dangerous.

“Certainly, the refugee occultists possessed useful spells. By using the spells they provided, the volume of psion consumption by the Parasite Dolls slightly. However, despite that, both Father and I think it is a mistake.”

“Pardon me, Master, but we should go over the sequence of events.”

With Tatsuya’s interruption, the tension that had arisen between Yakumo and Fujibayashi was quelled. Yakumo’s face returned to its default faint emotionless smile.

“Lieutenant Fujibayashi.”

On the other hand, faced with Tatsuya’s treacherous fake smile, Fujibayashi started to feel an entirely different kind of tension.

“This incident has been incredibly frustrating and irritating for me. Although I am aware of what you would call the outline of the plan to test a new weapon on magic high school students at the Nine Schools Competition, I don’t have a very good grasp on what is actually happening behind the scenes. Well, the truth is I don’t really understand. For some reason, my informant has been stingy with information.”

“Uuumm…… Tatsuya-kun, about that.”

Fujibayashi’s face stiffened slightly but distinctly.

Perhaps seeing that satisfied him, and Tatsuya’s sadistic smile disappeared.

“If you just ignore the intentions of those maneuvering behind the scenes, it’s not all that complex.”

Miyuki had already made Tatsuya aware of that, but since it was irrelevant, he didn’t mention it.

“First, the anti-Asian Alliance hardliners in our nation’s military changed the events in the Nine Schools Competition to more combat oriented ones.”

No one disagreed with Tatsuya’s point.

“Next, the Kudou clan took advantage of this to plan a performance test of the Parasite Dolls.”

“Grandfather proposed it, but Uncle seems to have opposed it at first.”

“So then, the one who decided to use the refugee occultists was Kudou-kakka?”

“……No, that was Uncle.”

“Is that so. Let’s call the person manipulating things behind the scenes through the refugee occultists who the current head of the Kudou clan took in X for now. X is aiming for the Parasite Dolls to go out of control and cause injuries and deaths among the athletes of the Nine Schools Competition. They might not intend to go as far as killing anyone, but they may intend to cause injuries that end their lives as magicians. X’s ultimate goal might be decreasing our nation’s military power by cutting off the supply of magicians who will become soldiers. Because an increase in the military power of Japan would be a hindrance to him.”

“Yes, that is our take as well. Hence my reason for being here.”

“……What do you mean?”

Fujibayashi did not avert her eyes from Tatsuya’s gaze, which was laced with distrust and suspicion.

“Tatsuya-kun. We request your cooperation in stopping the Parasite Dolls from going out of control.”

She did not rise up to bow, as she sat on the sofa with both knees together with her hands on top of them, but Fujibayashi bowed her head down low. She did not call him “Special Officer” but “Tatsuya-kun”.

“Cooperation?”

“Yes, this is not an order. This request is not something in the realm of what we can command you to do as your duty. Therefore, this is a plea for your cooperation.”

Fujibayashi raised her head and got up from the sofa. Reading her unspoken intentions, Tatsuya got up as well. Fujibayashi moved in front of a box that looked like a coffin that could snugly hold a fully grown man. In front of Tatsuya who was by her side, she opened the lid.

Perhaps there was a spring in the hinge, as after the lid was opened only slightly, it sprang open. Inside was an ultramarine mobile suit---it resembled a bulky work jumpsuit.

“While the Parasite Dolls’ performance test is unofficial, it is still a project entrusted to the Kudou clan of the Ten master clans by our nation’s military. If we interfere in that, it could lead to discord within the military or a private war with the Ten Master Clans.”

“You want me to become an illegal agent of destruction.”

Tatsuya’s voice was cold and hard. It was inevitable after all; it was implied that they wouldn’t protect him if his identity was revealed. It could be called a mild response considering what had just been said.

“Even if you put it that way, I believe that nothing else can be done.”

Tatsuya’s gaze became even sharper; however, Fujibayashi met his gaze firmly. It might have been a bluff, but she did not appear to flinch.

“……Fine.”

Their short face off ended with Tatsuya giving in. He had intended to finish off the Parasite Dolls himself from the start. He was actually grateful that he was able to use the new type of mobile suit augmented with stealth functions.

“Thank you. You can use this car as you wish. Here is the key.” Tatsuya accepted the wireless control box from Fujibayashi.

“When you are done with it, please press this button. After five minutes, the contents will self-destruct.”

Fujibayashi indicated a corner of the wall. There was a red button surrounded by yellow and black caution stripes.

“What do I do with the mobile suit? I don’t think it will be destroyed with the van’s contents.”

“If you place it in the box, it can be completely destroyed. Finish off the experiment.”

“Roger.”

Tatsuya directed a nod toward Fujibayashi while he looked at the “self-destruct button” with subdued eyes, and murmured that as if speaking to himself.

“Since this is in part a personal request, I will surely have you repay this favor someday.”

As Tatsuya’s statement made her cheeks lose color, Fujibayashi said farewell and left like she was fleeing. Since she offloaded the mobile suit and the RV onto Tatsuya, she was probably going to the hotel. Yakumo insisted on escorting her, “just in case”, as was proper. As their shadows merged with the big square one, Yakumo engaged Fujibayashi in conversation.




“Ojou-san, was that actually Kazama-kun’s order?”

“……What do you mean by that? Besides, could you please stop calling me ‘Ojou-san’?”

Fujibayashi answered with a stiff face without looking in Yakumo’s direction.

“Forgive my rudeness. Fujibayashi-san, I’ve been thinking. I would say that there was no need to make Tatsuya-kun do that. Make no mistake, by that I mean the Parasite Dolls won’t actually go out of control, will they?”

“Are you saying I lied?”

“Since lying is part of your job……”

Yakumo barked that out in a tone that was both condemning and comforting.

“The weapon has a failsafe device. I don’t believe Kudou Retsu is the type of man who would neglect that…… By the way, did you know, Fujibayashi-san? Even Mikkyou has spells for manipulating a doll like a puppet. Novitiate monks whose virtue is insufficient to summon genuine Gohou Doushi[12] use them to create fake Gohou Doushi.”

“No……I didn’t know, but I theorized it.”

Fujibayashi responded to the sudden switch of topic by speaking with deliberation. Even though she peeped with sidelong glances to see what kind of face Yakumo was making, she completely failed to read his expression. Fujibayashi understood that the reason for that was not completely due to hostility.

“Before I came here, I went to the ‘Main Temple’, which I haven’t done in a while. I questioned an expert in this area. He claimed that he had already achieved the ability to call Gohou Doushi and was no longer using fakes, but-”

It seemed like some kind of trouble had occurred at that meeting. Yakumo made a reminiscing smile.

“No matter what type of practitioner, they would not neglect to define the rules of offense and defense. And, when a puppet broke those defined rules, a punishment would be incurred. A sealing so that the puppet could not inflict more harm. The seal spell is said to be part of the enslavement spell.”

Yakumo turned. His eyes were empty, his mouth had burst into a crescent shape. The face was so like a possessed doll that Fujibayashi let out a scream. ---No, she wasn’t able to scream.

In an instant, Fujibayashi had succumbed to Yakumo’s spell.

“The Parasite Dolls have the same type of spell installed, right? For instance, a prohibition about attacking non-combatants. If they didn’t, they couldn’t be deployed as an autonomous weapon.”

“…It is as you say.”

Fujibayashi had lost neither her mind nor her will.

“Even if the occultists want the Parasite Dolls to attack high school students, the foundation spell wouldn’t allow it. The instant they became violent, the control sequence would switch to a sealing sequence and seal the parasite.”

“That is what I heard.”

However, she didn’t hide it. She didn’t lie.

“If the Parasite Dolls are let loose, is the spell keeping them emplaced inside the mechanical doll cancelled, and does the procedure to emplace the free parasite into the mechanical doll have to be repeated. Does this not affect the fact that the parasite is attached to the mechanical doll?”

“I don’t know.”

“I see……the testing hasn’t proceeded that far.”

Yakumo took his eyes off Fujibayashi.

Exhausted, Fujibayashi dropped down to her knees.

Yakumo called out to the darkness.

“It seems like that is how it is, Kazama-kun. Did you know?”

The shadows created the silhouette of a person. As it proceeded from the parking lot, under the scattered lights of the hotel the form of Kazama appeared.

“Why are you here?”

“You say that there wasn’t a need for Tatsuya-kun to cross that dangerous bridge.”

“No, I don’t know that.”

Perhaps he didn’t think his monitoring had been directly observed; Kazama paid no attention to Fujibayashi who was looking up at his own face with terror and answered his teacher’s question with a ---visibly---pensive look.

“You didn’t hear it from this Ojou-san?”

“Yes.”

Kazama was also one of the users of ancient magic. He should also have general knowledge of puppet spells. There should be no way that he wasn’t aware of the embedded failsafe. For him not to have asked about that…

“Hmmmm…… Apparently, there is a reason you want Tatsuya-kun to run amok.”

“You didn’t tell Tatsuya-kun either, Master, right?”

By answering the question with a question, he indirectly agreed with Yakumo’s words.

“I have no reason to defend the decision, but the commander of the brigade is unaware of this. Although the Major General is well informed in how to use magic, this is only regarding modern magic; she is the same as any amateur regarding ancient magic.”

“I thought you were her advisor……”

“Why didn’t you stop us, Master?”

Apparently, this policy of not answering was inconvenient for Kazama.

“Because it would be unpleasant to stop him.”

That didn’t particularly matter to Yakumo. He hadn’t intended to condemn Kazama from the start.

“Fujibayashi-san, about our earlier conversation.”

If he thought there was no danger, he would have told Tatsuya that.

“That is the truth in general. There is a possibility that it will not work so well in this matter.”

Yakumo, who had decided to divorce himself from the world, was seeing this incident to the end because he feared the impact this incident would have on the world.

“……For what reason?”

“Kudou Retsu is probably locked in the same mindset. Not just him, all the old guys at the former Lab 9 are assured by this bit of common sense.”

He himself was just about the age to be called an old guy, but Yakumo referred to the retired generation of “9” as old guys.

“You should have received a detailed report from Tatsuya-kun regarding the nature of Parasites.”

Kazama and Fujibayashi nodded in answer to the question without a word.

“Parasites came to our world from a different direction via a small hole in the dimension wall and they are overwhelmed by strong pure thought. They fuse with the owner of that strong pure thought and that strong pure thought serves as an impetus.”

Yakumo repeated the phrase “strong pure thought” many times. Fujibayashi was quicker to catch his meaning.

“Good grief… What is Kokonoe-sensei trying to say!?”

“Strong pure thought. It would be strange if the grounds were not soaked in the desire to win the Nine Schools Competition on the final day of competition, right?”

“If the binding spell on the parasite malfunctions……?”

Kazama groaned out the question.

“Maybe they go out of control. Maybe they don’t go out of control. I believe that we should at least decide that we cannot let them go out of control.”

Yakumo’s reply was terribly irresponsible and sincere.

“And when the out of control Parasite Doll is ultimately destroyed, the released parasite might possess a youth emitting a pure thought.”

Neither Kazama nor Fujibayashi could deny the possibility of the worst case scenario Yakumo outlined. If Kudou Retsu himself were here, he probably would have turned pale and been unable to refute it.

“Therefore, I think it is correct to let Tatsuya-kun have that battlesuit. Tatsuya can deal a unilateral defeat to the parasite dolls. The military might also give up the foolish plan of using demons as you are thinking, Kazama-kun. So I will keep this matter under wraps for you. I want you to repay me by telling me something.”

In repayment for not informing Saeki that Kazama was concealing information from her, Yakumo wanted information.

“About what?”

“Who sent those mainland occultists to the Kudou clan?”

Even though he was asked, Kazama didn’t know. Fujibayashi was the one who answered Yakumo’s question.

“……A Chinese merchant of Yokohama, a young man named Zhou Gongjin.”

“Zhou Gongjin of Yokohama. I have been hearing that name a lot lately.”

“You know of him, Master?”

Yakumo did not answer Kazama’s question.

“Well, I asked about what I wanted to know, so I’ll go. As promised, I will keep quiet about your concealment of information and covert actions.”

Yakumo took a single step off the lighted path. That was all it took for him to disappear.

After Yakumo left, Fujibayashi finally got up.

“Major, well…”

“Go, Lieutenant. We do not want Tatsuya to see us.”

After cutting off whatever Fujibayashi had started to say, Kazama walked to the hotel.

Perhaps, she thought, if they followed Yakumo, it would become obvious to Tatsuya; Fujibayashi obediently trailed after Kazama, who hadn’t punished her.

“Lieutenant.”

Without turning around to confirm she was there, Kazama spoke to Fujibayashi.

“Yes, Major.”

“Were you deceived by Kudou-kakka as well, Lieutenant?”

“Wha?”

Although she continued walking, for a moment she seemed about to trip.

“About the possibility of the Parasite Dolls going out of control. However, you thought it was an impossibility, Lieutenant. Right?”

“Ah, yes.”

She didn’t immediately understand what Kazama wanted to say, so she had to make a guess.

“I did not confirm the information myself, sir. I was in a situation where I couldn’t report immediately. I only brought in false information. Consequently, I prevented the giving of mistaken orders.”

Kazama was offering to overlook Fujibayashi cleaving to Kudou’s side.

“Good work, Lieutenant.”

“Thank you, don’t mention it.”

Fujibayashi stopped and bowed deeply to Kazama’s back as he continued on without stopping.





Chapter 7




August 15th, the eleventh day of the Nine Schools Competition. As with the ten days prior, Tatsuya rose from bed at the same time, had breakfast within First High’s tent as usual, and commenced the final inspections on the contestants he was responsible for like always.

Today’s schedule included the Women’s Steeple Chase starting at 9:30am, with the Men’s Steeple Chase scheduled for 2:00pm. The registration deadline was set for 5:00pm the previous day. Originally, the assumption was that schools that scored too low on the hierarchy would not attend, but the end result was such that most of the male and female contestants in their second year or beyond had all registered to attend.

Tatsuya was responsible for all the female students in Year 2 as well as Mikihiko for a total of 6 individuals. Working for six may sound strenuous, but setting aside the technicians from Year 1, it was originally intended for six people to cover the CADs for 24 people. It just so happened that everything was concentrated in the morning, as the average workload was not especially great.

He started working at 7:30am and was finished with maintenance by 9:00am. Furthermore, during this time, he was not continuously working since there was sufficient time for rest in between, though he may appear taxed in the eyes of any bystander. Hattori and Isori occasionally asked him “You OK?” Thus, no one suspected anything was amiss when Tatsuya wished to retire and rest without watching the women’s competition upon completing his duties.

A competition like the Steeple Chase was wholly unobservable from the exterior. Each contestant must wear a signal transmitter to determine if they stepped out of bounds, and this also served to declare who was running around in circles. Still, even if miniature flying cameras were deployed, they wouldn’t be able to capture anything from above due to the dense foliage, therefore leaving various cameras to capture approaching contestants as the only recourse.

Owing to this reason, many individuals planned from the very onset to observe the action from the widescreens set within the conference gala. Although such coldhearted individuals were the decisive minority among the contestants and auxiliaries, Tatsuya’s situation enabled him to depart with only compassionate gazes seeing him off.

At 9:20am, the eyes of the representatives and audience members were gathered at the starting line. Each of the nine schools had dispatched a dozen people for a grand total of 108 young women gathered together and neatly lined up on the starting line. The women’s outdoor gear was accompanied by a wide vest along with sturdy boots, gloves, and various protective gear such as a hat that served as a helmet, protective goggles, joint protectors, etc. While the equipment seemed extraneous, this was essentially work clothes that clung to the body. With so many people gathered in one place, there was a particularly dazzling effect.

Unbeknownst to anyone, Tatsuya slipped from the hotel and walked towards the parking lot. This was not the parking lot opened for use during the Nine Schools Competition, but the military one instead. No one would be the wiser if he was only approaching it.

Tatsuya rendezvoused with Pixie en route. She was dressed in a plain dress with loose long sleeves that was properly collared, comfortable around the waist that fell to ankle length, leaving no trace of the body uncovered. Fortunately, in this era, wearing such a getup even at the height of summer was nothing to raise an eyebrow over.

Tatsuya had called Pixie over because he would require her to locate the Parasites, but Pixie was accompanied by another young woman whom Tatsuya had not specifically summoned.

“Minami, why are you here?”

Upon being questioned, Minami bowed to Tatsuya before answering.

“This is an order from Miyuki-sama.”

“Miyuki?”

Just now, Minami said “Miyuki-sama” instead of “Miyuki nee-sama”. This was no slip of the tongue; this was clearly intentional. In other words, Minami was not currently acting in the capacity of his underclassman at First High nor as her alias as a cousin, but as a servant of the Yotsuba. Tatsuya correctly divined Minami’s purpose.

“Miyuki-sama declared that she herself would not be able to provide any assistance to Tatsuya-sama during the competition and therefore wishes this one to assist you.”

Minami’s expression was steadier than normal. This was not the tender, albeit somewhat bemused, expression of a younger girl, but the face of a Magician able to stand on her own two feet. Setting aside whether this was her own choice or not, this was actually what Minami should appear like.

Tatsuya discarded any notion of dismissing her. She wished for her strength to be of use, and in truth there were areas she could be of assistance. The idea that “what can a 15-year old young girl do……” was far too arrogant, and, technically speaking, Tatsuya himself was nothing more than a 17-year old youth.

“Understood. Follow me.”

“Acknowledged.”

Minami never seemed to consider that she might be asked to leave.

Within the car Fujibayashi provided, Tatsuya changed into the Mobile Armor (Minami kept her back to him while he was changing) before inquiring with Pixie regarding the Parasites’ location.

“There.”

The instant Pixie’s thought reached Tatsuya, 16 spots of light also flashed on the map in front of Tatsuya’s eyes. Using the transmitter on board the engineering vehicle, Pixie had sent the intelligence directly to the screen contained within the visor of the Mobile Armor’s helmet. Tatsuya had already made sure that Pixie and the engineering vehicle were synchronized the night before.

The number of the lights coincided with the amount Tatsuya had verified in Nara as well as the number that Pixie detected several days ago. This implied that Pixie had a complete grasp of the Parasites’ location. Currently, “they” were arrayed in a formation within the stadium’s center near the finish line. With Miyuki in the lead (Tatsuya judged that Miyuki would be leading the pack), the quickest scenario…… Or likely the worst scenario would have her encountering the first Parasite.

(--In that event, the first Parasite must be defeated within 8 minutes and the entire troop eradicated within 20 minutes.)

Tatsuya allotted this much buffer time before turning to Minami.

“Minami, remain here and prevent outside interference.”

“Understood.”

Minami obediently inclined her head when receiving Tatsuya’s order. That being said, her eyes betrayed her own opinions on that order. Minami was likely assuming Tatsuya desired for her to stay beyond the line of fire. This was a dangerous misunderstanding.

“Minami, Pixie has the vital role of locking onto the Parasites’ location.”

“Yes.”

She seemed to understand that point, which is why this time she answered in the affirmative with a slightly confused air.

“However, that does not mean this identification is one-sided.”

Minami’s eyes widened in comprehension.

“The Parasites can also detect Pixie. Just as Pixie knows that dolls have sensed her, those commanding the dolls will also realize that I am locking on to them through Pixie.”

Tatsuya gazed deeply into Minami’s eyes as if to carve his warning within the bottom of her heart.

“This vehicle may come under attack.”

“Understood.”

Minami nodded with a mildly anxious expression on her face.




At 9:29am, Tatsuya released a real IFF signal for the Fuji Instructional Team and departed from the engineering vehicle at the same time, advancing towards the practice forest for the Steeple Chase under the guise of the Mobile Armor.

9:30am. At the starting line, podiums that stood two meters tall were installed every 100 meters. From these podiums, 41 shots rang out together to announce the start of the Steeple Chase.

The majority of the contestants proceeded cautiously, with the detachment from Eighth High entering the forestry first. This was likely because they were Eighth High students who frequented outdoor training and proudly believed that “forests were their home territory”.

As if unwilling to concede defeat, a Year 3 student from Third High sprinted forward. Though this was probably because she had yielded to the burning anxiety to beat First High, this spirited young woman sprang into the air – and promptly fell into a trap.



Tatsuya switched off his IFF signal and pushed the Mobile Armor’s stealth capabilities to the maximum threshold while he concealed himself near the outer edges of the practice forest. He charged into the Steeple Chase’s arena the moment he heard the signal round go off.

The Parasite Dolls were scattered across the latter half of the 4 kilometer long route. Seeing this formation, Tatsuya seemed to feel that they were trying to bait him in. This was practically saying “if you can take down all the dolls before the contestants arrive, then bring it”. It appeared that he was dancing to someone else’s tune.

(It would be arrogant in the extreme to think oneself to be omniscient, but at least this facilitates matters for me.)

Even if his speculation was correct, he was planning on accepting this gambit. Regardless of what this faceless manipulator was planning, Tatsuya’s objectives would be fulfilled once he incapacitated the Parasite Dolls and eliminated any threat they could possibly pose towards Miyuki.

Tatsuya kept himself close to the ground using Flying-Type Magic and proceeded towards the closest Parasite Doll in the formation.




Shortly after she began running, the audience stands placed before a giant video screen ahead of her erupted into laughter.

Generally speaking, there were three rules governing the Steeple Chase. First, obstructing other players was prohibited. Being caught hampering other players would result in immediate disqualification. Nonetheless, since vision was so limited for the reasons stated above, the chances of being caught affecting other players was quite low, to the level that “being caught was purely luck”. Thus, rather than calling this rule a punishment, it would be more appropriate to call this an unwritten agreement.

Second, there was no leaving the area proper for the 4 kilometer race. Each contestant wore a transmitter that was connected to the Fuji Practice Facility’s independent GPS, allowing the competition committee to verify where each contestant was moving. In addition, each contestant would be aware of where they were currently located. The visor would offer assistance when prompted by the contestant to display the map and current position. Even if they were about to step out of bounds, an audible warning would also be emitted from the helmet.

Third, leaping to branch height was forbidden. Fundamentally, moving across the trees would no longer be Steeple Chase. This was the logic as “What is the fastest way to pass through a maze?” “Vaulting over the walls.”

The GPS system was also three dimensional, so this could also calculate how high the contestants were jumping. Still, the only certain method to see if the jump exceeded the height of the branches would be through long distance observation devices, so here a simpler solution was used instead.

Strictly speaking, nets were set all over the place as obstacles. Accidentally leaping too high would result in being ensnared within the nets even before reaching the branches – as can be seen on the screen right now.

The one who ran afoul this was the contestant from Third High, the female student who took the bronze during Mirage Bat. The fact that these details were also broadcasted was surely a distressing outcome for the person in question, but was definitely highly entertaining. Just as a butterfly was caught within a spider’s web, this strangely alluring scene was likely one of the reasons behind this as well.

This scene was not only played on this screen, but was broadcast over the network. The version displayed to the entire country was subject to approval from the JSDF, so only the network within the base could view this right now. On the other hand, so long as they were within the base, anyone would be able to see this even if they were at a distance. Across the forest, this scene was also being shown on the opposite side of the hotel within the conference room for high ranking officers in the command center.

“An unidentified Magician has breached the perimeter.”

“Do you have a visual?”

“Negative. There are no cameras available.”

“A recording will serve. Put it on at once.”

“Yes, sir!”

However, the soldiers’ attention was not drawn to the piteous state of the female student, but another person altogether.

The scene playing out over the network in real time was from an altogether different location in the practice forest.

Short clips were being shown of a group of green figures passing through the trees of the dark forestry.

“Can this be brightened further?”

“Yes, adjusting now.”

The recording brightened as it was switched to an overhead cast. Within the picture that had grown brighter but allowed the outlines to blur, this man wore a uniform superficially similar to their own, but varied in a multitude of areas with their own Flying-Type combat uniforms.

“That is the new Mobile Armor developed by General Saeki’s faction.”

“Then, that intelligence turned out to be accurate?”

Robotic weaponry capable of using magic was a plan first proposed by the Kudou Family.

However, the magic weaponry being field tested during the current Nine Schools Competition was a plan formally sanctioned by the JSDF, but a covert operation in its entirety. Even hampering this experiment would not be subject to discipline by high command.

Opposing the Kudou Family – or rather Kudou Retsu himself, there was a high possibility that General Saeki would secretly dispatch saboteurs to thwart this experiment, so there were very few individuals within this unit who honestly harbored doubts regarding this intelligence. That being said, their shock at witnessing an incident where the Japanese military risked internal strife could be excused given their perspective.

These were no selfish men. Had their goal been mere prosperity, these men had far eclectic methods.

Clearly knowing that this would only do them a disservice – that is, hampering their advancement, they stuck to their guns in an act of pure patriotism. They believed that peace for Japan demanded a decisive victory over the Great Asian Alliance, and for this, they needed to convince the droves. They solemnly vowed that should persuasion fail, they would be forced into silence.

Nevertheless, this process ultimately needed to be realized through peaceful methods. The JSDF was there to protect Japanese interests, so inciting internal conflict was damaging national interests and hereby betraying their oaths. Thus, they had decided that regardless of the outcome, they would never resort to weaponry. They were hawkish towards the Great Asian Alliance and not towards their own countrymen. That was their stance.

From their perspective, that General Saeki was willing to commit magical assets to obstruct the opposing faction was utterly astounding. This experiment carried a certain degree of danger, so there were elements within their group who felt that they should avoid the women’s competition at the very least and only conduct the experiment during the men’s competition.

Yet, faced with their rivals’ uncompromising stance at ruining this experiment, they could not help but feel that this was unacceptable even if no one was injured here – though the reverse was also true.

“Contact Kudou’s engineer. Allow them to retaliate, but be careful not to kill the saboteur.”

“Understood, I will order them to avoid dealing lethal injuries.”

Colonel Sakai, leader of the hawks, was concerned for the safety of the Magician who was being used as a pawn. Although they stood in opposition to one another, he still gave the order to prevent the loss of a valuable asset to this country’s future.

Kudou Makoto, head of the Kudou Family, frowned when he received the message coming from the experiment site.

“Forbidden from killing the saboteur……”

He had no objection to the order “do not kill the Magician”. However, when the time came, these people would use “you are all Magicians” as a reason to push Magicians to the brink of extinction. Clearly, innovating Parasite Dolls was to avoid this coming to pass, yet here was a Magician trying to obstruct this plan. Makoto could not suppress the boiling rage he felt towards this Magician.

“Switch the dolls’ target to the invader and order them to act in concert to subdue the invader. Allow them to use any attack so long as they do not endanger human lives.”

Makoto vented his irritation on the chief developer standing on the opposite side of the line, though in actuality he was ranting at the Magician who was seeking to hamper them.

“Makoto-sama appears to be in a rage.”

The chief developer who had just been chewed out wore an impatient expression as he turned to his assistant.

“However, it’s true that he is getting in the way.”

The screen showed a Magician wearing a teal-colored Flying-Type combat uniform leisurely avoiding the trees as he sped directly towards the Parasite Dolls. It appeared that this Magician possessed some sort of ability to accurately pinpoint the location of the Parasite Dolls.

“Set the invader as the target and set the objective to capture. In addition, the dolls had detected something, correct? That must be this guy’s assistant, so send someone to bring them in.”

The chief developer ordered the Parasite Dolls to capture Tatsuya while also giving orders to the private militia of the Kudou Family temporarily under his command to capture Pixie.




Tatsuya stamped the group as he came rushing through the trees to stand before the Parasite Doll and aimed his CAD at the body. Nevertheless, in the next second, Tatsuya was flung backwards by a powerful force before he could use any magic.

(This guy…… Is very fast!)

Without crashing to the ground, he unexpectedly swam through the air for a moment. Using this brief moment that was rendered longer due to accelerated cognition, Tatsuya began analyzing the reason why his opponent got the jump on him.

During the exchange earlier, the Parasite Doll’s reaction was noticeably higher than Tatsuya’s own. From detecting the other’s silhouette to beginning to move, this speed was beyond human capability. This gave the impression that this was not only the superb information processing speed of an electronic brain, but a machine built specifically for combat.

At first glance, the slender body boasted little in way of power. Yet, in Tatsuya’s recollection, this body garbed in female combat fatigues contained both might and agility that belied its outer appearance.

There was no helmet or cap because the short strands of hair were sensory devices for air and water currents. There were no goggles or protective visors because the eyes were designed to protect the light sensory devices within. The skin was composed of bulletproof composite material, the joints were rotors capable of swift motion, all coupled with a cooler beauty than even Pixie. This feminine robot was……

(Female Combat Servitors. So those were still being developed?)

Combat Servitors were designed to be combat weaponry to replace infantry. Prototypes were already capable of using infantry weapons and researching was ongoing, although their primary utilization was for security missions in high risk areas. Tatsuya, however, had heard that development had ground to a halt. The reason being that rather than adhering to the human form, it was far more efficient to succumb to non-humanoid automatic gun turrets with more fluid mechanics.

Female combat servitors crafted for military use specialized in processing intelligence during combat. Nevertheless, this still should not result in Tatsuya being hit before activating his own magic.

There was no specific reaction point; the entire body was pushed away by pressure exerted evenly everywhere. This was the familiar feeling of being subjected to an attack through Acceleration-Type Magic. Also, this acute speed and coarse Eidos design –

(Single Systematic Acceleration-Type – No, this is telekinesis!)

Tatsuya adjusted his posture in mid-air to brace for impact.

His back collided solidly with a tree trunk. The shock was less than expected, though that was probably the armor cushioning the blow. This level of damage did not necessitate the use of “Restoration”.

Tatsuya slid down the tree trunk to the floor and immediately adopted a fighting stance. Acceding to his own instincts, Tatsuya sprang off the floor. There was no chance to use magic, no time even for Flash Cast, so he could only use psions to enhance his muscles to explode away from his original position.

His assessment was rewarded by successfully avoiding the attack. A crater appeared at his earlier position as if a gigantic mallet had hammered home.

(This is also Gravity-Type Magic. This sort of primitive Magic Sequence is definitely telekinesis.)

The Parasite he fought against last winter also possessed similar inclinations. That entity did not use “magic”, but relied on “ESP”. Magicians abandoned “ESP” and received “magic” in exchange. Overwhelming speed was sacrificed for versatility, accuracy, and stability. Tatsuya felt that the opponent before him took this to the logical extreme.





(So, the Parasites rely on ESP as weapons!)

Maybe this was the entity’s specialty, but optimism was something to be wary of.

Tatsuya operated the keys to his beloved Trident and set Gram Dispersal for Loop Casting. Decomposition Magic “Gram Dispersal” could destroy the structure of the Magic Sequence and reduce it to the original state of psion noise. The CAD activated and wrote the Eidos that differed from typical Magic Sequences into Tatsuya’s specialized Magic Calculation Area.

The Parasite Doll’s body released psion light. Tatsuya’s eyes did not perceive the light itself, but the structure and Magic Sequence formed by aforementioned light.

The Eidos fired at his legs contained the meaning “contort”.

Before the “meaning” transformed into “phenomenon”, Tatsuya’s spell decomposed the Eidos itself.

The entity inhabiting the doll betrayed an aura of shock. Perhaps, this astonishment was not only felt by the doll but the operator as well, thus causing the doll’s reaction to unexplainably falter. Forget following up; the enemy hadn’t even activated the defensive field that was fired at Tatsuya during their first exchange.

At the same time that Tatsuya reached this conclusion, he was drawing closer to the servitor. Adjusting his body at the same speed that his thoughts were flowing, Tatsuya let fly his fist towards the doll’s chest.

An oscillation wave composed of psions permeated the female servitor through the palm, temporarily canceling the psion barrier enveloping the Parasite’s main body and revealing the spell that connected the Parasite and the doll.

(Replication complete.)

Tatsuya used the concept of Restoration Magic to replicate the spell.

Recovering, the Parasite Doll struck back with superhuman force with its servitor arms, but Tatsuya had already finished his replication objective and jumped to one side, dodging the doll’s attack.

Although it held the advantage since its physical body was that of a servitor, the human body held the advantage for manipulating its physical form thanks to endless practice.

He would use martial arts to surpass machinery, human determination to overcome demonic power.

Gathering strength into his left hand, he held it into a fist as he moved it to waist height. Tatsuya visualized a miniscule sphere being compressed within his hand.

He released the fist, as if pushing out the compressed sphere, without decreasing the distance and directly reached out his palm towards the Parasite Doll from just beyond arm length.

Tatsuya sent an anti-Parasite psion pellet flying towards the electronic brain of the Parasite Doll.

After stripping the psion defense barrier, the Parasite’s pushion Eidos was left completely naked.

The spell connecting the Parasite and the female servitor had also been disrupted, so the Parasite was about to be set free.

If this was a human body, psions would not be concentrated only in the bosom area. Furthermore, the human body shuts down the moment all psions are lost and could no longer sustain the Parasite as a host. However, the female servitor was a machine whose performance would not be affected by psion loss and could continue acting as the Parasite’s host if psions were replenished.

Tatsuya used Restoration Magic.

This magic replicated a previous Eidos and imprinted the replicated Eidos onto the current one.

This was not restricted to physical properties of the Eidos. So long as this Eidos was crafted with psions, this method could be used to replicate and imprint.

Tatsuya pumped a minute amount of psions into the female servitor and used the replicated loyalty spell to once again reconnect the Parasite and the female servitor. The recording of the Magic Sequence was a perfect replication, so theoretically it would remain loyal to the Kudou Family. Nevertheless, the Parasite’s compatibility values would not change, so there needed to be enough psions in order to move.

Tatsuya’s assessment was right on the money.

After receiving the minimal amount of psions, instead of turning into a composite of psions and pushions and flying away, the Parasite went into hibernation within the female servitor.




Of the Kudou Family’s private militia that was dispatched to bring in Minami and Pixie on board the engineering vehicle, everyone was capable of using modern magic. The kinetic force at their disposal easily rivaled that of infantry rocket launchers.

The goal of the former 9th Research Facility was to develop modern magic that had incorporated elements from Ancient Magic. Yet, besides the three families inaugurated with the “9” in their name, none of the Magicians from the former 9th Research Facility were able to ingrain magic that took advantage of the specialties from Ancient Magic. This was exactly what exasperated the traditionalists, as all of their traditional elements were incorporated into new magic instead.

The Magicians who came from the former 9th Research Facility but failed to obtain the number “9” possessed power that was in no way inferior to their modern counterparts. By all rights, the magic at their disposal should be more than sufficient to subjugate a medium-sized vehicle and abduct the passengers within.

However, given the results, they never even touched the engineering vehicle Pixie was on.

From the very onset, one second after they consciously prepared to attack, the engineering vehicle seemed to recognize the harbingers of their magic through the active psions and was enveloped within a powerful magic barrier.

Reading the signs of magic invocation prior to the actual casting was a high level skill only wielded by well-trained Magicians. However, the strength and accuracy of the magic barrier that extended along the vehicle was even more astounding.

Simply touching the barrier would not result in pain, numbness, or injury.

They would only be pushed back with equal and opposite force.

Trying to alter the phenomena surrounding the car would also be rejected by the strength of the interference emanating from the barrier.

Attempts to heat, shake, or apply pressure to the vehicle along with the barrier were met with no success.

Even when they enhanced their bodies with Fortification and Acceleration-Type magic and charged, the vehicle remained stolid.

As a last gasp, they opened fire even knowing that this would bring security down on their heads, but to no avail.

As expected, there was no way to completely obscure the fact that gunshots were fired even with silencers. The security forces were closing in, so the private militia was forced into ignominious retreat.

Needless to say, the magic barrier that had repelled the Kudou private militia was erected by Minami.

The “Sakura Series” were genetically engineered to emphasize defensive barriers with reverse kinetic properties. As a member of the second generation, she inherited the outstanding capabilities of the first generation and was able to erect barriers with additional stability.

Minami had undergone combat training within the Yotsuba Family, so detecting the signs of an oncoming magical attack was a matter of course for her. That was because the Magicians who served the Yotsuba Family adopted “detecting the signs of an oncoming magical attack as a matter of course” as their standard.

In addition, the capabilities of Minami’s magic barrier would not be found wanting against even descendants of the Ten Master Clans or maybe even eclipsed them. While she was unable to perform the Juumonji Family’s high class barrier magic such as “Phalanx”, as a single layer of defense, her magic barrier was the equal of Katsuto’s own barrier.

Her defensive barrier was proof against impact from tank shells or the heat from missiles, so mere bullets from handguns or automatic rifles stood no chance.




Tatsuya prudently used his “eyes” to examine the servitor that had fallen to the ground and verified that it had entered hibernation.

He had stumbled upon this method last night. After overhearing Yakumo, Kazama and Fujibayashi’s conversation, he came up with the idea of taking full advantage of Kudou’s spellwork.

His information detection ability could also be used on sound. Words would also be recorded as Eidos within the idea dimension.

Maybe, Yakumo had sought this outcome from the very beginning, but even if it were otherwise – in other words, even if this was completely eavesdropping, Tatsuya did not give a fig. His personality was not “adorable” enough to feel guilty over something like this.

The spells to create these dolls would obviously contain the spells to restrain these dolls.

In short, the spells that created these dolls were one and the same with the spells restraining these dolls.

Through Pixie, Tatsuya found out where on the dolls the Parasites were hosted. Since they utilized the female form for both combat and household chores, emulating real human beings to be precise, their fundamental design should be roughly similar.

Four limbs, motors installed at the waist and neck, sensory devices plugged into the head, fuel batteries set within the torso, and the electronic brain sitting where the human heart would be. Given that the Parasite dwelt in the electronic brain, it stood to reason the spell linking the Parasite and the female servitor would also be there – at least that was the conjecture, with no chance to test this hypothesis before taking to the field. Still, Tatsuya seemed to have come out ahead on this gamble.

“Pixie, how far is the closest Parasite Doll?”

[Two Parasite Dolls are on approach vectors from your 4 o’clock and 7 o’clock positions. Master, please be careful.]

The last part of that almost caused Tatsuya to chuckle. This was not out of shock, but rather out of warmth. Somehow, Pixie seemed to be growing more lifelike…… Though perhaps it could be said that she was becoming more and more like Honoka.

Parasites – independent Eidos from humans.

Perhaps they held the key to unlocking true understanding of the “spirit”.




Five minutes after taking off, the players were largely congregated together by school.

At four kilometers in width, the track was broad enough on sheer area alone, with thick trees separating areas into smaller zones. Even if all 108 people ran equidistant to one another, they would probably quickly lose sight of one another.

Furthermore, this was the first time this event had ever been held, so there was no telling what the initial zone would look like or where the traps might be. Contestants being disqualified along the way could only be chalked up as unavoidable circumstances, so players from each school set mutual checkpoints along the way. It was perfectly understandable that each school adopted this strategy.

Each of the schools were approximately tied at this point. Up until this point, each school was essentially groping their way forward. Despite this, they had still traversed a quarter of the track up until this point, their speed wholly thanks to the magic at their call.

Now that each school had more or less gotten a grasp of the course, acceleration was imminent.

“Kanon, you’re charging too fast!”

Tomoko voiced her complaint at the accelerating Kanon, but Kanon never slowed down her footsteps.

“I’ve gotten a rough grasp for the feel of this course! My guess is that the other schools are about the same!”

Kanon shouted without bothering to turn her head. Her unstated rebuttal was “we don’t have a chance if we don’t pick up the pace”.

“Everyone, it’s OK! Don’t push yourselves too hard!”

She added that phrase before continuing to speed up, repeatedly using Leaping Magic to avoid the tree roots, landing in areas with sparse grass and immediately following up with a tiny version of “Mine Genesis”. The ground sank before her eyes, with precipitous amounts of dirt falling into the hole from the trees.

Holes and dirt showers. This was a trap that most likely intended to bury the unfortunate prey alive. Kanon smirked proudly before jumping over the hole.

Her right foot immediately sank into the soft mud upon landing.

“Oh, damn it!”

Kanon hurriedly tried to reactivate the recently terminated Leaping Magic a multitude of times. Her left leg kicked off in midair, allowing the right foot to spring free of the mud, but accompanied by a white rope around the ankle.

Kanon’s body had completely left the ground.

The white rope was pulled straight upwards while the other end seemed to be tied within the soft mud.

Kanon’s body was tied down by the rope and came to a stop in midair. Since the set parameters could not be met, the Jumping Magic fizzled, ultimately resulting in –

“Wah!”

--Kanon’s body tilting forward and landing back into the mud.

“Chiyoda-senpai!”

The team from First High caught up to Kanon because she fell into a trap. With Subaru in the lead, the sound that emanated from witnessing this disastrous scene was one of astonishment rather than fear.

Kanon rose from the mud. That being said, everything from the chest down was still buried in the mud.

She yanked both hands from the mud and placed her right hand on the left wrist.

The mud erupted.

A mud spring many times more furious than the falling splatter erupted with Kanon’s figure as the epicenter.

Detecting the signs of magic beforehand, Miyuki quickly erected a reverse kinetic magic barrier. Thanks to her timely crafted transparent barrier, eleven female students were spared being drenched in mud.

This explosion came from the personal Acceleration-Type Magic “Speed Ripper”. Needless to say, the caster was the one at the epicenter, Kanon.

Standing in the middle of the crucible shape in the ground (of what was a muddy pond) was a perfectly immaculate Kanon with her head bowed. Forget the mud, not even a speck of dust was visible. She had likely set her body and clothes as the launching point for “Speed Ripper” and sent all of the mud and dust flying. Even the rope tied around her ankle was nowhere to be seen.

The tiniest of mishaps while using this sort of magic like this would result in accidentally tearing all the hair off of one’s body and suffering unimaginable pain. Another possibility may be shredding every ounce of clothing, leaving an equally horrific outcome. However, Kanon seemed to have wielded this magic with an excellent grasp of skill.

Kanon used a freshly cleaned hand to push her protective goggles up and rubbed at her eyes. The goggles’ sealing properties were up to par, so mud should not have gotten into her eyes. Yet…… Any young lass would like want to bawl her eyes out after being dunked into a mud pit.

Before the eyes of her seniors and juniors, Kanon carefully replaced her goggles at a normal pace before raising her head in direction of the finish line.

Anyone watching her back could tell she took a deep breath.

And then –

“—Is this a freaking joke!? What kind of military training is this?!”

Kanon shrieked hysterically and rocketed out of the crucible-like hole.

“……Let’s be off.”

“……Yes.”

After Subaru finished speaking next to Miyuki, the two of them led their teammates racing down the course.




“This is impossible! Is that guy even human?”

The chief of development for the Parasite Dolls howled in anguish within the operational lab.

His proud creations were being retired one after another.

Two Parasite Dolls struck from the flanks at speeds that not even Magicians from the Ten Master Clans could react to by firing oscillation waves. These two dolls possessed the demonic power of “sound” and could use subtle oscillation waves at will to disturb an enemy’s sense of balance, or use violent oscillation waves to shatter their hearing. Correction, if wielded at full power without any thought given towards time requirements, being released at high efficiency would manifest Phonon Mazer even without a specified Magic Sequence. The demonic power at their disposal was just that powerful.

The attacks from his beloved dolls were taking effect. The dolls’ attacks penetrated the shock absorbent layers on the newest combat armor devised by the military and wounded the Magician’s innards. Just now, the lurch from the Magician was definitely not for show, but he was able to counterattack in the next second even after sustaining the attack.

The first strike was Ancient Magic, a sort of Non-Systematic Type Magic known as “Surge”. The chief of development had no idea why this was all that was necessary to deal damage to the Parasite Dolls, but for now he was able to hypothesize that this was some sort of attack. Nevertheless, the ensuing direct attack after drawing to close combat range –

“What the hell is this guy doing? What just happened?”

It was nothing more than a mere palm strike on the Parasite Doll’s chest. This mystified the chief of development as to why that was enough to send the Parasite Doll into stasis. The Parasite was not released, nor was the servitor’s body destroyed, but this was still sufficient to bring the machine to a halt.

If this technique was enough to send shivers down one’s spine, then yonder body of flesh and blood that was able to continue fighting after sustaining multiple injuries from demonic powers from the Parasite Dolls was even more horrifying.

“Could this guy truly be immortal…… An actual vampire?”

The conference room reserved for high-ranking officers within the general headquarters building was also suffused with the same befuddlement that ran rampant through the Operations Lab.

“This Magician…… What is his body made of? This is far beyond the level of being able to withstand blows.”

The observation cameras were currently showing a four-on-one battle. Through the network, the Mobile Armor had noticeable indentions in the limbs and back. One of the dolls operated a metal ball and sent it flying in for a direct hit on the Magician’s body while another doll sent mercury pellets shooting out from 18 different positions on the body that also penetrated the Mobile Armor.

Yet, in the next instant, this Magician struck back at the Parasite Dolls as if nothing had occurred.

“Mahesvara……”

One of the members present murmured.

“What?”

Colonel Sakai posed the question.

“Colonel, during last year’s disturbance at Yokohama and the defense of Okinawa four years ago, do you know of the combat Magician who was called ‘Mahesvara’ by the enemy?”

“……Now that you mention it, I have heard of this person. Annihilating mobile weaponry in one blow, able to recover from any enemy attack without any lasting effect…… Could it be him?”

“Based on the situation, ‘Mahesvara’ is a Magician who is connected with Major Kazama.”

“Major Harunobu Kazama from the 101st Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion……”

Equipped with the Mobile Armor developed by the 101st Battalion and a Magician whose durability was such that men considered him immortal. The details were aligned.

“Why has such a monster appeared at a high school tournament……?”

The Nine Schools Competition was a highly important event for Magicians, but this was nothing more than academic entertainment for the JSDF. Even if the experiment went awry, at most there would only be four or five injuries among the students. Colonel Sakai did not believe that Saeki or Kazama were really concerned about the loss of life.

Unable to divine General Saeki’s true purpose, Colonel Sakai felt a chill crawl up his spine in warning.




The engineering vehicle that Minami and Pixie were on was currently in a tight spot.

The private militia from the Kudou Family (not that Minami was aware of their identities) had been scattered by the security forces that had appeared from the base. However, this time it was the security forces from base clamoring to get inside.

From security’s perspective, this was a logical demand. This was because, given the events of the previous year, another unidentified organization had infiltrated the JSDF’s base and even opened fire. Though the group they wanted to arrest and detain were the ones who had opened fire, their reaction to question why the other group was fired upon was also logical progression.

Despite this, Minami could not comply with their demands. Actually, it was alright if she did comply, but allowing unrelated military forces to witness the interior of the vehicle would complicate things for everyone.

“I’ve already said, we are the victims here. I don’t see the reason that we must comply with your interrogation.”

“This is a military facility, we have the right to police the premises! If you are innocent, then immediately disable the protective barrier and open the door!”

This banter was going back and forth for a while (speaking of which, the voice that was projected through the camera had been altered). Even if the current situation persisted, the protective barrier could last another hour. Furthermore, Tatsuya had given her a CAD that was fully operable through thought, so even if they suffered sudden magical attack, she was still able to alter the barrier on the fly.

Nonetheless, Minami personally wished that the situation did not escalate any further.

(Tatsuya-sama, please return quickly……)

Minami never considered to inquire ideas from the currently embattled Tatsuya – which was nothing short of hampering Tatsuya’s battle, so she could only sit there and allow the situation to stagnate.




Fifteen minutes after the race began, each school was no longer congregating together to challenge the course and had split into three groups racing for the finish line.

The leaders from First High’s detachment were Kanon, Subaru, and Miyuki. Kanon had competed in Track and Field during 3000 meter hurdles, but as for her specialty in magic, she was someone who was more accustomed to the feeling of running while clearing obstacles. Subaru’s specialty lay in “leaping”. Miyuki deftly manipulated Flying-Type Magic close to the ground in order to avoid the obstacles.

The three of them were currently slightly more than two kilometers from the starting line and were about to progress into the second half of the course. Subaru, who had been lightly tapping off of the tree trunks while progressing forward, suddenly came to an abrupt halt and landed near a group of fruit trees.

“Subaru, what happened?”

Catching up to Subaru, Miyuki also stopped and began asking the other girl. Although this was a race, this was still a competition where the sort of hidden obstacles for this route remained unknown. Once they had discovered something, paying it no heed was foolish in the extreme. It was precisely for this reason that they had split into twos and threes instead of advancing alone.

“Take a look at this.”

Miyuki and Kanon looked towards where Subaru was pointing and both frowned. There, there lay what appeared to be a female body.

“—That’s a female combat servitor.”

Kanon said the object’s real identity out loud. She was not someone who carried the look of technical expertise, but given that she was from the Chiyoda Family, a lineage that specialized in combat within the Hundred Families, it was highly probable that she had seen something similar before.

“Looks to me it has stopped moving. What do you two think?”

Miyuki immediately grasped that this was a Parasite Doll that had been taken out by Tatsuya. However, she betrayed no hint of this to her cohorts and only described the scene that lay before her.

“Looks the same to me.”

“Perhaps it wasn’t recovered from an earlier training exercise?”

This sentiment came from Subaru. This speculation seemed to hold water despite being utterly impossible, but Kanon was none the wiser.

“……At any rate, there’s no need to worry since it isn’t moving. Maybe it’s just to put us on our guard and slow us down.”

This was Kanon’s assessment. Given that she had already reached this conclusion, there was no need for Miyuki to voice any dissent.

“So?”

“Let’s move on before we waste any more time.”

Kanon took off at a run after saying this, with Subaru and Miyuki quickly following.




(They’re more capable than I imagined…… This is taking much longer than expected. Given the distance until Miyuki reaches this location, there’s probably only 10 minutes of buffer time left.)

Surrounded by the Parasite Dolls, Tatsuya ruminated to himself.

Compared to where he ran across his first Parasite Doll, his current location was quite close to the finish line. He had already incapacitated every Parasite Doll between here and the starting line. So long as all 16 Parasite Dolls ceased to move, then this incident could be counted as finished “in his eyes”.

Amid the incoming superpower (the Kudou Family referred to this as “demonic powers”) attacks coming from all directions, Tatsuya charged forward while only protecting the vital areas of the head and heart and swiftly came into contact with the first Parasite Doll.

The high speed movement from the servitor sliced Tatsuya’s arm practically to the bone, but his other hand directly retaliated against the doll.

Instantly, the process that shut down the Parasite began to take effect.

Supported by the purely cognitive CAD, Tatsuya called forth the supporting Activation Sequence for Gram Dispersal from the Trident still sitting in its holster and dispelled the magic being directed towards his head. Next, he jumped over the fallen Parasite Doll before him and temporarily escaped the enclosure before using “Restoration” to recover his arm to its original state. His Restoration was a magic that caused the enemy to scream “cheater”, but this did not mean it was omnipotent or invincible.

Restoration was accompanied by pain.

This was an important element that could affect concentration and prevent magic invocation. He had already grown accustomed to pain, but even he was not able to avoid the temporary hesitation brought on by pain.

Utilizing a full backup of Restoration could block the pain, but under those circumstances, Restoration would temporarily monopolize the entire Magic Calculation Area, crucially delaying any counterattack.

It was precisely for this reason why Tatsuya shielded the vitals that impacted life and death. So long as his psions were not exhausted, he wouldn’t die even if suffered a fatal injury. However, if he did suffer a life threatening blow, then his survival instincts would automatically initiate a full backup and put every other magic ability on hold. If the opponent was a first rate Magician and Tatsuya had no support, the circumstances would only grow more and more dire. The combat prowess of the Parasite Dolls was in no way inferior to first class Magicians, and the activation speed of their superpowers was superior to modern magic as well.

Nevertheless – the fact that he was still able to spell out these depressing words while still conscious indicated that he still had strength to give.

Once Tatsuya grasped the method to incapacitate his enemies without releasing the Parasite within, the Parasite Dolls ceased to become a threat.

The reason why Parasites that had latched onto humans were so difficult to deal with was because the death of the host would immediately release the Parasite’s main body, and Tatsuya had no method of directly harming the main body.

That being said, if the Parasite’s host was a female combat servitor, then being damaged was a far cry from death. Furthermore, so long as there remained a minute amount of psions within the frame, the Parasite would enter hibernation as to avoid harming the main body.

Tatsuya was exposed before the crossfire of superpower attacks and suffered tremendously. Overcoming his own blood and pain, he forced the 12th Parasite Doll into hibernation.

(The last four…… Are over there!)



“Only four Parasite Dolls left!”

The horrified reports shouted by his subordinates caused the chief of development for the Parasite Doll experimental team to almost bite down on his lips hard enough to draw blood. He had no idea what Tatsuya – what “Mahesvara” was assessed as. Yet, what the chief of development did know was that if a single Magician was able to crush 16 Parasite Dolls, this would undeniably leave a mark of failure upon the Parasite Doll development project.

“However, the four remaining ones…… The initial four will not be such easy prey……!”

The chief of development muttered to himself as he gazed at the images being broadcasted to him by the Parasite Dolls.

These words sounded both hollow and unwilling to back down, causing his subordinates seated to his sides to watch with deep unease.



The instant after Tatsuya detected the four Parasite Dolls, a cannonball the size of a man’s fist shot towards him before he could use magic. Through his Eidos senses, Tatsuya “beheld” the cannonball that flew at a speed almost beyond the human eye to follow. Diameter at 12 centimeters, weight, five kilograms, speed clocked at 400 kilometers per hour. Although its speed was much lower than that of a bullet, the energy contained within was highly unusual.

Tatsuya reached out with his right hand to catch the cannonball. Crafted from dirt, the ball shattered the moment it came into contact with his hand. This was not simply crumbling, but exploding outwards in the form of tiny pebbles. This was done by deconstructing the dirt that made up the cannonball down to the level of pebbles, using the scattering motion to release the kinetic energy within.

Tatsuya used his specialty to deflect the enemy’s opening attack, but there was no time to catch his breath. His opponents created a field as thin as silk and sought to shoot it towards him. Directly in front of him and to the flanks were two repulsion fields, an attack that shared a similar theoretical background with Weight-Type Magic “Pressure Slash”. That these fields were precise enough to rend and tear without a blade or steel wire to serve as a base must be thanks to the precision of their mechanical frames.

Once more, Tatsuya was forced to pre-emptively go on the defense. Gram Dispersal nullified the Parasite Dolls’ Pressure Slash. At the same time, he entered close quarters combat range with another one of them.

His opponent held a large blade that measured 30 centimeters in each hand. The weapon itself posed no threat to Tatsuya, but the problem lay in the speed of the slashes.

(Swift–)

Purely in terms of speed, this easily rivaled Erika’s personal acceleration magic.

(Nonetheless–)

She had “skill”. While her movements were precise and without extraneous movement, that was all it was, and the exactitude of the movements could be easily predicted. Tatsuya avoided the left and right combo and activated Gram Dispersal. The acceleration magic empowering the machine immediately lost its effect, lowering the doll’s movements to the level of “ordinary humans”.

That’s one down. Tatsuya thought as he was about to strike out with his right hand, but –

“What!?”

A repulsion barrier manifested in front of the blade-wielding Parasite Doll. This did not come from the frames that had cast Pressure Slash, as it was the fourth Parasite Doll who had cast the barrier.

Tatsuya was rocked backwards while the blade-wielding Parasite Doll retreated as well. Gathered together, the four Parasite Dolls formed a diamond formation. The foremost was built for high-speed close quarters combat, the right utilized compressed dirt as cannonballs, the one on the left hand side wielded Pressure Slash, with the fourth one bringing up the rear with repulsion barriers.

A cannonball sped towards where Tatsuya had recovered himself. Tatsuya used Flying-Type Magic to bolster his jump to one side to avoid the attack, but a razor sharp flying blade was sent his way. After Tatsuya deconstructed the magic blade and charged forward, he was met by two gigantic blades supported by a transparent barrier as a shield.

(These ones have a high degree of cooperation.)

This was practically as if all four of them were of one mind as their teamwork was markedly different than the 12 that had already been retired, leaving no opening for Tatsuya to attack.



“Excellent, Prime Four, that’s the way!”

Within the Kudou operation lab, the chief of the Parasite Doll development project was highly energized by this outcome.

“Just like that! Cut him!”

Filled with trepidation, his subordinates prodded the animated chief with a question.

“Um…… Chief, weren’t we ordered not to kill him?”

“Ah? Are you all blind? That Magician possesses powerful regeneration, cutting off a limb or two won’t kill him.”

The chief kept his eyes glued to the screen and responded in a tone that brooked no argument. The pupils fixated on the screen danced with madness.



[Master, to your right!]

A telepathic voice rang out in his brain. Acceding to those instructions, Tatsuya swiftly tilted his body to the left, allowing the dirt cannonball to slip by his right shoulder and hurtle into the rear.

[Reloading will take 50 seconds. A flying blade is on approach from the left, please avoid by stepping one meter to the right.]

Tatsuya followed these avoidance instructions and the flying blade formed by Pressure Slash indeed passed 30 centimeters to Tatsuya’s left.

“Pixie, can you tell how the enemy will attack?”

Tatsuya used the armor concealed within his glove to deflect the mobile Parasite Doll’s blade and asked Pixie over the transmitter.

[Incoming cannonball aimed for the head…… Correct, Master, I can hear them speaking to one another.]

“Speaking? Are you telling me that they are not acting on their personal judgment?”

Using concepts from fisticuffs, Tatsuya lowered his head to avoid the cannonball while defusing the enemy’s personal acceleration spell at the same time. The right hand holding the spell that disabled the enemy servitors was a hair away from making contact, but was blocked by the enemy barrier at the last second.

[Those four are constantly exchanging thoughts while acting.]

As Tatsuya was being blown back by the repulsion barrier, Pixie’s answer to his earlier question was passed to his ears. This answer gave him a deeper insight into the situation. This was not one brain controlling all four limbs, but more like one mind was controlling “the four of them” by splitting into four partitions.

Additionally, Pixie was able to intercept the Parasite Dolls’ “conversation”. In that case, they were much easier to deal with.

“Pixie, transmit enemy chatter.”

[Acknowledge.]



“How did it suddenly turn out like this?!”

The chief shouted in confusion, though this time his subordinates shared his sentiment.

The attacks coming from the first four Parasite Dolls crafted by the former 9th Research Lab – the Prime Four, were no longer leaving their mark.

The dirt cannonball was being blocked by the enemy’s hand just as he was avoiding the attacks from the Gravity Dagger (they also referred to the Pressure Blade’s flying edge as the G-Dagger). The highly mobile Parasite Doll’s attacks were being dodged as if her blows had been telegraphed to the enemy, who also voluntarily retreated just as the repulsion barrier began to manifest. While their side had not reported any major damage, it was plain that their enemy was now clued in to the movements of the Prime Four.

For the first time, the Magician wearing the Mobile Armor seized the initiative on offense. The dolls altered their combat pattern by leading with two shots from the G-Dagger towards the legs, but they were immediately dispersed shortly after being fired.

The chief and his minions were wholly unaware of what happened, but even if they stopped to think, the Parasite Dolls would not cease their activities. Once an autonomous weapon received its orders, they would continue their mission until receiving fresh commands or ordered to desist.

On the screen, the agile model was assaulting the enemy and the artillery model cupped its hands in preparation. The blade was a feint as the real blow would come from the shot. Yet, the Magician in the Mobile Armor seemed to know this from the very get go and passed to the side of the blade-wielding servitor.

The Eidos of the repulsion barrier began to form – and abruptly vanished with the information seas.

The Magician in the Mobile Armor appeared before the artillery model and laid his right hand on the cannonball. The cannonball turned into dust and slipped through the Parasite Doll’s fingers.

Like a human being, the artillery model stood stock still in amazement.

The left hand of the Magician in the Mobile Armor had already landed on her chest.

“How can this be possible……?”

The researchers screamed in disbelief – or were perhaps unwilling to believe, as the devices monitoring the artillery model within the Prime Four indicated that the servitor had shut down.

The four Parasite Dolls possessed flawless coordination on the attack. This was precisely thanks to their superb compatibility, made all the weaker when one of them was removed from the equation.



[Slashing, right hand, right leg, left leg.]

Even without Pixie’s guidance, Tatsuya had already recognized this attack pattern. The artillery model’s responsibility was to restrain the enemy with long range attacks, so now Tatsuya could concentrate on dealing with the enemies’ magic once that restraint was no longer in place.

After Tatsuya used Gram Dispersal to deconstruct Pressure Slash, he rushed the sword-wielding Parasite Doll. He abolished the protective barrier in front of him and stretched his hand towards the blade. For the Parasite Doll, this should be beyond their anticipation – this must not have been programmed into their electronic brains. There was no way of telling whether the delay arose from the machine or the demon within.

Tatsuya seized hold on the blade.

New Damascus alloy – a compound created from nanometer-long silicon tubes – abruptly crumbled into sand. Not only did this apply to the blade he caught hold of, but the other blade he had not touched also suffered the same fate.

Since magic was used to disintegrate the weapon, there was no need to lay hands on the weapon in the first place, but this did serve to be a more shocking scene to bear witness to.

As he was the instigator, Tatsuya naturally felt no astonishment at this turnout. Rather than approaching the disarmed servitor, he instead stepped towards the Parasite Doll in charge of the defenses stationed to the rear. Without taking advantage of the Mobile Armor’s abilities, Tatsuya needed only one step to close the five yard gap between them.

The repulsion field that served as the protective barrier spread out again. Without paying any heed to variety, the speed at which this superpower could deploy the protective barrier was much swifter than Tatsuya.

Yet, the magic at Tatsuya’s fingertips was not restricted to only disrupting magic being invoked, but also abolishing magic that had already been completed, so an ability that could merely erect a barrier held little meaning against him. Without any accompaniment on offense, just this alone was not going to constitute a threat against Tatsuya.

The defensive servitor fell into hibernation.

The remaining servitors were the agile model used for close quarters combat and the frame built for close range fire support. Right now, they were nothing more than prey dancing in Tatsuya’s palm.




[Master, congratulations!]

Pixie suddenly released a loud cry over their telepathic connection, almost causing Minami to accidentally disable her magic barrier.

“Here too……”

This passionate outburst seemed wholly incompatible with an alien creature, and thus Minami only mumbled to herself. Not that she was aware of this, of course.

“Pixie, has Tatsuya-sama defeated all the Parasite Dolls?”

Rather than being concerned for Tatsuya’s wellbeing, her followup question seemed to be a verification that contained no hint of worry.

[Correct. Master has caused my kin to all enter hibernation.]

It was only now that Pixie returned to vocal communication, but Minami paid that detail no heed.

“While I really wish he could come back quickly, but……”

At this point, Minami realized that even if Tatsuya suddenly returned now, that may only serve to pour oil on the fire.

The security troops were still deployed outside around their car.

Under these circumstances, if a masked soldier in full combat regalia with an unknown affiliation appeared, this may result in a fiery outcome –

Just then, Minami’s portable terminal emitted a ping to alert her about an incoming call.

Who could this be? Minami thought as she glanced at the sender. Originally, she held low expectations as she surmised this must be an anonymous call, but the screen betrayed her expectations as the name “Kuroba Fumiya” appeared on the screen.

“Hello?”

How does he know my phone number? Minami thought in bemusement as she answered the phone.

The barrier continued to persist.

“This is Kuroba Fumiya. Are you Sakurai Minami-san?”

“I am.”

“Thank goodness I got through to you. I sincerely apologize for looking up your phone number without your permission. Setting that aside, I would like to double check something.”

“No, I don’t mind at all if Kuroba-sama knows my phone number – what did you need to check?”

“Currently, is the car covered by the protective barrier and surrounded by security yours, Sakurai-san?”

“Please call me Minami…… Your assessment is correct.”

A somewhat confusing air came across from the other side of the terminal, but the conversation continued unabated.

“……Minami-san, you’re not acting as a decoy, are you? In short, is there a need to keep security here?”

“Not only do I not want them here, they were causing me tremendous hassle…… Furthermore, Fumiya-sama, please do not call me ‘Minami-san’, a simple Minami will suffice.”

“……We can discuss that part another day. Setting that aside, I will knock out all the security forces over there. Please sustain the protective barrier until then.”

“Understood, we’re counting on you…… Also, please call me Minami. After all, I’m only a maid and Fumiya-sama is one of the candidates to be the next head of house.”

“……Then I shall begin. This should take less than 5 minutes.”

The tone of Fumiya’s parting words was rather kind.

[We won……!] Once Minami heard these words, it was hard to tell whether those words reverberated through her.



As he looked towards the familiar psion waves, he could see a particularly sturdy magic barrier. After noting the possibility and verifying, he discovered that it was indeed one of the “Sakura series” affiliated with the Yotsuba named Minami, who was currently staying with Tatsuya.

Fumiya could roughly estimate what had occurred. That vehicle likely belonged to his esteemed “Tatsuya onii-san” and served a purpose in the experiment to destroy the Parasite Dolls. In that case, the security forces must be barred from access and they could not add on to Tatsuya’s burden.

(All of you certainly are terribly unlucky.)

Fumiya pulled out a glove-shaped CAD. Currently, he had the appearance of a typical male student in high school, but chose not to appear before others. He persuaded himself that any “disguise” would be unnecessary.

Fumiya was currently 20 meters from the vehicle. In truth, “Direct Pain” could easily hit the targets at this range, but he had crawled to extreme close range to prevent overdoing his attack.

All of you are seriously unlucky – Fumiya internally said to the security guards before mercilessly applying “Direct Pain” to the security guards crowded around the vehicle.



By the time Tatsuya returned to the engineering vehicle, he was struck speechless by the security guards lying haphazardly around the car. Fumiya had alerted his subordinates from the Kuroda Family to clean up the mess, but the men in black were only just arriving.

Making sure that there was no one else present, Tatsuya climbed on board and stowed the Mobile Armor within the “coffin” as he was instructed before pressing the self-destruct button. He then departed the scene with Minami and Pixie in tow.

Just as Fujibayashi said, not one of the security guards laying around the car were injured.

Not that Tatsuya was there to witness that.




The fundamental difference between Steeple Chase and any normal Track and Field exercise was that there was no way to tell what happened to the other contestants. A normal cross country race would also have limited mobility, but at least the route was clearly defined and a person’s position could be determined by who was ahead or behind. However, there was no clear path in the Steeple Chase, vision remained obstructed by the foliage, and, aside from the few teammates that were close by, there was practically no way of ascertaining the status of other players.

In spite of this, the transparent protection visor could be relied on to report how many people had arrived at the finish line. At the corner of the map display, the number of people who had already arrived remained at zero.

There was only 200 meters until the finish line.

Miyuki was certain she was in the lead.

Running by the side, Kanon was of the same mind.

Kanon suddenly picked up speed and Subaru also began the final sprint so as to not fall behind.

Miyuki hesitated for a moment. Her current speed was not intentionally dialed down; this was simply the maximum speed if one was going to remain on guard for traps. Moving any faster raised the possibility of running afoul of one of the traps. Should she emphasize safety, or risk it all and strive for first place –

“Ah!”

“Wah~!”

Just as Miyuki was debating this, a series of shrieks came from ahead of her.

Multiple automatic turrets spat out a continuous stream of paint pellets, causing Kanon to crash to the earth after taking multiple hits. The paint pellets possessed no penetrating power, but on the other hand, the kinetic force of the pellets were transferred entirely into the impact. There was simply no way to remain upright while absorbing these shots from below the waist to the flank, so the only thing Kanon could do was go to ground in a defensive stance to avoid injury.

Meanwhile, Subaru was hit in midair by a web canister and was brought down ensnared within the net. As the magic Subaru used was not “Flying-Type” but “Leaping”, part of the descending force was mitigated by magic, hereby allowing her to take less of a blow than Kanon. Nonetheless, the sight of her flailing about in the net was probably much more shameful for the young girl than what Kanon was going through.

“I…… I don’t think they need to deploy military training at a place like this……”

Kanon groaned in pain, but it was hard to say if her words were meant as a complaint or just grousing since her tone signified that she was more than up to the challenge. Miyuki judged that this should not constitute a problem for either of them and alerted the two of them to her decision.

“Excuse me, I’m going on ahead.”

Neither of the two replied, though there was blatantly an aura of “you heartless person~!” emanating around them.

That being said, Steeple Chase was an individual competition. Even if they were schoolmates, they remained competitors during the race given that they only teamed up out of mutual benefit. Miyuki fully adopted her merciless stance (not really) and once more started running for the finish line.

Out of the corner of her eye, she carefully monitored the map.

The number of people who reached the finish line remained at zero.

And so, Miyuki became the first one to cross the finish line. Relying on sheer determination, Kanon managed to get back in the race and cleanly finished as second. Having spent much more effort getting free of the net, Subaru had to settle for eighth. As for the other notable members from First High, Honoka and Shizuku combined to capture fifth and sixth.





Chapter 8




Colonel Sakai’s group very hurriedly left behind the command tower. They reasoned that the possibility of them becoming targets of that flying magician “Makeishura[12]” was nil. But they were very aware that they were in a position to support the Parasite Doll experiments. Reason enough that some major horror was heading for them.

As they left the building and managed to reach the parking lot, for some reason the sky turned dark.

On seeing the sky, Sakai realized that something was amiss.

The sky didn’t turn cloudy.

They were smothered with a thick fog.

“Just what is this……?”

“Is it gas?”

“No, it’s magic!”

The magician accompanying Colonel Sakai managed to get right what was behind the thick fog.

However, they only knew that it was magic. Without knowing its effects, they could not make it disappear.

“You have been invited, Colonel Sakai and staff.”

As they shifted their focus onto the playful voice, they saw a man in his prime dressed in a suit in spite of mid-summer and wearing diagonally a soft hat bowing smartly before them.

“I invite you to the world of dreams.”

After that, Sakai’s consciousness slipped into the darkness.




The Steeplechase Cross-Country concluded with Miyuki taking the girl’s crown and Masaki taking the boy’s crown.

And this year’s overall went to First High. Though it was a tough fight all the way, the morale of Team First High was even higher than last year.

Although at the very end Masaki didn’t manage to grab the overall title, Third High somehow showed up at the night after-party with satisfied expressions. It’s possible that they may have felt Masaki’s “next time for sure” reaction in his efforts.

For other schools it was Fourth High that stood out for winning the championship in Rookies’ Monolith Code and Mirage Bat. The lovely twins responsible for them, their dignified manners so out-of-place for their appearances, gave credence to the rumors from before.

And it was not only the players. Even the adults were raising their celebratory cups all together…




With a smile, Kudou Retsu gave a toast to the former heads of house Kuki and Kuzumi, and all the families from the “Ninth” still following them up to now.

No way it was a radiant smile. It was a smile with regrets floating about somewhere. Even the former heads of house Kuki and Kuzumi knew what regrets were brewing deep inside Kudou Retsu’s heart. That was why they didn’t raise it to Retsu; they often alternated toasting each other as if telling him to do the toasting instead.

“Everyone, I thank you for your efforts.”

Finally, Retsu started to spin out his words of gratitude spontaneously.

“The parasite doll experiments may have ended with disappointing results on the surface, but they gave a hard fight against the ‘Makeishura’. This would leave a strong impression to the people planning to use magic in the military.”

Approving applause came from the party.

“Those who plan to draft young magicians will have been overthrown by tomorrow, along with the traditionalists. That too is a considerable result, I might say.”

“Not tomorrow.”

However, the voice suddenly interrupting them was heard from the other side of the door.

“Who’s there!”

The lower-ranked stood up and faced the door.

Retsu knew who the voice that said those words belonged to before he could ascertain the appearance.

“Kazama-kun…and Elder Saeki.”

However, it was not only Kazama who had rudely disrupted the proceedings.

“It’s been a while, Elder Kudou.”

Everyone present at the party were lost for words at the unexpected incident.

None of them even offered Saeki a seat ---- and to which she paid no heed.

“What brings you here, to be so sudden. This is a private gathering. A shame, but we cannot offer you the hospitality you deserve.”

“I’m very much aware that this is an unexpected visit. If you accept our present then we will take our leave.”

“A present?”

Saeki’s way of speaking was clearly undiplomatic. But even if that was not the case, the factions of “Nine” had bad impressions of her as a sly female fox who went against Retsu.

Amidst the silently rising animosity, Saeki signaled to Kazama.

[I am Colonel Sakai of JSDF GHQ. I am the one who conspired with the head of house Kudou, Kudou Makoto, and promoted that the experiments on autonomous magic weaponry be held at the Nine Schools Competitions…]

Everyone present, apart from Retsu, all stood up and howled.

The voice being played back from the recorder in Kazama’s hand was an acknowledgement and a confession that they conspired with house Kudou to force through a weapons test with high school students as guinea pigs.

“…So Colonel Sakai fell into your hands?”

“We are not the ones who captured Colonel Sakai.”

“…Would you mind telling me who did it?”

“I received this voice recording from house Yotsuba.”

All those who stood up and were gathering about had gasped.

“Maya… As I thought, the Yotsuba would never let away those who made a move on their kin.”

Retsu nodded, his way of speaking strangely consenting.

“That would not be the case.”

However, Saeki repudiated those words.

“And what do you mean by that?”

“When I received the voice recording, Yotsuba-dono added a condition that this recording should not be announced publicly.”

Retsu inquisitively raised his own eyebrows, unable to comprehend Maya’s true intentions.

“Yotsuba-dono’s objectives were to purge Sakai’s group, known as the anti-Great Asian Alliance hardliners. I received this voice recording from Yotsuba-dono on the conditions that I do the clean up after the purge and not to open its contents to the public.”

“I see… Sakai-kun has earned the wrath of ‘that person’.”

Retsu muttered in agreement. However he was still unable to understand all of it.

“Well then, what will you do with the data you have?”

“Elder Kudou, the JSDF will no longer treat magicians as weapons.”

“………”

“If you so wish I will even stake my own head for this. Magicians will no longer be compelled to stand in battle against their wishes. That goes for your grandson, and for ‘him’, too.”

“You… Want to tell me that I retire?”

“It’s true that the parasite dolls make for a beneficial weapon --- as long as there are no mistakes on how it was used. Had you done it ten years earlier, misguided uses like this time wouldn’t be done.”

“You’re speaking out of turn, Major General!”

“Enough.”

Retsu followed it with a gesture to calm down Kuki Mamoru, who had snapped out of his astonishment and was getting enraged.

“You performed magic weapon experiments on immature magicians. No matter how you gloss it over, I cannot say this was the right way to do it.”

Kazama, from Saeki’s side, butted in. His voice was filled with magma-like anger.

“Restrain yourself, Major Kazama.”

“Sir, I apologize for my impudence!”

This time it was Saeki who rebuked Kazama.

She looked at Retsu squarely in the eye.

“Please leave the magicians’ rights to us currently in active duty. We will not stand for any action that will put you, Elder Kudou, in fear.”

Towards Saeki who had made that simple declaration,

“Very well.”

As his shoulders dropped, Retsu answered back, somehow seemingly happy.




August 16, 2096. Night.

Yokohama Chinatown was wrapped up in a silent tumult.

“Target is heading for the west gate.”

“We have an advantage in location on the other side. Make sure you corner him with no less than three people.”

The group rushing about in the dark and exchanging only faint whispers at each other was a hit squad spearheaded by Kuroba Mitsugu.

“Target spotted… Guaaah!”

“What’s wrong!?”

“Some kind of a hound-like being has……!”

“Everyone watch out! Zhou Gongjin uses magic different from even what the Dahan and Great Asian Alliance use.”

The confidant standing beside Mitsugu raised an inquiry as if muttering.

“He’s tougher than expected, Boss.”

“He’s a big game who had thoroughly messed up with domestic affairs. It’s very unlikely that he’s weak in personal capabilities.”

Mitsugu answered in a composed voice. With even no hints of trembling.

The confidant continued on with a relieved tone.

“But the mistress obliged to deploy Shiba Tatsuya-dono…?”

“We will secure Zhou Gongjin before he arrives.”

However, on hearing his confidant’s words, Mitsugu abruptly laid bare his irritation, as if to make his composure unbelievable.

“Will it be okay not to wait for the arrival of Fumiya-sama and Shiba Tatsuya-dono?”

“What the hell is Maya-san thinking?”

Having totally lost his self-control, Mitsugu ended up calling Maya as “Maya-san” in spite of his confidant standing in front of him.

“That person shouldn’t be used in this situation. That person shouldn’t be even let outside in the first place. That person is the manifestation of the Yotsuba’s sins. Just locking him up within the Yotsuba is enough for our atonement.”

Mitsugu, after noticing his confidant’s dumbfounded look, coughed loudly.

“I’m going in. You take charge.”

“Yes, Boss.”

Mitsugu’s figure dissolved into the darkness.

This will be brought to an end without even waiting for Tatsuya, the confidant thought.



“End of the line, Zhou Gongjin.”

A few minutes later, Mitsugu was standing in front of Zhou.

“My goodness…… It’s Yotsuba’s darker side, the head of house Kuroba, showing himself for a lowly servant like me. Looks like you have overestimated me.”

“Don’t think we underestimated you. Blanche’s uprisings, No Head Dragon’s secret maneuvers, guiding the Great Asian Alliance special forces, arranging to smuggle in Parasites…… You sure have the nerve to do them by yourself.”

“I assure you, I only gave a helping hand. They would have happened sooner or later without my assistance.”

“You’re a bother for sure. For making later into now.”

“Can’t you see that postponing wouldn’t solve anything?”

“I can’t see the reason why postponing is a bad thing.”





Mitsugu slowly closed the distance.

“At this distance you can’t get away with your specialty Ghost Walker[13]. Give it up, Zhou.”

“Indeed. To get up close and personal means my divination is useless.”

Zhou didn’t lose his composure as he judged that his special spells were sealed up.

“Therefore, this will hurt a little bit. --- 疾, ‘哮天犬[14]’!”

Mitsugu didn’t have the time to say “What the ---?”

For a four legged shadow descended from the night sky.

A silhouette of a giant hound rushed on Mitsugu and bit off one of his arms.

“Guh…”

Struck silent, Mitsugu crumpled down.

The black hound had already disappeared without a trace.

“Good grief…… That took me ten years to prepare it. Oh well, it would do in exchange for Kuroba Mitsugu’s arm.”

Muttering those words, Zhou Gongjin’s figure slipped into the shadows.



“Father!”

After having gone to fetch Tatsuya, Fumiya, as soon as he saw Mitsugu’s figure, pushed his way through the wall of men in black suits and ran up to him, his expression visibly changing.

“Just who did this…… Oh yeah! Tatsuya-niisan!”

Fumiya had remembered the unusual power of his esteemed second cousin he took along, and gave out a longing look. In response, Tatsuya used his left hand to draw out a pistol-shaped CAD.

“No… I don’t need your help.”

“Father, what are you saying!?”

“Fumiya.”

Tatsuya told Fumiya, about to resort to violence by shaking hard at a heavily injured person, to control himself. Then he aimed his left hand towards Mitsugu.

“This may not please you, but leaving you as you are would only make Fumiya and Ayako unhappy.”

He then activated Restoration. “Mitsugu’s right arm”, bitten off and location unknown, had popped up from somewhere, joined with the injury and was connected.

As he unconsciously applied pressure onto “his own right arm”, Tatsuya muttered as if speaking to himself.

“Leaving behind Miyuki and Ayako and coming here was the right course of action. Be that as it may, Kuroba-san, for you to be that seriously injured… Just what kind of magic did Zhou Gongjin use?”

Mitsugu, looking annoyed at his own right arm, shook his head as he avoided looking Tatsuya in the eye.

“I don’t know. Zhou Gongjin said something like ‘Howling Celestial Hound’, but it’s impossible that there’s a spell with that name.”

“That’s fictitious then…… It must be a class of transforming bodies magic. He’s a worrying opponent…”

Tatsuya didn’t ask where Zhou ran off to.

All he knew was that from here on, they would have to locate this person at all costs.



(…to be continued in next volume)





Afterword




It’s already the 13th volume of “The Irregular at Magic High School”. Did you have fun reading this “Steeplechase Chapter”?

Though it was already indirectly touched on in the story, “Steeplechase” in English refers to an obstacle course race. The initial concept was not to use this as a reference to the competition on the final day of the Nine Schools Competition, but as a reference to the obstacle course race in which the protagonist has to seek out the true nature of the conspiracies thrown at him while overcoming various obstacles. However, looking at the results, rather than an obstacle course, it feels more like a maze with many blind alleys. Perhaps, it might be more apt to name this chapter as “Meandering Chapter”. But then, if the title were “Meandering Chapter”, it would give the impression that even the participants of Steeplechase Cross-Country would be meandering about the course.

The story this time is not about the Nine Schools Competition, but surrounds the Parasi-Doll conspiracy, and since the focal point is the Steeplechase Cross-Country as the stage, most of the activity of the participants in the other competitions have been left out. While you can catch a glimpse of the various episodes unfolding not just during the matches but also in-between the matches, it was impossible to incorporate their sub-episodes.

And thus, I will be writing the sub-episodes occurring concurrently along with this “Steeplechase chapter” in the form of short stories. While it’s not yet confirmed how many sub-episodes there will be and what form they will take, you should be able to find out more through the official twitter in the near future.

Speaking of near future, by the time this book has reached your hands, the anime should have started airing. Please enjoy that as well. As the blu-ray will be accompanied by anecdotes of the Magic High School characters that have never been presented before, please look forward to it.

With that, hope we’ll meet again in the next volume, “Ancient City Insurrection Chapter”. Hope you can also patronize both the comics and anime.

Please continue to support “The Irregular at Magic High School”.

Notes




Ojii-sama: Japanese for Grandfather. “Sama” is a more respectful version of san for people of a higher rank than oneself, toward one’s guests or customers (such as a sports venue announcer addressing members of the audience), and sometimes toward people one greatly admires. Deities such as the native Shinto kami and the Christian God, are referred to as kami-sama, meaning “God-sama”. When used to refer to oneself, sama expresses extreme arrogance (or self-effacing irony), as in praising one’s self to be of a higher rank, as with ore-sama (“my esteemed self”).

Armagnac: Is a distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France. It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of Cognac. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l’origine et de la qualité (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l’Armagnac (BNIA).

Armagnac was one of the first areas in France to begin distilling spirits, but the overall volume of production is far smaller than Cognac production and therefore is less known outside Europe. In addition, they are for the most part made and sold by small producers, whereas Cognac production is dominated by big-name brands.

Yellow Turban: This refers to the Yellow Turban Rebellion that was related to Taoist sects. Although I don’t know of any golem warrior legends relating to it.

Mountain Sages: In Japanese myths, holy hermits study in mountains.

Norman: He’s referring to witchcraft from Normandy which is currently part of France.

Kekkai: An isolation field type of spell.

Hetu and Prataya: Buddhist terms referring to things that cause indirect and direct effects.

Ghost Member: A club member listed on the roster who takes part in few or none of the club activities.

Nino Magatama: A magatama is a comma shaped bead. The Nino indicates it is jeweled and is probably a reference to the Yasakani no Magatama, a piece of the Japanese Regalia.

Madatama are curved, comma-shaped beads that appeared in prehistoric Japan from the Final Jōmon period through the Kofun period, approximately ca. 1,000 BC to the 6th century AD. The beads, also described as jewels, were made of primitive stone and earthen materials in the early period, but by the end of the Kofun period were made almost exclusively of jade. Magatama originally served as decorative jewelry, but by the end of the Kofun period functioned as ceremonial and religious objects. Archaeological evidence suggests that magatama were produced in specific areas of Japan and were widely dispersed through the entirety of the Japanese archipelago by trade routes.

Boke and Tsukkomi: Are loosely equivalent to the roles of “funny man” or “comic” (boke) and “straight man” (tsukkomi) in the comedy duos of western culture. Outside of owarai, boke is sometimes used in common speech as an insult, similar to “idiot” in English, or baka in Japanese.

Minamoto no Yoshitsune (源 義経, 1159 – June 15, 1189): Was a general of the Minamoto clan of Japan in the late Heian and early Kamakura period. “It is evident that Yoshitsune had a genius for offensive warfare…and although Yoshitsune had no knowledge of naval warfare he had the advantage of an acute strategic insight and a quick eye for tactical chances.”

Yoshitsune was the ninth son of Minamoto no Yoshitomo, and the third and final son and child that Yoshitomo would father with Tokiwa Gozen. Yoshitsune’s older brother Minamoto no Yoritomo (the third son of Yoshitomo) founded the Kamakura shogunate. Yoshitsune’s name in childhood was Ushiwakamaru (牛若丸). Yoshitsune Minamoto (源 義経) is a general of Japan’s Heian period who is famously known to have led the expedition which toppled the Ise-Heishi. Despite performing his tasks admirably for his clan, his return home was not welcomed and Yoshitsune perished at the hands of his trusted allies.



However, according to some unsubstantiated myths and legends, Yoshitsune faked his death and ran away to another part of Japan to be safe with the woman he loved. Not much is known about the girl he was in love with, except that she was not a Japanese woman; she is a mystery woman who tended to Yoshitsune wounds after a battle. She was of a noble family that was killed by the Heishi Clan. Because of this, she stayed at the estate where Yoshitsune and his men were, and helped out the court ladies with their daily duties. According to other legends, he fled to Hokkaido, and one (discredited) rumor stated that he even became Ghengis Khan. Yoshitsune Minamoto fought many wars against different clans in order to maintain peace among the nations. He is considered one of the greatest and the most popular warriors of his era, and one of the most famous samurai fighters in the history of Japan.

Mandarin: Zhou deliberately spoke in Mandarin for the last part. A literal translation would be “Execute, ‘Heavenly Hound’ ”. Closest reference for the hound is Erlang Shen.



Erlang Shen (二郎神), or Erlang is a Chinese God with a third truth-seeing eye in the middle of his forehead.



Er-lang Shen may be a deified version of several semi-mythical folk heroes who help regulate China’s torrential floods, dating variously from the Qin, Sui and Jin dynasties. A later Buddhist source identify him as the second son of the Northern Heavenly King Vaishravana.



In the Ming semi-mythical novels Creation of the Gods and Journey to the West Erlang Shen is the nephew of the Jade Emperor. In the former he assisted the Zhou army in defeating the Shang. In the latter, he is the second son of a mortal and Jade emperor’s brother. In the legend, he is known as the greatest warrior god of heaven.
