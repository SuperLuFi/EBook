Chapter 0




The National Particle Accelerator Lab was located in Dallas, Texas in the USNA (not the northern part of the United States, but the United States that encompassed all of Northern America). At a full length of 30 km, the linear particle accelerator was preparing to experiment with micro black hole creation and evaporation based on the Hawking radiation theory.

In reality, preparations had already been completed two years ago, but the reason why this project was restarted despite its failure to receive approval due to its comparatively large unknown risks was because of what happened in the Far East sector near end of last month.

A titanic explosion eradicated the military harbor located on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula and the fleet stationed there within an instant. This was not just a simple event, but worthy of rating a major crisis.

This was not because of the scale of destruction, but because of the estimated instrument of this carnage.

After fierce debate among the scientists from the Department of National Defense, the cause of the detonation was determined to be matter conversion. Three years ago, only a small portion of the scholars stood by this, but this time there was consensus among the researchers.

By tracing back the estimated scale of the explosion, the amount of matter transmuted into energy was roughly 1 kg. —Although matter conversion on such a large scale had never been detected before, but since they already used an experimental device to record the annihilation reaction, they were able to use that to deduce what had occurred.

What required an explanation was that, based on the data of the “titanic explosion” recorded by the satellites, the distinctive properties of the annihilation reaction did not match those created under experimental conditions. Nor did they detect any debris left behind by nuclear fission or fusion. In other words, regardless of whether through the advent of some technology or magical power, someone utilized a previously unknown method to create a practical application for high energy explosions.

This result gave the upper echelons of the USNA fits.

If this was caused by magic, then they could hardly bemoan the fact that no one could replicate this achievement. While the magic system itself was systematic, ultimately human genes were the dominant property.

However, there was simply no way to craft any countermeasures if they had no idea how this phenomenon was achieved in the first place.

Once an enemy turned this upon them, the only path remaining to them was complete destruction.

This was a nightmare come to life.

How was the explosion brought about, the keys to the matter and energy conversion system, were these beyond their grasp…… Yet, this was precisely the impetus that revitalized the micro black hole creation and evaporation experiment.

In regards to the observable effect from matter to energy conversion from black hole evaporation, the theoretical proof was sound. The micro black hole experiment itself was designed to bring these theories to fruition. And then there was the matter of how the data from the “titanic explosion” differed from experimental estimates.

Still, according to the predictions from USNA scientists, although the annihilation effect did not match up perfectly with the experimental observation of Hawking radiation, there was still the possibility of obtaining a result that was completely different from theoretical estimates.

In summation, there was a chance that they could observe the same distinctive properties observed during the “titanic explosion”. The probability of this was not zero.

The fact that this flimsy possibility was enough to reopen such a dangerous and risky experiment was a clear testament to how desperate the upper echelons of the USNA had become.

To the point that they could ignore the dangers of the unknown.

The result of such a decision was encroaching towards them, nay, the entire world.

This hitherto undetected disaster was creeping closer.





Chapter 1




There was still one month left in the year 2095 AD.

Thinking back, this was quite the chaotic year. As he thought over the past year, even Tatsuya couldn’t help but fall into a reverie. The terrorists in April, the international criminal organization in August, then came the foreign invaders during October. Even the word “turbulent” should have a limit.

Still, Tatsuya did not possess the leisure to ruminate and reflect over the year gone by. This was hardly because he bore any pessimistic outlook like “there’s still one month left, who knows what could happen”. Rather, he had a more practical reason before him.

“……Wah-! I still don’t understand no matter how many times it’s been said!”

“Keep it to yourself! There’s no need to holler! Just suck it up!”

“Relax, Leo-kun, Erika-chan……”

No matter if one was a middle school student, high school student, or college student, so long as they were students, this was undoubtedly their most loathed nemesis. The unavoidable obstacle that they were forced to overcome. —The inevitable final exams that were just around the corner.



The usual crowd was currently gathered in Shizuku’s house — more like a mansion, to be precise.

Tatsuya, Miyuki, Erika, Leo, Mizuki, Mikihiko, Honoka, Shizuku, everyone was here and engaged in the study session in preparation for the upcoming final exams.

Despite calling this a study session, the group assembled here were largely quite capable on the written portion of the exam. The only exception here was Leo, whose grades were only so-so, but still in no danger of failing. The area of grave concern was actually the technical skills portion, but that was not being covered in the study session.

Besides from the odd squawk here and there, the mood of the study session closely mirrored that of a colloquial tea party. —That is, until Shizuku dropped the bombshell.

“Eh? Shizuku, can you repeat that one more time?”

“I’m actually preparing to study overseas in America.”

Honoka asked in a frantic manner while Shizuku replied in her usual bland tone.

“But I never heard about that!?”

“Sorry, I was forbidden from disclosing that until yesterday.”

Seeing the completely pale Honoka press on with more questions, Shizuku’s head dropped in a clear sign of guilt. Plainly, Shizuku wanted to tell them from long ago, so in that light, Honoka didn’t push her any further.

“However, are you seriously able to study overseas?”

Honoka’s question was not questioning Shizuku’s ability.

In the modern age, in order to prevent high-class Magicians, and especially their genetics as well as military capabilities, from drifting overseas, various governments heavily restricted unofficial international travel.

The USNA remained allies on the surface, but in reality they were one of the country’s direct competitors in the western Pacific. Hence the typical request to study abroad in America was usually denied.

In other words, saying that she was studying abroad in America hinted at tacit approval.

“Ah, well, we’ve already received approval. Father said that this was because this was a foreign exchange, or something like that.”

“So foreign exchange students are automatically qualified?”

“Who knows?”

Although Mizuki’s question seemed reasonable, any hope of a positive response died when Shizuku tilted her head and replied back. Even Tatsuya was unable to follow any logic that granted special exceptions to foreign exchange students.

“For how long? When do you leave?”

While he wanted to properly analyze the situation, there was simply too little information on hand. Tatsuya frankly gave up on any meaningless pondering and focused back on the situation before him.

“I leave after the end of the term. The duration is three months.”

“So it’s only three months…… Don’t scare us like that.”

Honoka heaved a sigh of relief after hearing Shizuku’s words. It looked like she was expecting this to be a long-term arrangement.

However, according to Tatsuya’s “common knowledge”, even three months was quite a long duration (was there some backroom dealing that led to government ratification).

Nonetheless, that wasn’t important right now.

“Then we need to prepare a proper farewell party.”

So, Tatsuya proposed “something that had to be done” to his friends.




The final exams came and went without any disturbance. Today was Saturday, December 24th. Today was the last day of the second semester and also Christmas Eve.

Since the Third World War until now, the Japanese citizenry remained indifferent towards religion. This was hardly because this was a country of atheists, but more because they subconsciously attributed the one true god that others believed in to be one of the myriad spirits in the world. Thus, there were always preparations for celebratory events, regardless of whether it was the lunar new year or Christmas.

The streets were filled with Christmas cheer.

Every shop was engaged in the annual Christmas mercantile warfare, although even if this was the true topic of the season, simply shopping around by oneself definitely rated as a foolish decision. Setting aside the people who hadn’t found someone yet, if someone decided to throw a hissy fit because they weren’t surrounded by cute girls at this time and ruined the mood for their friends who were enjoying the atmosphere, a beating would likely be unavoidable. (Of course, that’s only the masculine side of things. Young ladies probably want to be “surrounded by strapping young lads”.)

So…… Even if this was the “farewell party”, they still chose to hold it on December 24th. Right now, there was a giant cream cake in front of them with a chocolate plaque that had the words “Merry X’mas” on it. No matter what, this gave off an odd feeling. ……To top it off, according to this restaurant’s style, Christmas should be spelled with “Weihnachten” rather than “X’mas”. Still, this was perfectly charming in its own way.

“Onii-sama, what’s on your mind?”

Eyeing his sister, who managed to bloom like a flower despite being garbed in her school uniform, Tatsuya shook his head to signify that “it was nothing”.

Indeed, in reality he couldn’t simply write it off as nothing. Still, he was being invited as a participant, so he couldn’t ruin the mood for the main act.

“Has everyone gotten their drinks? Then, although this is slightly off kilter from the main theme of a farewell party, but since we rarely get such an exquisitely prepared cake, bottoms up everyone…… Merry Christmas!”

“Merry Christmas!”

Using the clinking of the cups to join the well wishers, Tatsuya responded to his friends’ cries and raised his glass along with everyone else.

In front of the Cafe “Eine Brise”, a “Reserved” sign hung from the entrance.




In central North America on the other side of the Pacific, this was still the day before Christmas Eve. The time was about to turn to the 24th.

Compared to the majority of Japanese who viewed Christmas as a simple celebratory event, those that went through the 20 year long war, or more like the Americans who survived that catastrophe and especially for the new “Americans” after the war, these people embraced Christmas with sincerity, devotion, and gratitude. In order to prepare for Christmas Eve on the morrow, everyone went to bed early. —At least, that’s how it was supposed to be.

In the deepest night before Christmas Eve, several figures were flashing across the street corners of one of the great cities in southern America, Dallas, Texas.

Several more figures leaped across the rooftops from one building to another.

Additionally, several more formed a containment net in the air used against suspicious individuals. Given that they were equipped with Specialized CADs loaded with Flying-Type Magic that hadn’t even hit the market yet, they were probably law enforcement or combat Magicians.

“Halt, Lieutenant Alfred Fomalhaut! You know you have nowhere to flee!”

Standing in front of the fleeing individual, a petite figure wearing a mask that covered the eyes barred their path.

It was the tinkling voice of a young girl that called for surrender. The fugitive, Alfred Fomalhaut, immediately came to a halt upon seeing that tiny figure.

“……What happened? Fred, you are someone who has received the First Class Star of Honor, so why are you deserting?”

The earlier arrogant tone altered. This time, the masked young girl’s voice contained the unease, bewilderment, and childish tones that were expected of her image.

“…………”

Yet, the other side gave no reply.

“There was a series of arson and homicides along this street said to be caused by your Pyrokinesis. That must be a joke, right?”

“…………”

“Answer me, Freddy!”

However, the response the other side gave came not in the form of words.

The young girl quickly leaped backwards.

The only thing she left behind was the cloak she wore on her shoulders.

Without any warning, the cloak that covered the young girl’s body erupted into flames and was burned to ash.

Pyrokinesis — the fire starter ability.

This was not modern magic from any system, but a special power that was once known as a Superpower.

The cloak that the young girl wore over her purple uniform and the easily removable windbreakers and cloaks that the surrounding men wore were not to defend against the cold, but to block their physical bodies from the man’s direct line of sight and magic.

The second the flames vanished, every light in the man’s surroundings winked out.

Setting the target as the origin, every light source within a certain radius was reversed so that no outside light could penetrate this prison of pitch darkness. This was the area of effect magic “Mirror Cage”.

One of the surrounding individuals activated this defensive ability to deny the target any visuals.

“Lieutenant Fomalhaut, in accordance with the special provision granted under federal military law and under my own authority as the commanding officer of Stars, I hereby enact your punishment!”

This declaration was made as if in lamentation.

The masked young girl, Major Angie Sirius, commanding officer of the Stars, raised the automatic pistol equipped with a silencer and aimed at Lieutenant Fomalhaut, who was still imprisoned within the magically created cell of darkness.

Empowered by Data Fortification to ignore all magic interference, the bullet pierced through Lieutenant Fomalhaut’s heart as he stood trapped within the dark barrier.




Despite calling this a farewell party, since they knew that they would be reunited in the spring after the trip and that this kind of study abroad sessions weren’t usually approved, rather than being lonely, it would be more appropriate to say that there were more expectations in the air.

“Hey, where are you going for your study abroad program?”

“Berkeley.”

At Erika’s question, Shizuku only replied back with a single word. This was not because Shizuku was in a dark mood, but because that’s how her personality was.

“So it’s not Boston.”

Among Japanese Magicians, the belief that the center of America’s modern magic research facilities was Boston ran deep. Miyuki’s comment came from this particular background.

“That’s because the East Coast isn’t very stable right now.”

“Ah, the ‘Human Ideologists’ are rampaging over there. We see them on the news quite often these days.”

Mikihiko agreed wholeheartedly with Shizuku’s reply.

“So the witch hunts have now turned into ‘Magician hunts’. Even if you say history repeats itself, this is simply ridiculous.”

Leo coldly retorted.

“It’s not a perfect replication of history. Although we have no idea of the background of the 17th century’s witch hunts, the recent ‘Magician hunts’ and new white supremacist movement are fundamentally two different things.”

Tatsuya chimed in with a more conciliatory tone.

“Still, it may be best to avoid the East Coast.”

Not that Tatsuya’s words were meant to defend the “Magician hunts” in any way.

“I didn’t know about that.”

Miyuki interjected while visually prompting her brother to continue. Catching his sister’s request, Tatsuya continued onward.

“This is because the rosters for both organizations shared quite a few members. However, the member rosters are not something open to the public, so it’s only natural to be ignorant of this detail.”

“I smell criminal activity in Tatsuya-kun’s words…… Let’s table this disturbing conversation here.”

Seeing Erika intentionally crack a joke and shake her head, both Tatsuya and Miyuki chuckled wryly and nodded.

The two of them both knew that this was not the right time and place for that conversation topic.

“Do you know any details about the exchange student?”

Possibly because she wanted to quickly alter the atmosphere, Miyuki’s change in subject was a little abrupt.

“Exchange?”





“The child that will be the exchange student at our school.”

As expected, Shizuku initially missed the meaning behind Miyuki’s words until Miyuki repeated herself before letting out an “Ah” along with an comprehending expression. —But, as usual, it was difficult to discern her change in expression.

“I believe it’s a girl of the same age.”

“So you don’t know anything else?”

“Yeah.”

Is that it? Everyone looked at one another blankly. Tatsuya chuckled as he asked this question while Shizuku nodded her head as if this was perfectly natural.

“……That’s true. No matter how much you cared, it’s not like they would tell you who was going to cross over in your place.”

With Mizuki’s comment, this topic came to a close.



Based on the fact that they selected today for their farewell party, the eight people gathered here didn’t seem to have any special plans for Christmas Eve. Still, it was a little surprising to see that Shizuku, Erika, and Mikihiko were not obligated to attend any family gatherings, which hinted that the Kitayama, Chiba, and Yoshida Families probably held galas for the adults, events where high school freshmen were not required to attend. —And not because their parents made specific arrangements.

Faced with the temptation of unrestrained freedom, they would have liked to party late into the night and deepen their friendship, but since they were all wearing their school uniforms, they wouldn’t be able to stay out too late.

“I think the owner will get a little sour if we stay any longer.”

Such an innocent, but at the same time slightly wicked, phrase stumped the owner of the cafe. (Who said this aloud was irrelevant.) The eight of them packed up their things and prepared to head home.

Honoka and Shizuku took the same bus, so she must be staying over at Shizuku’s place. At any rate, this wasn’t any new headline at magic high schools, though the primary reason was because Honoka wasn’t very close with her parents.

Erika, Leo, Mizuki, and Mikihiko each got onto a train. There was expectation of some theatrics on their part, but plainly these four were a long ways off from that point.

Finally, Tatsuya and Miyuki climbed onto another train without any further concern and happily enjoyed their ride home together. While modern cabins had been designed into private compartments after request, Tatsuya never forgot the ancient maxim “the walls have ears”. Furthermore, Miyuki didn’t have anything to say either as they wordlessly returned home. The real conversation could only begin when the two of them were able to relax in their own home.

“I somehow feel that something is awry with Shizuku’s study abroad program.”

After changing clothes in their respective rooms, Miyuki poured two cups of coffee and the two of them sat side by side on the sofa before Miyuki finally broached her own thoughts.

“Awry…… You do have a point.”

Tatsuya shifted his coffee mug from his lips and, under her brother’s silent urging, Miyuki hesitantly listed her skepticism.

“First of all, the idea that such a magically talented individual like Shizuku could obtain permission to study abroad is already unnatural. That being said, this might fly if she was studying abroad as the daughter of a major entrepreneur and not as a Magician-in-training, but our complete lack of knowledge on the transfer student is too suspicious. Furthermore, specifically selecting this moment to suddenly spring an exchange program smacks of an ulterior purpose. It’s almost as if……”

“As if they’re trying to secretly sound us out? According to Oba-sama, we are under suspicion.”

Tatsuya smirked slightly and continued on as if he was talking about someone else’s business.

“Material Burst. Looks like we can’t just leave this situation alone.”

Once she heard the heavy subject that she was unable to utter spring forth from her brother’s lips, Miyuki’s eyes widened in shock but, at the same time, she seemed to relax into a smile.

“Is that so…… Looks like Onii-sama already took this into consideration.”

“Setting aside the student exchange situation for the moment, after taking into account Oba-ue’s warnings, this is most definitely not a simple coincidence.”

Tatsuya already disclosed the conversation between himself and Maya to Miyuki the day it happened. Exactly why he was under suspicion and who was targeting him.

“Then, is it really Stars……?”

“In that case, being forbidden from making contact with the Major makes this a little difficult.”

As punishment for Tatsuya activating Strategic-class magic without obtaining permission beforehand, Maya forbade him from making contact with the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion. Although he didn’t plan on obediently following orders to the letter, but in order to avoid undue risk, following orders was the smarter move at the moment.

“Even if we asked Oba-sama…… She probably wouldn’t tell us anything.”

“And given that the exchange program has already been ratified, this signifies that Oba-ue has already agreed to this arrangement.”

The Yotsuba Family currently matched the Saegusa Family, who led the Ten Master Clans, so there was no way they would be in the dark about talented Magicians undergoing the foreign exchange program.

“On the other hand, this isn’t a completely negative turnout for us. Even if the opponent they sent was just to sound us out, Oba-ue wouldn’t underestimate them. Rather, there might have been some troublesome turn of events on the American side. Oba-ue’s intent is likely to have us catch them by the tail instead.”

Rather than being a wry grin, Tatsuya’s smile was closer to that of a helpless smile.

“We cannot be certain that is how the situation will unfold…… It will do us no good to overthink this.”

“That’s true. You’re absolutely right, Miyuki.”

No matter what was said, both the comforting side and the comforted side knew that these words were enough to truly let them relax.




After taking the Stars exclusive VTOL aircraft back to base and making her report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff via encrypted communications, Major Angelina Sirius, also known as Angie Sirius, was still in her uniform as she rolled back and forth on the bed in her room.

She flipped over and buried her face into the pillow.

No matter how many times she performed them, she still couldn’t get used to Search and Destroy missions. While she didn’t vomit like she did after first completing this mission, that was only because her physical body had become accustomed to her mental pain.

Yet her mental suffering only worsened.

An American Magician, a Stars member under the direct command of the USNA Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was her comrade on multiple levels, had just been executed by her own hands.

When she heard that this was the duty of the High Commander, the one who was bestowed the title Sirius, she didn’t have any real feelings on the matter.

Even if this was a high honor, she still didn’t comprehend. She still didn’t comprehend the meaning behind killing her own comrades.

She turned over once again and used her hand to cover her eyes from the piercing light. It was only then she realized she forgot to turn off the lights.

At this moment, the doorbell rang. Major Sirius’s lips curled into a wry smile.

Looks like tonight, her meddlesome subordinate was checking in on her.

Stars consisted of twelve units, each led by a captain and then the High Commander. Her subordinate was exactly one such captain responsible for taking care of their own unit.

Originally, he should have no time to interfere with her business—

“Come in.”

Getting up from the bed, Major Sirius keyed the mic leading to the door and made a simple reply before hitting the remote to open the door.

“Sorry for disturbing you, High Commander.”

The one who came in was the expected individual.

Major Benjamin Canopus, call sign “Two” within Stars, captain of the first unit and de facto High Commander when she was absent.

Positions within Stars did not necessarily correlate with military rank, which was a rather odd arrangement for a military unit. It was unheard of for a captain to outrank the High Commander, but it was quite common to see the High Commander and the captains to share the same rank.

Currently, besides the six who held the rank of captain, the other six shared the same rank of major with the High Commander.

If Major Sirius had to voice her displeasure, it was that Canopus was plainly much older than she was yet held the same rank, which actually served to make her uneasy.

“Consolation prize.”

Major Benjamin Canopus looked every inch the high ranking officer. A tough but vigorous man in his forties, the atmosphere around him was completely unlike the soldiers or civilian industrialists who clawed their way through the ranks.

“Ben, thanks.”

There was a steaming cup of honey milk on the table next to the bed. Major Sirius easily accepted the condolences from her subordinate, who was the same age as her father.

This wasn’t one of those glasses used as munitions during combat operations, but a beautiful mug with warm milk with honey that came straight from a thermos. Major Sirius lightly raised the mug and took a sip.

The warm sweetness gradually spread across her taste buds, and the pain in her heart seemed to lessen with it.

“You’re welcome. High Commander, are you finished preparing?”

Major Canopus glanced at the personal luggage lumped together in one corner of the room and asked.

“Yes, pretty much.”

“You cleaned up quite nicely.”

“I am a girl, after all.”

Major Canopus shrugged as he exchanged words with someone who would be the same age as his daughter. He actually had a daughter who was two years younger than her.

“The fact that you care about something inconsequential like your gender…… Is that because of your Japanese ancestry?”

“The idea that politeness and decorum is expected of Japanese people is completely outdated.”

When the other person mentioned her quarter Japanese ancestry, this time it was Major Sirius’s turn to shrug.

Not out of irritation.

Someone who quibbled over trivial matters like this wasn’t going to last in Stars.

“You have a point, though let’s set that aside for now…… Right now, just forget about your mission for a moment and get some quality R&R!”

“This isn’t a furlough, but a secret mission……”

Major Sirius pouted when faced with Major Canopus’s merry lecture.

That expression perfectly befitted the mood of a young girl her age.

“I should say it’s rather depressing instead. Sending me to investigate whether the suspected target is the Strategic-class Magician. It’s one thing if one of the two was the person in question, but there’s a sizable possibility that both of them are not who we’re looking for. Why are they sending me to undertake infiltration that isn’t my specialty…… Even if we have to consider age as a requirement, there should be lots of people with specialist training for this.”

The mission given to Major Sirius was to investigate the culprit behind the titanic explosion observed in the Far East sector at the end of October that was suspected to be caused by Strategic-class magic, which was essentially the true identity of the Magician. Intel tried their best and narrowed down the list of suspects to 51 targets, and among them were two students attending high school in Tokyo. In light of this, Major Sirius was ordered to go undercover because of their similar age (which was purely coincidental).

“Hey, don’t be like that.”

In order to comfort his sighing superior officer, Major Canopus waved his hand back and forth.

“I suspect the Joint Chiefs expect this opponent to be extremely difficult. If the target is truly an existence along the lines of our predictions, then that would make them a dangerous opponent with the firepower to exceed a tactical nuke. Furthermore, we are still in the dark regarding their identity. This way, it’s not hard to sympathize with the Joint Chiefs using pure combat ability rather than training as a criterion when selecting the intelligence officer for this op.”

“I get that.”

“Since our suspected target is a high school student, establishing contact as a student from the same school would be much easier, so the only person who could possibly accomplish this investigation would be you, High Commander.”

Although this was a matter of fact, in reality, there was a host of support personnel working in the shadows to help Major Sirius make contact with the target. Stars was also sending a planet-class Magician to support the major. There was no way that she could be oblivious to all that.

“I understand that as well.”

Hence Major Sirius’s response took this all in stride.

“Why don’t you think about it like this. The High Commander’s mission is to make contact with the suspicious target and cause him or her to waver.”

“Hm…… That’s a much better way to approach this. After all, I’m completely inept at intel work.”

“In that case, go ahead and relax a little. There’s nothing wrong in being a little more cheerful. This will likely make it easier to find our opponent’s weakness as well.”

“Ha…… That’s true. Hopefully it’ll turn out just like you say, Ben.”

After letting out a heavy sigh, Major Sirius set the mug back onto the table and stood up in front of Major Canopus.

“Ben, I will leave the defenses up to you. The rest of the deserters haven’t been dealt with yet, so the task that was originally my responsibility will have to fall to you…… However, the only person I can count on is you.”

“Be at ease, High Commander. This is a little early, but I wish you godspeed.”

At Major Canopus’s affectionate smile and salute, the young lady returned a heartfelt smile of gratitude.





Chapter 2




As in the past, Tatsuya and Miyuki welcomed New Year’s Day for 2096 AD together.

This year, their father also spent the evening at the dwelling of his first love. This actually did not make the situation more awkward for Tatsuya and Miyuki, so there were no complaints.

Neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki were the type to laze about on the holidays. Tatsuya rose at the usual time for school and waited at the threshold for Miyuki, only raising his head when he heard her call out “Sorry for the wait”.

Wearing a long-sleeved, crimson kimono with white flowers, Miyuki gracefully descended down the stairs.

The pearly skin, unadorned with any extraneous makeup, only served to heighten the brilliant red of her succulent lips.

Her silky tresses done up with a hairpin might give off a childish feeling, but that only served to bring out the unique allure of a young maiden in the midst of the mature wardrobe.

In addition, what drew the eyes was not just the products of nature.

Kimonos of the past were designed to confine the chest area, whereas modern designs incorporated a 3-D cut off method. However, the traditional kimono Miyuki wore miraculously tightened the bust and waist area while still keeping with tradition and maintaining a modest appearance.

The breathtaking sight of the world’s cutest younger sister — these were Tatsuya’s true feelings — appeared to be seeking her older brother’s praise.

“Hm, simply beautiful.”

Standing in front of his sister while she was putting on her shoes, Tatsuya held nothing back with his praise.

Miyuki’s face immediately flushed crimson.

“Seriously, Onii-sama… Don’t tease me any more.”

Despite her embarrassment, she did not shift her gaze and playfully pouted at her brother. A lesser man with a weaker immune system would have been annihilated instantly.

“I am not joking in the slightest… Well, let’s be off.”

To be able to be the master of himself even under such conditions, no wonder Tatsuya was the Onii-sama who had lived together with Miyuki for the past 16 years (to be precise, it was the past 15 years and 9 months).



There was an automated car parked outside the door. Nonetheless, an automated vehicle did not imply that no one was on board. The four seater car had an adult male and adult female sitting in the back row.

“Happy New Year, master.”

“Happy New Year, Kokonoe-sensei. Please take care of us in the coming year as well.”

Seeing Tatsuya’s simplistic greeting and Miyuki’s decorous bow, Yakumo replied with a cheerful smile of his own.

“Aya, you’re even more beautiful than usual. Almost as if the divine descended from heaven. If they saw Miyuki today, even the fairies of Sumeru would hide their faces in shame.”

On some level, this was a response filled with Yakumo’s unique flavor.

“Master… I don’t think that is what you’re supposed to say.”

The one who retorted so was the woman next to him.

Seeing that someone stole a march on him, Tatsuya slightly lowered his head to the woman before Yakumo could fire back a response.

“Ono-sensei, Happy New Year. Still, would it be alright if someone saw you with master?”

“Happy New Year, Shiba-kun. First day of the new year and this unpleasant already.”

Originally, Tatsuya was truly getting a little worried, but it appeared that Haruka was already getting sick of him. Thinking back to his usual behavior and previous run-ins, Tatsuya shrugged as he came to the conclusion that “being misunderstood couldn’t be helped”.

“Meeting sensei here was purely coincidental. Today, I am serving as your guide.”

“I see, so that’s how it is. Still, if calling a high school student a guide is pushing it a little… Then that earlier honorific ‘sensei’ may be a little problematic.”

At Tatsuya’s words, Haruka furrowed her brows from the back seat.

Indeed, for a modern high school student, a single day visit to the shrine did not necessitate an adult chaperon.

Simply put, a “guide” was just an excuse, as the actual purpose was for them to “accompany” them.

Furthermore, even for random bystanders, since he was not a faculty member, using the honorific “sensei” might easily lead to terrifying delusions that lay in perilous territory.

“Let’s think about it as we go. Shouldn’t we be leaving now?”

Miyuki made this suggestion after Tatsuya opened the car door. Without paying any heed to the ruminating Haruka, Tatsuya waited until Miyuki boarded the vehicle, closed the door, and took his seat in the driver’s seat. After Tatsuya closed the door, the car automatically took off.



After switching onto the train at the station despite unprecedented attention, the four of them got off at the meeting place again under intense scrutiny and walked for five minutes.

“Hey, Miyuki, you look great!”

This was the first sentence that greeted Tatsuya and Miyuki at the meeting place. Wearing a leather jacket over her long dress, Mizuki was gazing at Miyuki, mesmerized. To the side, even Tatsuya was under suspiciously warm scrutiny.

“Happy New Year, Shiba-kun. Your attire suits you, how unexpected.”

Dressed in a kimono, just like Miyuki, Honoka seemed to be slightly cowed by her classmate’s loveliness, but upon catching sight of Tatsuya’s plain but altogether different aura, her heartbeat spiked and she immediately took on a coy smile.

“Happy New Year. Honoka looks great too.”

Tatsuya wasn’t just offering empty flattery. He honestly believed that Honoka’s kimono was exquisite.

Tatsuya smiled slightly at the ecstatic Honoka and lowered his gaze to his own clothes.

“Since you mentioned this was unexpected, do I really look that out of place?”

“What are you talking about, Tatsuya, it fits you quite well. You look like a boss.”

“So I’m the mafia now.”

The one who interjected with this comment — in earnest or jest, that was unknown — happened to be the jacket-clad Leo.

The three who joined them at the shrine were Mizuki, Honoka, and Leo. Erika and Mikihiko were unable to spare themselves due to the high number of disciples at their respective families, and Shizuku was about to study abroad and was unable to attend due to her father’s business.

“Although you don’t look like the mafia, it’s definitely a rare sight to see a high school student wear a haori hakama[4] so well.”

“Rather than being from the mafia, you look more like a police chief.”

Just as the slightly tardy Haruka and Yakumo said, today Tatsuya wore the traditional Japanese hakama and bamboo clogs. Much like what Honoka and Leo said afterward, he really did look the part. The only thing missing was a pair of swords and a police baton.

“Ho, Haruka-chan. Happy New Year.”

“Happy New Year, Ono-sensei. …Tatsuya-san, and this is?”

Immediately on the heels of Leo’s well wishes, Honoka also followed up with her customary greeting towards a teacher as she kept one eye on Yakumo and the other eye carefully watching Tatsuya.

Upon hearing Tatsuya’s introduction, both Honoka and Mizuki widened their eyes in shock. Honoka was aware of Yakumo’s name, but even Tatsuya was amazed to learn that Mizuki had heard of Yakumo as well.

“I see, so that’s why we’re at the shrine.”

Tatsuya was amazed by Leo’s display of hitherto unknown depths, but this was in no way meant to be derogatory towards Leo.

“So?”

Given that Haruka was unaware of the link, this definitely wasn’t common knowledge.

“Hm? When it comes to Buddhist monks, wouldn’t they be monks from the Tiantai school of Buddhism? The Sanno faith and inner sect is practically inseparable.”

Hearing Tatsuya’s simplistic explanation that was phrased as a question for some reason, the number of question marks floating around Haruka’s head only increased.

“I say, you’re quite knowledgeable despite your youth. I believe you are Saijou Leonhart-kun?”

Ignoring the completely confused Haruka, Yakumo happily struck up a conversation with Leo.

“Eh? Do you know me?”

Faced with someone he met for the first time, Leo responded in a rather serious tone.

“That’s because I watched the recordings for the Nine Schools Competition.”

Yet, Yakumo’s response was also a perfectly serious, uninhibited response, but that only caused Leo to furrow his brows on reflex. This was probably because the image of him wearing a cloak and hood that belonged in a different age and location was likely a memory that would stay with him no matter how badly he wanted to forget it.

After the mutual introductions were finished, the five students and the bald man (in a normal male kimono and not the kasaya) and the young woman walked towards the shrine together. —Fortunately, no one inquired the reason why Haruka came along.

The scenery lining the path had remained unchanged over the past 100 years. However, this scenery was only possible after the world food crisis had passed. This was a scene that moved anyone of advanced age who lived through that time, but Tatsuya and company had nothing to be emotional about.

Without any curved paths, up on a long flight of stairs, past the threshold, they arrived in the courtyard of the shrine. There, Tatsuya abruptly noticed a pair of eyes gazing this way.

This was not an impolite gaze stalking them, but a pair of peeping eyes that occasionally glanced this way.

“Shiba-kun, is something up?”

“No.”

“I gather the foreigners are rather curious about Tatsuya’s wardrobe.”

Despite the disguise, there was no way to escape Yakumo’s eyes. Even Tatsuya discovered the source without using Elemental Sight and, excluding Haruka for the moment, it was guaranteed that Yakumo would notice.

The “foreigner” Yakumo spoke of was a model young woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. Still, in this day and age, just this alone might be insufficient to determine foreign ancestry. Nevertheless, that young woman’s features gave a hint of Japanese descent.

Her age was roughly the same as Tatsuya. After taking into account the differences between white and Asian peoples, the differential would be slight, Tatsuya thought.

“Onii-sama, what are you looking at?”

While Tatsuya only observed the young lady for less than a second, this was enough to rouse Miyuki’s attention.

Following her brother’s gaze, her eyes glinted as an “Oh” passed her lips.

“…What a beautiful child.”

Miyuki softly expressed her internal thoughts.

In Miyuki’s eyes, that young woman was a gorgeous young lady who fully deserved the description “beautiful”.

Her hair and eyes were both brilliant in color. On some level, she had features that rivaled even Miyuki herself.

Regardless, Tatsuya was not observing her for these reasons.

He sent an inquiring look to Yakumo for help — but seeing Yakumo’s highly entertained smirk, he was forced to defuse the situation on his own.

Tatsuya held his sister’s gaze while replying to her complaint in an even tone.

“There’s no way she can hold a candle to you.”

“…You say that every time. Don’t think you can always coax me with that.”

While the literal words might seem like a vibrant counterattack, her embarrassed visage, flushed beet red, undercut any threat behind her words.

“I’m not coaxing you; I truly think that way. Also, that’s not the reason why I’m watching her.”

“Seriously, Onii-sama.”

Miyuki turned her face to one side upon discovering the hidden warning tucked in Tatsuya’s words that could not be ignored.

“…Is there something suspicious about her?”

“In terms of suspicious… I suppose her wardrobe is a little suspicious.”

Tatsuya replied with a wry tone. Because of this, Miyuki took another look at the young blond woman and finally realized what he was talking about.

She wore a bright tan coat over her pleated skirt along with striped pants and a pair of long boots. In truth, if that were all there was then this would not have been worthy of note. However, the length of her coat was approximately the same as her skirt, which was about 10 cm below the hips, so you could only see the bright patterns on the tip of the pleat skirt. In addition, she wore tall boots with a thick cushion that was highly elastic as well as practically see through lace leggings. To top off the ensemble, she carried a bag covered in artificial fur along with a soft hat with animal figures embroidered on the side. All in all, this made her stick out like a sore thumb when it came to modern fashion. It was almost as if she wore a combination of fashion designs from the pre-war Spice Girls. With this in mind, it was hardly amazing for Tatsuya to think that she was highly irregular.

Still, Miyuki knew that her brother wasn’t truly paying attention to external appearances.

“But, that’s not all there is to it.”

Miyuki directed an altogether different, and more intent, gaze toward the young girl.

Maybe it was because she noticed that she had been discovered, the young girl started walking as if nothing had happened.

She was headed straight towards Tatsuya’s group.

She silently passed next to them before departing down the long flight of stairs.

Still, the profound gaze sent his way as they rubbed shoulders was most definitely not Tatsuya’s misconception.




The infiltration mission assigned to Major Angelina Sirius also included blatant misdirection. Among them, the initial contact with the target also included allowing the target to catch a glimpse of herself, so this was successful. Although she was initially worried that hiding her own presence would prevent her target from discovering her, this apparently was a groundless concern, just as her subordinate had said. Still, being discovered so easily didn’t sit very well with her. Ruminating on this, Major Sirius returned and opened the door to the high class condo that served as her quarters for the duration of this mission.

“Welcome back.”

Originally, Major Sirius believed that her roommate shouldn’t have returned yet. However, contrary to her expectations, a welcoming response came from within the house.

“Silver, you’re back.”

The Major used her pet name to greet her adult roommate who intentionally met her at the door.

Her roommate was called Silvia Mercury First. Besides her first name Silvia, the rest were all code names, meaning that she ranked first among the Stars planet-class “Mercury”. Rank Warrant Officer. Twenty five years of age. She was a highly regarded female CO who attained the title of “First” at an early age. In the beginning, Silvia didn’t want to join the military and intended to become a journalist after graduating from college. This time, her outstanding ability in data analysis prompted her selection as Major Sirius’s support personnel.

“Silver?”

This talented roommate paid no heed to Sirius’s words and just stared blankly at her. Feeling that something was awry, the major called out to her again before Silvia replied back her eyes still glued to the major.

“Lina… What can I say about that getup?”

Lina was the pet name for Major Sirius. Given the requirements of the infiltration mission, it was vital to hide her identity and avoid terms like “High Commander” or “Major”, hence she was ordered to use her pet name Lina. Furthermore, Silvia originally possessed an unrestrained personality, so she quickly forgot about the differences in military rank and warmed up to Lina.

Although her word usage did not contain any honorifics when addressing a superior officer, Lina paid no heed whatsoever.

“Ah, you mean my appearance? In order to avoid notice, I spent some time investigating Japanese fashion magazines from the last century. It was really tiring. So, how do I look?”

“…Before I answer the question, may I present another?”

“Sure, go ahead.”

Although Silvia was currently rubbing her temple with the appearance of a grievous headache, Lina didn’t notice anything off.

“Don’t you have a lot of problems walking around in those boots?”

“Indeed, I almost fell over quite a few times. I’m amazed that Japanese girls can walk around in these boots without twisting their ankle.”

“Have you seen any girls wearing those kind of boots?”

The original question had now turned into two questions, but again Lina didn’t notice.

“Hm? Now that you mention it, I don’t think I have.”

Silvia’s expression shifted from pained to helpless.

“Lina, allow me to put it bluntly. Those boots of yours were out of date a long time ago!”

“Eh~!?”





Lina’s eyes widened in shock at Silvia’s words. Seeing this reaction, Silvia’s frustration finally exploded.

“What do you mean, eh! Not just the boots. The leggings and hat are also out of date. That’s the fashion statement from 100 years ago! Also, your wardrobe doesn’t fit very well and is completely unlike something a young girl would wear. There’s no way you can walk outside without drawing attention.”

Lina’s facial expression became stiff upon hearing this reprimand, probably because she was aware of this herself. In reality, she did notice that she drew a lot of attention when she left this morning. Still, at the time this occurred, she thought this was only because the populace didn’t see foreigners very often.

“No matter how badly you wanted to get the attention of the target… Why the heck are you drawing attention from unimportant people as well?”

As if unable to hold it back any longer, Silvia gave a huge sigh of defeat.

“High Commander!”

The tone was very calm and steady, but Lina felt a cold bead of sweat trickle down her back.

“Today, the rest of your itinerary is canceled. Allow me, Mercury, to personally give you a simple and easy to understand explanation on the most up to date Japanese fashion.”

Silvia made this declaration with both hands on her hips. While Lina vastly outranked Silvia in combat prowess, for some reason she couldn’t muster a single counter argument.




After the brief but densely packed winter vacation, the third semester began.

“Densely packed” included taking Shizuku to the airport, where an unexpected “tearful departure” (starring: Honoka and Shizuku, co-starring: Miyuki and Mizuki) forced them into a corner (this wasn’t something that could be solved with brute force), which served as a valuable life experience, but Tatsuya firmly believed that all this would eventually become nothing more than a “wonderful memory”. —At least, it would be too depressing if he didn’t tell himself that.

Supposedly, the new transfer student taking Shizuku’s place in Class A would be arriving today, but Tatsuya felt this matter didn’t relate to him. This person was going to be Miyuki’s new classmate, so it’s not like it was wholly unrelated, but there were enough degrees of separation that he didn’t need to voluntarily greet them.

Speaking of classes, starting on the first day of the third semester, the course schedule would last the entire day. While rumors of the mysterious transfer student in Class A would leak out the moment first period ended, Tatsuya didn’t proactively seek them out and paid little attention to the rumors that drifted in one ear and out the other.

Nevertheless, his aloof attitude was decisively among the minority. During the break time after second period, even he was dragged into the rumor mill thanks to his overly curious friends.

“I hear it’s an incredibly beautiful young lady.”

Seeing the highly excited, or perhaps anticipatory look on Erika as she struck up a conversation finally caused Tatsuya to capitulate.

“She’s got a head of luminous blond hair; even the upperclassmen are going to look.”

“Erika didn’t go catch a glimpse?”

At any rate, the basis for such a lively conversation was nothing more than rumors, which was somewhat of a concern for Tatsuya, prompting his interjection.

“There’s a crowd of people there, so there’s no way to get in.”

“I know exactly where you are most concerned about.”

The moment Leo jumped into the conversation, he already preemptively covered his head with one hand.

A second later, Leo was warbling like a frog that was off tune as he keeled over to the floor while clutching his throat.

(If you knew that was going to happen, then keep any unnecessary thoughts to yourself.)

Tatsuya stared in amazement at Leo, who had been rendered unconscious by the sudden jab to the throat by a rolled up notebook, while the person responsible, Erika, continued on as if nothing had happened.

“I am a girl after all~. No matter how pretty that girl is, I sure don’t want to squeeze through that crowd.”

While Tatsuya supported the idea of not venturing forth specifically to get a look, her perspective that lumped curiosity and lust into one category would draw outrage from any male present.

“That’s because this is a magic high school with no precedent for transfer students. Everyone would naturally be curious about students from abroad. After all, this hasn’t occurred in the past 10 years.”

“I’m not very clear on what happened in the past, but we’re not the only one who received transfer students.”

The one who interrupted was Mikihiko, who came fresh from the Geometry Preparation Room.

“Second High, Third High, and Fourth High all received short term transfer students. The universities also received people who came in the name of research. I heard this from the family disciples.”

“Ah, I also heard about the university. With the incredible edge Flying-Type Magic lent to the military in the Yokohama incident, there are rumors that they are frantically trying to get more information from us.”

Ancient Magic and Modern Magic belonged in separate fields. The Yoshida and Chiba Families both boasted high numbers of disciples, so naturally their level of information was superior to the norm. Apparently, the USNA had invested a surprisingly high amount of personnel. When coupled with the information regarding independent Stars movement he received in November, the situation looked to be grave indeed, Tatsuya thought.

“So the transfer student in Class A is a spy?”

“You moron…”

At the completely uninhibited question from the newly revived Leo, not just Erika, but even Mizuki and Mikihiko looked overcome.

“Leo-kun, you can think about those things, but don’t say that aloud…”

“As students, we have to at least maintain a cordial relationship…”

Despite suffering a double whammy from both Mizuki and Mikihiko, Leo still soldiered onward.

“Why would we need to do that, she’s in Class A, isn’t she? There’s no connection, right?”

“You idiot, Miyuki is in Class A. That’s the transfer student you see once in a blue moon along with the Student Council Vice President. Until the transfer student has fully acclimated to the school, Miyuki will at least have to watch over her for appearance’s sake. So long as this affects Miyuki, there’s no way we can remain unrelated.”

Erika immediately overruled Leo’s rebuttal.

Unwilling to draw more trouble, Tatsuya inwardly sighed “What she said”.



That “relationship” materialized faster than expected.

Nay, more like among the myriad possibilities, the earliest opportunity mercilessly manifested itself.

In the student cafeteria, the late arrivals were Miyuki, Honoka, and the young girl with blond hair and blue eyes. Upon seeing the young girl, although Tatsuya was not overly amazed, he still felt a little surprised.

The hair and eye color he had already heard about along with the rumors of great beauty. And if her beauty was all there was to it, then Tatsuya’s nerves had already been honed by Miyuki. The source of his surprise was not this, but that this was the same girl he saw at the shrine — or more appropriately, the young girl he noticed at the shrine.

“Excuse me, may I sit with you?”

The young girl spoke fluent Japanese. Her heavy accent couldn’t be helped, as expected of a transfer student studying abroad in Japan — or an infiltrator disguised as a transfer student.

“Of course, please go ahead.”

Her gaze swept over Tatsuya. Still, there was no need to put on any airs, so Tatsuya quickly acquiesced.

“Lina, let’s go get a tray first.”

“Tray… Ah, you mean edibles. Understood.”

Tatsuya’s group had already obtained their food.

Under Miyuki’s urging, the three of them walked towards the cafeteria counter.

And because of this, the ruckus surrounding the counter was greater than usual.

Overawed by that formation, the other students seemed to scamper out of the way faster than usual as well.

“Those two together are certainly a force to be reckoned with~”

As a beautiful girl in her own right, but certainly not commanding such presence, Erika couldn’t help but sigh in appreciation.

“They look like they’re getting along quite well…”

Didn’t they meet for the first time today, that was probably what Mizuki really wanted to say.

“Hey, Tatsuya… I think I’ve seen her somewhere.”

“Wow, old school, much?”

As soon as Leo opened his mouth to speak, Erika immediately broke in. Although she knew Leo was saying this because of the young girl’s features, Erika still interposed because Leo’s phrasing was too direct.

“…Now that you mention it, indeed.”

“Eh, Shibata-san as well? Unless she’s an artist or model… But that’s rather unlikely, right?”

As apparent from Mizuki’s supporting comment, Mikihiko’s words were pure speculation.

Of course, Tatsuya knew exactly what the truth of the matter was. Rather, the inability to recall such a conspicuously dressed young lady was even more astonishing. Just as Tatsuya hesitated whether to dispel his friends’ bewilderment, the topic of their conversation had already returned with Miyuki.

Tatsuya felt a massive amount of eyes turned this way. While pretending to go about their business yet unable to contain their curiosity, gazes were resting on them from all four directions. Though Miyuki still drew the usual amount of stares, the number of surreptitious looks had increased substantially compared to usual.

“Sorry for the wait, Onii-sama.”

As if wholly ignorant of these details, Miyuki sat next to Tatsuya as if this was the most natural thing in the world.

“Tatsuya-kun, allow me to make a few introductions.”

Naturally, Honoka sat directly across from Tatsuya and spoke towards the young girl by her side.

“Angelina Kudou Shields. You might have heard about this already, but she is the transfer student that will be joining us in Class A starting today.”

Hearing Honoka’s introduction, not only Tatsuya, but the other three also revealed bemused expressions.

“Honoka, don’t just face me; shouldn’t you introduce everyone else?”

As the person in question, the transfer student espoused everyone’s sentiments.

“Eh, ah, s-sorry!”

“…Well, that’s our Honoka.”

“Indeed, that’s quite like Honoka.”

Faced with Erika and Mizuki’s commentary, which were more like barbs landing right on target, Honoka flushed red and was unable to speak a single word.

“Then, allow me to make introductions. This is Angelina Kudou Shields from America.”

After Miyuki made the second round of introductions, the transfer student’s hair swayed slightly as she bowed slightly in her seat.

“Please call me Lina.”

As she said this, her eyes slightly squinted as she revealed a dazzling smile.

Her blue pupils, not the color of water or ice, but reminding people of the sapphire of the sky — azure.

The two wavy tresses on the sides of her head were secured by ribbons and, if released, would likely trail to waist length. They might be even longer than Miyuki’s hair.

For a high school freshman, such a mature gaze didn’t go very well with that childish hair style, but this perfectly coincided with that perfect blend of shock and beauty, with a degree of familiarity to go along with it.

Looks like the majority of the stares were definitely because of her. Upon hearing Miyuki’s second introduction, Tatsuya led the way with the introductions in place of his friends who were a little overcome by that dazzling smile (especially the 2 boys) and wore an “Oh?” expression of shock.

“Class E, Shiba Tatsuya. In order to differentiate from Miyuki, please call me ‘Tatsuya’.”

“Thank you. And please call me Lina. Also, I would greatly appreciate it if you don’t use honorifics.”

“I understand, Lina.”

“Nice to meet you, Tatsuya.”

Likely out of habit, Lina extended her hand across the table, which Tatsuya lightly grasped from beneath.

This was just a handshake, and not something ridiculous like a lady extending her hand for a kiss.

“Is Tatsuya by any chance Miyuki’s brother?”

Her azure eyes betrayed a hint of wavering, but Lina pretended nothing had happened and pressed on.

She doesn’t seem to be able to hide her expressions, Tatsuya thought as he paid heed not to accidentally laugh and just smiled and nodded his head. —Just now, Miyuki clearly referred to Tatsuya as “Onii-sama”, which clearly hinted at their relationship.

“I am Chiba Erika. Please call me Erika, Lina.”

One of Erika’s strong points was not cowering during these situations.

“My name is Shibata Mizuki. Please call me Mizuki.”

“Saijou Leonhart, but Leo is fine. I’m a little rough and speak like this, so please don’t take offense.”

His tone was coarser than usual, but not enough to notice.

“Yoshida Mikihiko, please refer to me as Mikihiko.”

Buoyed by her courage, Mizuki, Leo, and Mikihiko all presented themselves.

“Erika, Mizuki, Leo, Mikihiko. Nice to meet you.”

Without asking anyone to repeat themselves, Lina remembered all their names on the first try. This was only the beginning, but she succeeded in attaining a favorable impression at this first crucial step.

However, upon hearing Mikihiko pronounce his name as “Mikhiko”, this purely Japanese name seemed to have stumped her as an American.

“It’s a little hard to pronounce, so if you can’t say Mikihiko, go ahead and use Miki.”

If the person in question had given permission, then everything should be fine. Yet, coming from someone else, and especially out of Erika’s mouth, there was no sense of cordiality. At least, that was how Mikihiko felt as he prepared to reject Erika’s proposal.

“Ah, is that so? Then allow me to do so. Miki, is that OK?”

Nonetheless, when that charming smile stole his thunder with “is that OK”, Mikihiko could only capitulate.



Lina, who intentionally selected buckwheat from the menu, was busy dueling her chopsticks while trying to contain her frustration and answer the occasional question. Of course, everyone was very courteous and didn’t ask any impolite questions. Just as everyone was about to finish eating, Lina finally appeared to master her chopsticks. Seeing this, the questions bubbling up from the Class E members were finally voiced by their representative, Tatsuya.

“Speaking of which, is Lina a blood relative to Elder Kudou?”

The typical term among Japanese Magicians was “sensei”, but Tatsuya personally did not prefer this title. Instead, he used the general catch-all term “elder”, which was an honored title for retired officers when phrasing the question to Lina.

“I remember that the elder’s younger brother went to America and started a family there.”

That was an age when Magicians were encouraged to marry across international boundaries. At the time, the news that the younger brother of Kudou Retsu, the “wiliest” among the world’s Magicians, had headed for America and started a family with an American Magician was a topic of heated debate.

“Ara, I’m amazed you heard about that, Tatsuya. That’s definitely news from a long time ago.”

Tatsuya’s conjecture appeared to be right on the money.

Additionally, for an American Magician, saying that Kudou Retsu’s younger brother went to America “a long time ago” made sense.

“My mother’s grandfather is Shogun Kudou’s younger brother.”

She used the word “Shogun” for General. Tatsuya didn’t hear her incorrectly.

That was the term the Magicians from Europe and America used when referring to Kudou Retsu, who spent many years in a leadership position among the Japanese Magicians. Even if she had a quarter of the ancestry, no matter how fluently she spoke Japanese, she was still an American Magician through and through.

“Thanks to that, I am able to come here to study abroad.”

“So Lina didn’t come here out of her own volition?”

Erika inadvertently asked.

The nervousness and anxiety that Lina revealed didn’t appear to be Tatsuya’s misconception either.





Chapter 3




Those that prowl in the dark of night are not restricted to those from sinister backgrounds.

That citizens could move about freely without the threat of hoodlums — and completely free at that, was thanks to the tireless efforts on part of the “apostles of order”. Tonight, a young man who was (supposedly) one of these pillars of order was grousing to his male companion.

“Seriously, one trouble after another……”

“…………”

“Hasn’t our crappy luck from last year already come to a close?”

“…………”

“Something must have happened. This way, it’s really easy to tell if they’re illegal aliens or foreign invaders.”

“……Investigating them is our job. We’re employed because of this rash of incidents, so quit your yapping!”

At the same time as he used his clear and capable voice to advise his superior, who was still softly muttering “Things like this shouldn’t be happening at all……”, he also sucked in a breath.

“Yes, this is Inagaki.”

Hearing a short burst from his ear set, Inagaki immediately replied back in a terse tone.

“……Acknowledged. We’ll be at the scene shortly.”

After turning off the transmission device, Inagaki swept a severe gaze over his superior, who wore a languid look on his face as he surveyed his surroundings.

“Inspector, 5 bodies. Cause of death is the same as the ones from before. Just as before, there are no external injuries.”

Hearing Sergeant Inagaki’s report, Inspector Chiba Toshikazu sighed as his eyes drifted to the skies.

“And all their blood must also be gone. ……Seriously, 5 weird corpses every month. There should be a limit to trying to draw media attention.”

Without alluding to the victims or murderer, Inspector Chiba Toshikazu was only sighing to elucidate how troublesome this all was. Still, amid the inconvenienced expression on his face, his pupils flashed with the razor sharp gaze of a hunter.




Angelina Shields was currently putting on a performance worthy of being called an exhilarating entrance.

On the first day of her transfer, her appearance alone was such that no one on campus was unaware of her.

Before this, the throne of the most beautiful girl in school belonged solely to Miyuki. This was the combined consensus of the upperclassmen and female student body as well.

However, with the addition of Lina, the title of “Queen” had morphed into “Twin Beauties”. Add in the fact that the two of them often moved together, this only served to deepen the impression that “her beauty rivaled that of Miyuki”.

The blonde hair that shone luminously beneath the sun and the azure pupils that put even sapphires to shame.

The dark tresses deeper than the night itself and the brilliant eyes that surpassed the luminescence of black pearls.

Miyuki and Lina, equal in beauty, yet diametrically opposed in appearance. Light fairly shone from the school campus that housed the both of them.

Just having that level of beauty was enough to send tongues wagging—

“Miyuki, I’m starting.”

“Feel free to begin whenever, I will leave the countdown to you, Lina.”

The two of them stood facing each other across a distance of 30 meters.

Between them, a small metal ball with a diameter of 30 cm was placed on a thin rod.

Although there were many similar instruments in the Practical Skills Room, all of their peers abandoned what they were doing and concentrated all their attention on Miyuki and Lina.

No, not just their peers. In the observation stands on the second floor, there were quite a few Year 3 students who possessed the freedom to select their course schedule.

Mayumi and Mari were included among them.

“……Magic Power that can rival Miyuki, do you think that’s possible?”

“On some level, she’s the American representative to Japan, so this isn’t impossible. Nonetheless, it’s still hard to believe that someone in the same age bracket as Miyuki can stand up to her Magic Power.”

“I agree. Well, seeing is believing. I’ll only believe it when I see it with my own eyes.”

“We are here precisely to verify the truth of the matter.”

The goal of the practical exercise was for both sides to activate their CADs simultaneously, with the winner seizing control of the metal ball in the middle. Not only was this practical exercise easy to manipulate, there was a high competitive feel to it as well.

Precisely because of its simplicity, this was a simple way to determine the difference in power between the two sides.

Since starting this exercise last month, Miyuki had already reached a level that her peers could not hope to reach. The difference between her and the rest of her peers was so great that the instructors had deemed that continued practice against other students had already become meaningless.

It was an open secret that not even the newly returned Student Council members (and Public Moral Committee members) who came to challenge Miyuki upon catching wind of this were her match.

Yet, this Miyuki was about to pit her might against a transfer student.

Given that the upperclassmen completely lost face despite wholeheartedly accepting the outcome (of course, Miyuki wasn’t the type to aggrandize her accomplishment and was rather embarrassed over the whole ordeal), Mayumi and Mari had to attend this exercise.

“Three, two, one……”

The moment Lina called out “one”, both of them put their hands on the dash board.

“Go!”

The last signal erupted from both of them.

Miyuki tapped the board with her fingertips, while Lina pressed her whole hand onto the board.

Stillness and action, their true colors were reflected in their opening motions. However, this only reflected the physical side of things.

Dazzling arrays of psions were combining and exploding on the Eidos of the metal ball that served as the target. Since it was a light that could not be seen by the naked eye, closing one’s eyes served no purpose.

Some of the observers who had not mastered the suppression magic interference techniques pressed their temples and couldn’t stop shaking their heads.

The light faded after a brief moment as the metal ball slowly rolled towards Lina’s direction.

“Ah, I lost again.”

“Fufu, I’m ahead by two rounds now, Lina.”

Lina loudly proclaimed her unwillingness to accept defeat while Miyuki smiled slightly while secretly heaving a sigh of relief.

Based on their reactions, it was blatantly obvious that the victor of this contest (not that this was a real contest) was Miyuki. Despite saying “ahead by two rounds”, this phrase that was normally reserved for the victor didn’t leave an indelible impression of an overwhelming victory, more like—

“……They’re truly neck to neck.”

“In terms of Activation Speed, the transfer student is actually faster, isn’t she?”

“Hm, but Miyuki wins in interference strength, so she seized control before her opponent’s magic was finished. Initiative versus power…… Rather than calling this a pure contest of strength, this is more like a tactical victory.”

In Mayumi and Mari’s eyes, in terms of single systematic processes, the two of them possessed equal Magic Power.

—Afterwards, the same exercise was repeated four times, with both sides splitting the result 2-2, so the day ended with Miyuki still ahead by two rounds.



Noon in the neighboring cafeteria.

Since Lina was sitting with them today, it couldn’t be described as their usual arrangement. Since transferring a week ago, she had been tugged this way and that and sat with a different group each time for lunch.

By maximizing her networking possibilities, she could be said to be a model transfer student. In terms of eating with Tatsuya’s group, this was actually the first time since the first day of her transfer.

“You’re quite popular, Lina.”

“Thank you. I’m glad that everyone is so nice.”

At Erika’s undisguised praise, Lina opted against replying with meaningless, embarrassed humility and came back with an uncaring attitude.

There was no way to tell if this attitude was her personality talking or simply her cultural background, but Tatsuya and company (Erika excluded) found this to be a refreshing change of pace.

“Still, Lina was surprisingly capable. Though I knew that anyone selected to study abroad definitely has the skills to back it up, I seriously can’t believe you can match Miyuki to that degree.”

“No, I think I should be the one who is surprised.”

At Mikihiko’s praise, Lina widened her eyes in disbelief.

—Speaking of which, at least when compared to Miyuki, Mikihiko found Lina easier to talk to. When speaking to Miyuki, Mikihiko still spoke formally while he could speak more casually with Lina.

“I used to be undefeated in high level competitions like this, but I can never seem to beat Miyuki, and when against Honoka, I may win in overall skill but I still lose in complexity of design. As expected of the Japan, one of the strongest magical countries.”

“Lina, practical exercises are just that and not a competition. I believe there’s no point in dwelling on victory or defeat.”

“Magic competitions are very important. While these are only practical exercises, I believe specifically choosing highly competitive subjects where victory matters is the only way to improve.”

Faced with Miyuki’s humble deflection, Lina charged forward with her counter argument, completely unafraid of any potential clash.

This was just the way she was, which was a refreshing change of pace in its own right.

“The will to compete is very important during contests, but surely there’s no need to carry that beyond the event itself, right? Practical exercises are ultimately only practice and are fundamentally different than practical skills examinations that determine personal skill.”

“……True. Maybe Tatsuya is right. I might have been a little too excited.”

“Excitement isn’t a bad thing. Miyuki has also become more motivated with a new opponent taking the field, so on that point, I should thank you, Lina.”

Lina was frankly nodding her head in assent to Tatsuya’s words in the beginning, but now she turned an incredulous expression towards him.

“It appeared! Tatsuya-kun’s sis-con commentary!”

To one side, Erika gave off an “Ah ha” comment while pretending to sigh.

“Ah…… Oh, so that’s how it is…… Tatsuya and Miyuki are on very good terms.”

Swallowing a more impolite outburst, Tatsuya seemed to feel that the gaze Lina sent his way was rapidly dropping in temperature.

“Speaking of which, Lina, although this isn’t really major……”

Detecting the atmosphere heading in a wonky direction, Tatsuya changed the subject.

“What is it?”

She sent a chilling gaze his way, but it was bereft of any condescension, so this was probably an act to parallel Erika’s practical joke.





While this was the result he was hoping for based on his observations, there was no guarantee he was correct. Still, this was Tatsuya, and Tatsuya was not so tender that he would shut his mouth and retreat from just this.

“If I recall correctly, isn’t ‘Angie’ the usual nickname for ‘Angelina’?”

This was not supposed to be a groundbreaking question.

At least, that was the case for Erika, Mizuki, and Honoka, who were sitting at the table with them.

Yet, for one brief moment, Lina’s expression definitely faltered.

“No, you remembered correctly, but the nickname ‘Angie’ isn’t as rare as you think. For comparison, I had a classmate in elementary school called ‘Angela’ who was referred to as ‘Angie’.”

“So that’s why Lina prefers to be known as ‘Lina’ and not ‘Angie’, eh.”

Tatsuya nodded his head in comprehension.

He never gave a hint that he discovered how badly Lina faltered just then.




First High did not have any student dorms.

Since there were only nine magic high schools in the entire country, it was inevitable that students from abroad would be present.

Thus, while student dorms didn’t seem to be entirely out of the question, in this day and age, besides a few specialized boarding schools that viewed student dorms as an integral part of the curriculum, facilities such as student dorms were no longer in service.

In the modern age, HAR (Home Automation Robot) has already entered the mass market, purchase of daily items can be done online and delivered directly to the door, so students can freely live on their own without discomfort, making student dorms a redundant facility. Owing to the above reasons, most of the students who were unable to return to their family homes largely chose to rent housing close to the school. As a transfer student, there was nothing odd in Lina renting an apartment. Her house was only two bus stops from school, which was considered close proximity thanks to modern public transit. The reason that she did not rent a personal studio or a one room apartment and instead chose a small, family-sized apartment was because Lina wasn’t living on her own.

“Welcome back, Lina.”

“Silvie, back already?”

The moment Lina opened the door to the apartment, Warrant Officer Silvia, who was serving as her support on this mission, immediately greeted her as if she had been waiting for her arrival for quite some time.

“It’s quite late now, isn’t it?”

Lina smiled wryly upon hearing this after taking a roundabout way home and walked towards the dining room in her uniform. There was,

“Mina, you’re here.”

A young woman wearing a tense expression greeted Lina. She was standing in front of the table and had probably just conversed with Silvia.

“Yes, sorry for bothering you, Major.”

The woman called Mina replied back in a stiff tone. With a perplexed smile on her face, Lina took a seat by the table.

“Please sit, Mina. Silvie, could I trouble you for some tea?”

Normally, Silvia would completely ignore the chain of command and fire back with “Given that you’re a girl, you should fix your own tea”. However, she wasn’t someone who couldn’t read the atmosphere.

“Is milk tea OK? Mina, would you like a cup?”

“Ah, OK, sorry for the trouble.”

Silvia’s question seemed to terrify Mina, but at least she loosened up a few degrees as she replied back.

The woman’s full name was Michaela Honda, or Mina for short. She shared Lina’s Japanese-American heritage, but unlike Lina, Mina could fully blend in based on her appearance. Perhaps her skin tone was a little darker? This degree was not enough to raise eyebrows in Japan.

She was one of the spies who had entered Japan ahead of Lina’s group. That being said, this wasn’t her original occupation either. Her true identity was a magic researcher attached to the Department of Defense who specialized in Release-Systematic Magic. She was a talented woman who participated in last November’s black hole experiment in Dallas. She volunteered for this mission in search of an alternate breakthrough for “annihilation reaction energy conversion” after the debacle at the Dallas Research Center.

Like many magic researchers, she was also a Magician. Unlike the fake students who came this month under the guise of mutual research, she had infiltrated the magic universities under the identity of a salesperson and engineer from the Japanese branch of Maximilian Industries, “Mia Honda”. Speaking of which, her current housing was directly next door to Lina’s rented apartment. Despite not being combat or intelligence personnel, she still served as support and was concealed enough to serve as an active asset for this infiltration mission.

“Do you have any clues?”

Lina’s initial question was posed for Silvia, who had just sat down after setting down the cups.

“I’ve gone over the publicized information, but so far I haven’t found any new data.”

“I see, looks like there’s no way to get results quickly from that direction.”

This time she turned towards Michaela.

“How about your side, Mina?”

“Nothing here either…… Sorry.”

Michaela had somewhat relaxed a little before curling up again out of anxiety.

It wasn’t Lina’s intent to make everyone so high strung like she was a strict person. However, ever since the end of last year, Michaela had always been extremely nervous around Lina since day one. Rather than saying (because) there was a divide between researchers and combat personnel, the more likely cause (reason) was because Lina stood at the pinnacle of USNA Magicians as “Sirius” despite her youth. Simply telling her to relax wasn’t going to achieve anything. Even though it had already been two weeks since that day and they were now able to have some degree of interaction, this was only restricted to everyday conversation. In the short term, Lina herself knew that it was impossible to achieve the same degree of an easy working relationship she had with Silvia.

“How’s your side Lina, did you get closer to the target?”

Hearing Silvia’s question, Lina’s expression seemed to be enveloped in fog.

“I feel that I haven’t gotten closer at all.”

Lina sighed and wore a bitter smile on her face.





“I haven’t gotten a single piece of critical information and it seems like they’ve already seen through my disguise.”

“……What are you talking about?”

“Tatsuya asked me ‘isn’t Angie usually short for Angelina’ and almost scared me half to death.”

“Couldn’t that be a coincidence?”

“I have no idea. I’m such a failure. So I guess I’m really not cut out for this (type of work), eh?”

Lina kept sighing deeply. Silvia filled her cup with milk tea again. Noticing that Silvia and Michaela were sending worried looks her way, Lina managed to find her second wind.

“Don’t worry about it, my opponent is only a high school student after all. He shouldn’t able to discern my identity as Sirius. Even if he suspects something, there’s no way he’ll stumble onto something concrete.”

It didn’t take a genius to tell that these brave words were only empty talk. In the beginning, Lina had already been tasked with identifying their target under any circumstances, so saying “not getting identified” was just empty talk. Silvia was well aware of this, but decided to abstain after considering that this would damage morale too badly. In addition, nor could she say that their opponent was no ordinary high school student.




After handing a robe to his sister, who just rose from the bed of the psion wave examination device in nothing but her underclothes, Tatsuya watched the examination results while his customary, machine-like poker face contained slight traces of concern that could not escape Miyuki’s eyes.

“……Are you troubled by something? Onii-sama, please feel free to tell me anything. No matter what Onii-sama needs to say, I am always willing to listen.”

Rather than calling this an overreaction, this was more like overly motivated.

As this thought ran across Tatsuya’s mind, he was mystified as to how to respond and what expression to greet this with, and in the end only adopted a dry chuckle.

“No, rather than saying what troubles me, I think this time it’s my own problem. Since the upper ceiling of the scale of magic design exceeded original expectations, the processing power of the CAD can no longer keep up with your Magic Power. I was planning on setting a larger magic calculation area inside…… You’re over thinking this.”

“I apologize.”

“What are you apologizing for? I should be the one praising you.”

Gently caressing his sister’s hair as she kept her head bowed, Tatsuya smiled warmly at Miyuki when she raised her head.

Miyuki followed her brother’s lead, more like mirrored her brother’s smile. Everything was fine up until this point—

(……This is not the time to start blushing.)

Cognizant of the inherent danger — largely presented by the cleavage peeking through the gaps in the robe — Tatsuya quickly picked up the conversation.

“Looks like Lina transferring into the same class became an excellent stimulus.”

Upon hearing Lina’s name, the brilliant blush across Miyuki’s face immediately faded.

“Indeed…… This may sound a little arrogant, but I’ve yet to meet an opponent of her caliber before.”

This was not because the mood had been ruined. Miyuki wasn’t the sort of woman who would be upset that another woman’s name came from Tatsuya’s lips. Her expression contained a visible degree of transparency for another reason altogether. A quiet, burning fighting spirit lurked in Miyuki’s eyes.

“Oh yes, Onii-sama, your question earlier this morning was indeed?”

“You noticed?”

Tatsuya chuckled lightly as he said this.

“As I suspected, Lina is ‘Sirius’.”

Tatsuya declared this as his smile was replaced by a sharp expression.

“As surmised, there’s no way to hide these things from Miyuki.”

Seeing Tatsuya laugh once more and raise his arms to stretch, Miyuki couldn’t keep a straight face any longer and smiled mischievously while raising a finger towards Tatsuya.

“Of course, because Miyuki watches Onii-sama more closely than anyone else.”

Tatsuya intentionally laughed aloud. There was no way to tell whether he felt that Miyuki was joking or he was simply trying to regard it as a joke.

Seeing her brother laugh, the only thing on Miyuki’s mind was how badly she really wanted to know what Tatsuya was truly thinking about.

Rather because the basement (more like underground facility) air conditioning was still running, it was more like a flimsy robe covering her undergarments was the true reason why neither one of them could relax.

Miyuki needed to return to her room and change, so the two of them returned to the house.

What covered Miyuki’s slim and exquisite legs were not a pair of black leggings or tights, but black stockings. The clothing around her upper body was rather loose and there was a hint of Miyuki’s pale flesh between the mini-skirt and stockings.

This was all well and good while standing, but the moment Miyuki sat down, he immediately noticed that, wasn’t this a terrible situation? — And exactly why was this terrible, Tatsuya calculated.

Unaware of her brother’s feelings — not that he had any way of telling — Miyuki placed the coffee mug in front of her brother.

Except today, she sat across from Tatsuya rather than on the sofa next to him.

She did not adopt a lotus-like posture and place her legs atop one another.

Rather, she placed her knees together and kept them slanted diagonally.

This was a very amorous posture which hinted at the secret charms beneath her skirt.

Uncertain of Miyuki’s intention (the superficial intent was obvious, but the true meaning remained elusive), Tatsuya elected against focusing on that.

After making that decision, Tatsuya’s gaze ceased wavering.

Across the table, he could detect a trace of displeasure from Miyuki, but he chose not to call her on it and began to speak while watching Miyuki.

“Continuing our earlier conversation, I believe there is a high possibility that Lina is ‘Angie Sirius’.”

Last month, Tatsuya had received a warning from his aunt Yotsuba Maya that the USNA’s Army Magician unit Stars had begun investigating the Magician responsible for the Strategic-Class Magic “Material Burst”. At the time, Maya had made it very clear that Tatsuya and Miyuki were likely to be included among the possible suspects.

Tatsuya believed that Lina coming to First High was likely one aspect of the ongoing intelligence war.

“Currently, the problem is that we have uncovered Sirius’s identity despite our opponent’s efforts to conceal her identity. In addition, we can also see that they are trying to unravel our true identities.”

It was only natural that Tatsuya was confused, given the inexplicably weak personal and mental defenses around Lina, at least by USNA standards. The reason behind this remained beyond Tatsuya’s grasp at the moment.

“Furthermore—”

Maybe he would burst into laughter upon learning the truth, but right now Tatsuya wore a serious expression as he continued his analysis.

“Why would USNA send Sirius, who is practically their trump card, over here?”

Miyuki had long since switched gears and was following Tatsuya’s example by adopting a serious tone of her own.

“Just so. Based on the observations in the past week, I feel that Lina’s strengths do not lie in intelligence work. I fear that her real mission may lie elsewhere and her disguise is meant for that.”

“ ‘Sirius’ simply covers too many angles……”

“Assuming Lina is Sirius…… Her infiltration mission may just be a cover. Her real target may lie somewhere else.”

“To force the USNA to invest Sirius into an international mission…… What could it be?”

They might be dwelling on this too much, but fortunately the two of them were still in the dark.

“I have no idea…… However, I think right now we don’t have to focus on that.”

From an omniscient perspective, Tatsuya’s speculation had already drifted off subject as his tone suddenly lost its earlier intensity.

“We are very fortunate that America has provided you with an excellent opponent, Miyuki.”

Nonetheless, his earnest tone did not disappear.

“Indeed, Onii-sama.”

At her brother’s sincere tone and gaze, Miyuki changed her tone.

“Compete against Lina with all your might. We were just talking about it this morning, but we should care about victory or defeat. That will push you to a higher plane than ever before.”

“Yes.”

“Mutual competition as the fuel for growth applies towards Lina as well, but right now you don’t have to worry about that. This is a rare opportunity.”

Hearing Tatsuya’s powerful words, Miyuki revealed a serene smile without a trace of unease.

“That’s true. Also, Miyuki has Onii-sama with her. So long as Onii-sama is by my side, I will fear no foe, even if they be Sirius herself.”

Tatsuya’s words spoke of a rival and not an opponent.

There was a slight feeling from Miyuki’s words that she was a little off topic.

However, in the face of Miyuki’s limitless faith, Tatsuya nodded his head without any hesitation.




There were quite a few alterations in Tatsuya’s extracurricular activities. On paper there were only two, staying in the library or patrolling the grounds as a member of the Public Moral Committee, but the latter presented many interruptions.

Enough to give one pause and consider if someone was conspiring something.

Today, this feeling was particularly prominent.

While Public Moral Committee members were bestowed with the right to carry CADs on campus, Tatsuya typically didn’t use one while executing his duties to the committee.

Originally, CADs were tools that shortened the time needed to activate the Four Systematic Magics. It was only of limited use to other magic, such as Outer-Systematic Magic, Non-Systematic Magic, Ancient Magic, and especially if Non-Systematic Magic was only releasing psions to the point that the lack of a CAD would not seem unnatural at all.

After accidentally revealing his ability to use Gram Demolition during the Nine Schools Competition, Tatsuya restricted himself to Non-Systematic Magic outside of class since the start of the second semester. This was more than enough to handle any trouble, so there was no need to carry a CAD.

The reason he carried the committee’s CAD while on patrol was because of its demonstrative power. Although they did not possess great power as a deterrent, Tatsuya customarily returned to HQ before his patrol and put on CADs on his two wrists.

As was usual, Tatsuya headed for the committee HQ after class today and saw Lina’s figure. Even from afar, that blaze of golden hair was unmistakable.

Suppressing the urge to flee based on premonitions of trouble, Tatsuya worked hard to keep his voice level.

“Good morning.”

He had long become accustomed to the committee members’ greetings that paid no heed to the time of day. He walked past the crowd — which was actually no more than 5 people, and deftly finished the preparations on his hands.

“Ah, Shiba-kun, perfect.”

Unfortunately, Tatsuya was nabbed by Kanon.

His ability to hide his disappointment was the product of his daily training.

“What is it?”

Tatsuya’s voice did not betray any subjective or objective warmth. It was both a strong and weak point for Kanon that she paid no attention to details such as this.

“This is Shields-san. I believe you already know her?”

It wasn’t much of a question. Of course, Tatsuya’s only option was to nod.

“Shields-san wishes to observe the Public Moral Committee’s daily activities. I believe she wanted to see how Japanese magic high schools govern themselves. Shiba-kun is on duty today, so would you be able to bring her along?”

How troublesome, Tatsuya thought. He was unclear on Lina’s intentions, but he felt this definitely raised the probability of troublesome events happening. This was a guarantee, since he was sure they would run into male students (all the upperclassmen) enamored of Lina watching him with sharp gazes. Even if he was spared the jealous glares within the committee, he didn’t dare to imagine how incredibly irritating it would be to walk around campus with Lina in tow. Alas, both Lina’s request and Tatsuya’s appointment were perfectly logical turns of events.

“Understood.”

Tatsuya had no options but to offer an immediate and unconditional surrender.



Lina had recently transferred here so there wasn’t much of a surprise, but this was the first time they were walking together alone. Strictly speaking, with all the students milling about, the two of them weren’t walking alone on campus, but the uncomfortable atmosphere wasn’t likely to change depending on whether other people were present or not.

First of all, in Tatsuya’s defense, the uncomfortable atmosphere wasn’t because he had an amazing beauty like Lina walking next to him, but because Lina never let up on that inquisitive feeling of hers. Every once in a while, she would secretly sneak a “Hm~~” peek at Tatsuya, and, despite her efforts at trying to conceal these looks, Tatsuya felt that they were only digging her deeper.

Even so, Tatsuya couldn’t just directly come back with “You’re a spy, aren’t you”. The pressure just kept building like a volcano ready to burst.

“Did Lina’s old school not have this system?”

Tatsuya felt that he couldn’t stand this silent drama any longer (technically, they were only a dozen yards from HQ). What sort of heavy silence is this, Tatsuya thought as he indulged in his rarely seen sense of public service and provided the initial question. —Now that he thought about it, that was a terribly malicious question.

“Eh? Uh……”

Malicious, because he could see Lina’s anxiety.

Rumor had it that everyone bestowed with the title of “Sirius” was a front line fighter through and through. Surely it wasn’t possible that Lina never went through infiltration training, Tatsuya thought, unable to decide if he wanted to laugh or cry.

“……It can’t be helped if a Year 1 student doesn’t know anything about it.”

Feeling somewhat guilty for Lina’s distressed state, Tatsuya tried to give her a way out. There was no need to shred her disguise, since putting all the cards on the table would only make things more troublesome.

“Eh…… Ah, just so. That’s the reason why I wanted to understand the secret to why a Year 1 student could join in this activity on this campus.”

She wasn’t really adept at handling curve balls, but she had a good head on her shoulders, Tatsuya thought. She was nimble enough to grab the lifeline that other people threw to her, which might actually put her on a better footing than his own sister.

As he suspected, he was being stabbed left and right by all sorts of gazes. However, probably wary of leaving a negative impression in front of the transfer student, no one actually made a move against him.

As such, Tatsuya led Lina through the primary practical exercise rooms and research labs. This patrol accompanied with explanations gave the impression that he was giving a campus tour.

Lina halted her footsteps at one end of the building that ran alongside the research labs near the staircase that led to the neighboring building.

“Are you tired? Do you want to head back?”

Of course, he knew that this wasn’t the real reason she stopped. He was only using this to open the conversation.

“No, I’m fine.”

Her tone gave the impression that she wasn’t sure where to begin.

“What is it?”

At Tatsuya’s urging, Lina finally broke free of her hesitation.

“Tatsuya is a substitute — a Course 2 student, correct?”

“That’s true, is there a problem?”

It had been a long time since someone came straight out with that question. Is it this again? Rather than having that feeling, he was rather refreshed by this and replied with a question of his own.

“When I asked Miyuki as to why you wore a different uniform than everyone else in Class A, she told me in a rather annoyed voice.”

Lina burst into laughter when she recalled that incident. That certainly sounded like Miyuki’s button being pressed, Tatsuya chuckled wryly.

“But, when I asked Kanon earlier, she said that Tatsuya stands in the top tier among Magicians in First High.”

When Tatsuya heard Kanon’s name pronounced as “cannon”, he unilaterally interpreted it as canon rather than cannon — calling Kanon a cannon was a little too insulting.

With so many unnecessary things running through his head, comprehending what Lina was trying to say took more time than usual.

“Tatsuya, why are you pretending to be a poor student? And since you are pretending to be a poor student, why did you so easily reveal your true strength? Tatsuya’s behavior is highly irregular so I don’t understand why you went about it the way you did.”

After listening to Lina’s question to the end, he finally understood what Lina really wanted to say.

“I have no idea what you asked Chiyoda-senpai, but it’s not like I was pretending to do nothing. I truly am a poor student.”

Fortunately, Lina gave a detailed explanation in order to convey her question and didn’t just leave Tatsuya hanging, or he really might have embarrassed himself. He really needed to curtail those unnecessary thoughts, Tatsuya thought.

“The practical skills examination is dependent on speed, scale, and strength and is based on international standards. However, victory or defeat in live combat does not depend strictly on those three variables. Originally, physical prowess plays a huge role in live combat. While my practical skills examination labeled me a poor student, I can hold my own in a fight. Simple as that.”

That was the indisputable truth. Tatsuya believed this was enough to answer the question, or on some level, deflect the question.

“……I do agree that practical skill scores and combat capability are two different things.”

However, Lina’s words were not expected and seemed to hint at something more.

“I too was someone who wasn’t amazing at school but was a Magician who was useful on the battlefield.”

A suspicious aura seemed to slowly emanate from Lina’s body.

“Isn’t that wonderful?”

The warmth in Tatsuya’s eyes vanished.

“I can tell, you’re good.”

Before that cold, or rather, steely gaze, Lina let out a dazzling smile.

This was not a blossoming flower, but the beauty of a razor sharp blade honed to its finest.

Lina’s hand suddenly moved!

Tatsuya swiftly intercepted the striking palm.

The edged right hand that Lina used the smallest possible movement to stab forward with was caught at the wrist by Tatsuya.

The thrusting palm aimed for Tatsuya’s chin was intercepted before it could even reach the throat.

Lina shifted the captured right hand into a pistol shape and stabbed forward with her index finger.

A terrifying claw came whistling towards Tatsuya’s face.

In a flash, Tatsuya flung Lina’s right hand to one side.

Lina frowned as the psion light gathered at the tip of her index finger was dispersed before the blow landed.

“How dangerous.”

“I believed that you would dodge it.”

“Care to explain this for me?”

“Before that, can you let go of my hand? That stings, and this position is a little embarrassing for me.”

In order to fling her hand to one side, the distance between Tatsuya and Lina’s bodies had closed quite a bit. From the side, it looked like Tatsuya was attacking Lina — and forcing a kiss.

Tatsuya immediately let go of Lina’s hand.

However, his eyes gave no hint of shame or remorse.

“Seriously, that hurt. You even left…… Huh? No trace? Precision strength control?”

Lina wore a perplexed expression as she used her left hand to pull back her right sleeve.

“After striking at the pressure point on another person’s face, letting you experience a little pain is the least you deserve.”

“That was only a simple psion block that contains no threat whatsoever. The most it could do was give the impression of being struck by a gun.”

“I do believe that more than justifies your violent treatment.”

Even after seeing such a warm smile, Tatsuya’s expression didn’t relax in the slightest.

Lina could only sigh and raise both arms.

“I get it, I get it. Please forgive my rudeness, Tatsuya-sama.”

Lina reset her attitude and formally bowed to Tatsuya before raising her head.

The once severe expression on Tatsuya’s face suddenly curved at the corners of his mouth for some bizarre reason.

“……Is there anything else?”

“No, that is sufficient. I think we can talk normally in the future. Though this refinement doesn’t seem like Lina at all.”

It appeared that the change in corners of Tatsuya’s mouth was because he felt that it didn’t suit her.

“In what way am I not refined!”

“Your character.”

He wasn’t sure whether she would get the meaning of a vague term like “character”, but given Lina’s fluent Japanese there should be no problem, hence Tatsuya skipped the explanation time.

Then, whether this was a blessing or a curse, she successfully interpreted his words.

“There’s no such thing! At the very least, I’ve been invited to tea with the President!”

Propelled onward, Lina was trying to prove her elegance.

“Oh……”

Hearing this, Tatsuya chuckled lightly.

Amid this laughter, there were hints of chilling frost.

On reflex, Lina covered her mouth.

In Tatsuya’s expression, she could see Mephistopheles[5] grinning at her.

“The President, eh……”

There were many in positions of power that could give even Magicians, capable of murder without any weapon, pause. Even in a country like Japan that had very low walls, there were a few special people in power that even Magicians had to take periodical antidotes to defuse the poison in their bodies before meeting them.

In the USNA, the only Magician who could meet the President face to face was probably……

“I’ve been had, right……?”

Unwilling to accept the outcome, Lina glared at Tatsuya, but this debacle was entirely on Lina herself.

“My infamy precedes me. It was pure coincidence that the conversation went the direction it did. In regards to that question, I believe Lina imploded on your own, correct? After all, Lina was the one who instigated this.”

And that is what it’s like to suffer in silence. The only thing Lina could do was continue to stare at Tatsuya in frustration.

“So, should you explain why you went about doing this?”

“……I just wanted to know how capable Tatsuya is.”

“How capable I am? For what?”

Lina’s eyes drifted away from Tatsuya as he stood there frowning in suspicion.

“Nothing really…… It was out of pure curiosity.”

“Curiosity…… You did all of this just for that.”

Easily seeing through this blatant lie, Tatsuya continued to murmur.

Lina sulkily gave a small “Hmph”.

“……Strictly speaking, that is true. Actually……”

Muttering softly, Lina dragged her gaze back to Tatsuya.

“I wanted to know if you wanted to come to the USNA.”

“Me, to America?”

“In my opinion, you have such a high level of skill yet are relegated to such a lowly position, wouldn’t you want to be on a stage that gives you the recognition you deserve. While a Magician’s grade is assessed in America much like the international standard, there are still places that aren’t like that. America is a free and diverse country. There’s no way that you would be relegated to a substitute simply because you’re lacking in one area. I believe that Tatsuya will be recognized as befitting your true potential.”

“An interesting declaration.”

Faced with an unexpected invitation, Tatsuya’s attitude softened somewhat.

“In that case……”

Seeing this, Lina immediately charged into the breech.

“If that was the unadulterated truth.”

However, Tatsuya’s satire immediately took the wind from her sails.

“Lina, where exactly is this unorthodox place that prizes merit above all else? Say, Arlington?”

Arlington used to be a naval academy, but was now one of the primary providers for Magicians and magic researchers in the USNA military.

“……Yes. But, there are other places.”

“Lina, assessment based on merit is designed to select the right way to use tools.”

Despite the fact that Tatsuya’s tone remained mocking, it lacked the chilling cold that deafened the soul.

“In regards to selecting Magicians best suited for the military, Arlington and the JSDF are two sides of the same coin. Although regarding their broad-mindedness, there might be a few differences.”

Most of all, it sounded as if Tatsuya was teasing a friend.

“Oh well, forget it.”

“Eh……?”

Suddenly Tatsuya murmured in a tone of “it doesn’t matter anyways”.

Lina was unable to follow this abrupt change in gears and could only reply with a befuddled voice and expression.

“You were just trying to test my skills, right?”

“Uh…… Yes.”

“Then let’s leave it there. Please refrain from doing such things in the future.”

Isn’t it about time for you to go? Urging her to do so, Tatsuya’s expression was now no different than usual.

Lina could no longer tell the difference from the usual Tatsuya.

“Don’t you have anything you want to ask me?”

It was understandable that Tatsuya wanted to pretend that scene never happened. This was also in Lina’s best interests. However, she had no idea why Tatsuya would do this, or his intentions.

It was incredibly fortunate that Tatsuya wasn’t asking any questions and Lina knew she could be trampling on his kind gesture, but she couldn’t resist her own question.

“Ask what?”

“What do you mean? Like…… My real identity or something, don’t you want to know?”

“Don’t worry about it. There are some stones in the world better left untouched.”

Lina wasn’t certain if he was being truthful or evasive.

The human being known as Shiba Tatsuya was too incomprehensible for Lina.

“……You, are incredibly irritating.”

Tatsuya only shrugged his shoulders and turned around at Lina’s blunt accusation.

At the same time that she was following his back, Lina was clairvoyant that the word “irritating” didn’t refer to its superficial meaning.





Chapter 4




January 14th, AD 2096, Shibuya 11:00 p.m.

Late at night on a Saturday, though there were no cars on the street, it was filled with young people.

There were no cars in sight due to the changes in both the traffic system and the customary working hours. The self-driving (auto-pilot) individual transportation trams work around the clock. Besides, in a big city like Shibuya, there is no need to employ these vehicles that are meant for communal use, as by using the motorized sidewalks that have been laid out underground, one can reach the train station easily.

Moreover, in the present age, where infrastructure for working from home has been upgraded, there is no longer any need for one to stay back in the office till late at night. In case of urgently needed work, the current trend in businesses is to settle it at home and submit it back to the company via a private line. Modern offices are places for business negotiations, not places for paperwork. In the first place, as long as one is doing an honest business, the need for deliberately scheduling business negotiations at midnight would disappear.

Shibuya at night is the town of young people where adults’ figures are not seen.

In fact, one cannot see this kind of scene at this time in any town other than Shibuya.

Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, Roppongi… Before the war, those towns flourished as shopping districts for young people; but now, seeing young people wandering and gathering late at night is a scene that one would only see here in Shibuya.

During the era of chaos which spanned two decades, at different periods, in Shinjuku, Ikebukuro and Roppongi, as a result of the destructive activities caused by the foreigners, together with the extreme devastation caused by the xenophobic[1] activities of the raging native youngsters in response to the foreigners’ deeds, emerged widespread vermiculated ruins. Measures for the thorough restoration of public order were taken during the course of reconstruction, and these towns have been rebuilt as fairly dense bustling towns.

But, Shibuya was the exception.

Since before the war, the degree of devastation had deepened and the disputes between youngsters intensified, and thus, as a result of being the first to expel the foreigners, in contrast Shibuya had been spared the absolute total destruction that had befallen the other towns. And as the lawlessness of the nights in Shibuya were left alone consequently even now, one cannot flatly assert that one end result is better than the other.

If this was such a lawless area, be it day or night, the “Redevelopment” initiated by the government, and the local municipality who has become very much intolerant to the absence of order as compared to the pre-war days, would probably have proceeded, as one might guess. The current administrative authorities have become considerably strict regarding the restrictions on private rights related to real estate.

However, Shibuya holds completely different façade during daytime and night.

During the daytime, it is a business center where honest company employees busily come and go.

At night, it is a pleasure quarter where youngsters loiter, with the affectation of outlaws.

As they can’t round them up at once, it’s difficult for the authorities to take the plunge into redeveloping the city.

And on this very evening as well, at the beginning of the New Year, there were many youngsters gathered on the streets making as much of a racket as they wanted, laughing, flirting, and exchanging blows.

Among them, with finely chiseled features, and a sturdy build, a young man’s figure could be seen.

Dressed in a sweatshirt and jumper pulled over it, which was unthinkably light clothing in the deep of winter, Leo was walking with faltering steps in Shibuya in the dead of the night. Although we use the word “faltering” here, his legs and feet were properly covered in jeans and sneakers. However, judging by the steps he was taking, he seemed to have no specific destination in mind.

Leo had one bad pastime. No, rather than a pastime, it was probably a habit.

The habit of roaming.

Not walking, running, nor shouting, but roaming in the night.

As the dead of the night drew near, he would want to randomly wander about in uncertainty.

Leo thought that this was due to his instincts that have been carved into his body’s genes.

He is the third generation of the “Burg Folge (Fortress Series)” that was developed in Germany in the initial days, which put the technique of tuning Magicians via genetic manipulation in practical use for the first time in the world.

The Burg Folge was a body tuning technique developed with an emphasis on improving the durability of the body. In those days, in order to raise close quarters combat ability, thought to be the weaker point of magicians, rather than strengthening magic ability, the Burg Folge, which strengthened the physical abilities contained in genes, brought forth a breed of “Super soldiers that can use magic”, or “Enhanced humans that can simultaneously use both superhuman physical abilities, and magic technical abilities”, both of which were more apt descriptions than calling them tuned magicians.

Although Chimera-fication measures were not included in the tuning methods, it is not difficult for one to imagine that large sized mammals that are much more tenacious than humans had been used as a reference at the inception of the genetic remodeling method.

Not by removing the body’s limiter with external means – it was already known at that time that such a method would have a high probability of damaging an individual’s magical technical ability – but by raising the performance of the physical body.

Possibly as a result of that unreasonable genetic remodeling, many among the Burg Folge’s first generation died during childhood, and even the majority of those who grew to adulthood went mad and died.

Leo’s grandfather was one of the few survivors.

Leo had a fear.

Someone looking at him as a person from the outside would be unable to see it, but he has been living his life while carrying that fear deep down in his heart.

He wondered if he would also go mad one day.

With a non-human factor devouring his human factor, he wondered if he would end up losing his senses.

Since he thought that, by releasing his impulses, whether or not he would be able to delay the moment when his creaking heart broke. He tried to be loyal to his own impulses. He knew from example that his grandfather was able to freely live a natural span of life.

That was why he didn’t go against his impulse of “wandering at night”.

At the whim of this impulse, underneath the moon, underneath the stars, underneath the jet-black clouds, he was walking aimlessly.

One night in the center of the city, one night in the shopping districts, one night in the suburbs, one night on a secluded mountain. Without destination. On a whim, he chose a road by the mood of the day.

That he came today to Shibuya was merely pure coincidence.

There was a figure of a young man in a dark suit wearing a gray trench coat, which, even though new, had creases here and there.

“Huh? Erika’s older brother, Mr. Inspector?”

The person who just passed by was coincidentally an acquaintance. It was only that, but Leo called out to the young man. –Merely at a whim, since one doesn’t always call out to an acquaintance upon seeing him each and every time.

The next moment, a wave of noise surged towards him.

Leo’s voice was by no means big. It was just enough to call a passing person to stop.

Despite that, gazes one could certainly not call friendly were drawn from both sides of the street.

“You, come with me for a moment.”

Responding with a smacked expression was the man who was walking next to “Erika’s older brother”. Leo also remembered the face of the man, who was at the age by which it has become a little painful to call a young man. He not only remembered the face, but also the name.

“Inagaki-san, right? What is it all of a sudden?”

Without answering the question, which could also be treated as rude, Inagaki grabbed Leo’s left wrist.

Although shaking it off would be easy, Leo quietly followed Inagaki.

He was brought to a small bar inside of a back alley. Although “BAR” was written on the signboard, it was a store’s appearance that Leo felt did not need the use of western-style characters at all.

“Master, I’ll borrow the upstairs.”

Inagaki called to the proprietor of the shop, who was polishing a glass on the other side of the counter, and went up the stairs at the far end without waiting for a reply. Leo was brought to a cramped small room which was filled only with four chairs placed around a small round table. The doorway being a bulky, airtight constructed door, looking like the hatch of a spaceship, was awfully mismatched to the worn-out interiors.

“I’m still a minor.”

Leo said so in a joking manner, forestalling Inagaki, who was on the verge of talking after rotating the handle with both hands, firmly locking the door.

Next to Inagaki, who looked like he chewed on a sour bug, Chiba Toshikazu pleasantly – not in the sense of having fun, but in the sense of deep interest – laughed.

“Saijou-kun, right? You did well to spot us. Even though we should have had properly concealed our presence.”

Just with that, Leo understood what Toshikazu was trying to say.

“…Have I perhaps interrupted an investigation?”

Toshikazu seemed to be surprised by that good guess.

“Heeh… You’re not just brawn. Well, Erika wouldn’t support a mere muscle-brain, I suppose.”

Though Leo reflexively frowned, aside from whether it was from goodwill or malice, since he was aware of the fact that he was taught techniques, lent specialized weapons, and also supported in various ways, he refrained from rebutting.

“Isn’t Mr. Inspector’s House mistaking the way of raising daughters?”

The counterattack was at best a degree that would be knocked down for abusive language (would be disgusting).

“That’s for sure.”

Toshikazu said so with a wry smile. But, contrary to his light tone, the light within his narrowed eyes felt like something deep-rooted.

Sensing danger of having crossed where he shouldn’t, Leo shut his mouth.

“Don’t mind the investigation. We were just trying to conceal our presence in order to avoid meaningless trouble; it’s not like we were tailing anyone. Since late at night here, this is a place where the police would draw looks of resentment.”

“Looks of resentment, huh… It’s certainly like that.”

Leo, looking like he was reminded of something, nodded deeply. That gesture conveyed that he felt sympathy more towards the police than the young people of this town.

If goodwill is turned, the attitude will soften; it’s one of the most basic patterns of interpersonal relationships. (This may not necessarily be true with the opposite sex though.)

Therefore, the glint in Inagaki’s eyes towards Leo became much friendlier.

“Inspector, isn’t it just the right time? Why don’t you ask him ‘that’?”

With that alone, Leo naturally didn’t know what “that” was, but he did not urge on an explanation. Leo was calmly watching Toshikazu, who nodded and turned to face him.

“Saijou-kun, what business do you have today in Shibuya?”

“I have no business in particular.”

“Hmm, do you often come to Shibuya?”

“No, not often; I only come here occasionally. I also strolled here on New Year’s Eve.”

“Two weeks ago, huh… Then, do you know of the strange events that have occurred in the shopping districts?”

Inagaki didn’t stop Toshikazu, who was trying to reveal details of an incident over reporting restrictions. At any rate, Inagaki knew that by tomorrow it would be a “scoop”.

“Strange events? I thought that such things happen every day. By the way, Mr. Inspector, weren’t you in charge of Yokohama city? Why are you investigating the incidents of this town?”

“We are members of the Police Department. We’re transferred here and there all over Japan. Because of that, we are now investigating the incident of continuous unnatural deaths in the metropolitan area.”

Words which lightly and smoothly flowed out. However, Leo was not misled by his tone.

“Unnatural deaths… Strange murders? And continuously?”

Furrowing his eyebrows, Leo asked. Toshikazu revised his evaluation of Leo upwards without showing any sign of doing so.

“That’s right. Well, since it’s something that will be known by tomorrow…”

Saying that, Toshikazu and Inagaki exchanged looks. Inagaki nodded, and removed from his overcoat pocket a mobile terminal. Opening the folding-type terminal, he brought up the image file on the screen. Seeing the photo on the terminal, switching in a slideshow, Leo breathed and swallowed his saliva.

“The latest victim was found in Dougenzaka Park three days ago. The estimated time of death is around 1:00AM to 2:00AM.”

“Right in the middle of the town!?”

Leo thought that “right in the middle of the town” was a strange expression, but he couldn’t come up with a better wording to properly express his feelings.

–He probably thought that this kind of thing happens in sparsely populated areas.

“Leaving aside the daytime, it would not be strange even if something like this happened in the middle of the town at night. At least in this town.”

However, as Toshikazu answered back with a bitter expression, Leo couldn’t help but nod “You’re right”. Leo also knew from experience that the present Shibuya had an unusual dual nature.

“Therefore, I would like to ask something; do you happen to know anything about a strange guy? I don’t mind even if it is just rumors that you have heard.”

“There are a lot of strange guys loitering around this town in the dead of night. Specifically, what kind of guy do you want to know about?”

To Leo’s justifiable complaint, Toshikazu, knowing that it’s not such a case, leaked a wry smile.

“Certainly, it’s not clear. But, the investigation would have been fairly easy if we knew the criminal’s features…”

Leo was silently staring at Toshikazu, who was pondering “From where should I begin to explain?”

“Well… The victims’ corpses we showed you earlier.”

Inagaki did not try to interfere. He also had no intention to stop his superior, who had started leaking secret information of the investigation to a civilian.

“The cause of death for all deaths was unnatural. There was no trace of external injury to find on the seven people.”

“There was no injury? Was it poison?”

To the question of Leo, who changed his expression, Toshikazu shook his head.

“The tests of drug reactions are all negative. And even though there is no injury, about ten percent of the estimated blood has been lost from the victims’ bodies.”

“All the victims?”

“All the victims.”

“I see… That is indeed ‘unnatural death’. Rather than strange murders, it’s a strange incident.”

Neither being frightened nor feeling uneasy, Leo muttered so in an amazed voice.

“While it may seem a supernatural phenomenon, the incident is reality.”

While being amazed at Leo’s attitude, Toshikazu returned the original question.

“So, I wonder if you happen to know a guy likely to perpetrate this by imitating something occult. Particularly with foreigners these days, such as strange rumors, which spread out about those guys.”

“Foreigners these days, huh…”

From before being asked again, Leo crossed his arms, but before long, uncrossed them with a look of resignation.

“My bad, no one comes up in my mind.”

It was a rude, or rather, a muddled tone as if to say “What kind of manners were those?” but without feelings of wonder or hatred.

“I’m stocking up on jokes from a friend.”

“Eh, no, it’s alright. That sort of thing is the job of the police, and it is also not limited to sniffing around and not keeping an eye out.”

“But Inspector, it is Shibuya at night, you know? I think that having adults, and moreover, policemen, out to ask various things will be difficult.”

“…Well, that might be so, but…”

Even without the need to receive indication again, both Toshikazu and Inagaki actually realized the difficulty of an investigation. Otherwise, they would not go as far as to reveal the secret details of an investigation to a boy who was simply an acquaintance.

“I also don’t intend to stick my nose in the danger. And even if I could see it, I have confidence in my sense of smell.”

“Really? Then.”

“Inspector!?”

Having said that, making a high school student cooperate in a criminal investigation was going too far and too dangerous. Inagaki hurriedly raised his voice as gesture to stop, but Toshikazu brought out a business card from his breast pocket.

“If you find anything, mail me here. You manually enter for the first time, and it’s automatically updated from the second.”

The good sense of Inagaki was ignored by both Leo and Toshikazu.

“It’s really strict. Well then, if I find anything, I’ll let you know.”

Saying so, Leo stood up, with one hand easily turning the airtight lock’s handle that Inagaki had to use two hands to turn, and went downstairs.




January 14th, AD 2096, USNA Washington D.C. 11:30 local time.

January 15, 01:30 Japan time – Midnight.

Lina, who had gone to bed, was woken up by her housemate Sylvia.

“Sylvie, what is it?”

Lina also became a regular officer not less than three years ago; even if reckoning after she took the post of Stars’ High Commander, she had a military career of one year and a half. She grew accustomed to being dragged out of bed in case of emergency. Regaining her consciousness in an instant, she requested an explanation from Sylvia in a clear voice.

“It’s an urgent communication from Major Canopus.”

To the answer which was returned by Sylvia, Lina silently ran towards the communication device.

“Ben, sorry to have kept you waiting. Excuse me that it’s audio only.”

[Likewise, it is I who should say so for disturbing you while you were sleeping.]

As far as Lina knew, Benjamin Canopus was a man of common sense even within Stars. Among the first Stars class, he might have the most common sense. He, while being aware of the time difference, in other words, while knowing that here in Japan was midnight, called Lina. And it could not be for a trivial matter.

“I don’t mind. What on earth happened?”

『We’ve found the whereabouts of those who escaped last month.』

“What!?”

The desertion incident of the star-of-the-first-magnitude class of Stars, Alfred Formalhaut, which occurred last month, was not only limited to the scandal of Stars, but also gave a great shock to the USNA executives.

That incident did not end with First Lieutenant Formalhaut’s disposal by Lina’s hands. The fact is that in the same period, seven magicians, and also magic factory masters had escaped from the USNA forces. Within them, although it was the satellite class of the lowest rank, the members of the Stars were also included. The mission entrusted to Lina by Major Canopus back then was the pursuit and disposal of these fugitives. It was about them, he was saying that, their whereabouts were found out.

“Where is it!?”

『In Japan. After landing at Yokohama, it seems that they are currently hiding in Tokyo.』

“Why in Japan… And moreover, in this Tokyo!?”

Lina turned around in surprise. But Canopus also didn’t have the answer to this question. It was not only Lina who asked that question, and it was not only Canopus who could not answer it.

『…The Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to dispatch an additional tracker team.』

“Does the Japanese Government know?”

『No, it’s a secret operation.』

In a pursuit operation of fugitives coupled with espionage and combat in a foreign territory, the impression given to the partner country government was totally different. There was even a possibility that it could be considered as a serious provocative act to sovereignty, and develop into a rupture of diplomatic intercourse. Lina was once again aware of how the Pentagon attached importance to this matter.

『High Commander, we will pass on the instructions from the General Staff Headquarters. The mission currently given to Major Angie Sirius should assume a priority of second degree, and you should give top priority to the tracking of the fugitives.』

Lina, once after taking a deep breath, answered to the communication device.

“Ben. Please convey to the HQ that I accept it.”

『Roger. High Commander, take care.』

The communication cut with those words of worry.

“It looks like I won’t be able to sleep any longer tonight”, Lina thought.




In the classroom at the beginning of the week, the strange murders event was the hot topic.

Sunday morning, every news company came out with what was a veritable festival of articles about the continuous strange murders event in an attempt to compensate for having been out-scooped by the 2nd ranked domestic news site. That their conduct was rather manic, or rather their screws were loose, to the extent that they were trying to make it up to their disappointed subscribers, one could say it was an act of gratitude.

However, because of that, the news quickly spread like wildfire. —But, the main point especially emphasized the occult aspect, agitating the sensation.

“Morning~. Hey, hey, Tatsuya-kun, did you see yesterday’s news?”

However, the only people who understood that they are being agitated, but still dared to take advantage of that, were probably people around Tatsuya’s age. As usual, definitely without being led, the friend who would seem likely to dance upfront was the very first voice that called out.

“News, you mean about the ‘vampire’?”

Even though it was obvious, he was just trying to make sure that this was the general etiquette. Then Erika, as he thought, nodded happily.

“About that, it’s after all impossible that it would be done by a single criminal, right? Is it a professional organized crime? My vote is that it is an illegal organization dealing in organs and blood.”

Before Tatsuya sat in his chair, she lightly sat on his desk and twisted around and brought her face closer.

At this time, Tatsuya thought “It’s really insignificant, but that body is flexible” which was a really insignificant thing to be thinking about, so he put on a serious look on his face and shook his head.

“If that’s the case, then I don’t understand why only ten percent of blood was extracted.”

So as not to cause trouble in vain to the world, it was certain that the authorities wanted to conceal it, but the fact that the victims lost about ten percent of blood had spread to the society along with, stirring up the complaint of the “Vampire event”.

“Wasn’t there an intention of killing? Didn’t they think possibly to use the blood for a blood factory if using it efficiently?”

“If it’s the case, then they would not leave the corpses in the town. Besides, it is a mystery that there was no mark that blood was extracted, either.”

In the articles, “After extracting blood with a needle, they erased the traces by magic”; although they also assumed magicians were involved, it was impossible to erase the injection mark permanently with a single use of healing magic.

“Hmm, I see… It’s certainly strange that there is no scar.”

“As said on TV, is it a homicide by occult means?”

Furrowing her eyebrows from the seat nearby, rather with a somehow nervous expression, Mizuki joined to the conversation.

“Occult means, huh… If there’s really such thing as vampires, then it’s likely to be known long ago.”

Modern Magic, in the process of systematization theory, was welcomed by those who conveyed Ancient Magic from the other side of the legendary veil. If the hobgoblins or the like with substance really existed, their existence should have been disclosed along with that of the “wizards”. Tatsuya had at least thought so.

“Then is it Tatsuya’s opinion that till the bitter end, it was an act done by humans and not by occult means?”

“What about you, Mikihiko? Do you think that Youkai or demons, those sort of beings are involved?”

He struck back at Mikihiko’s question with the content’s same question.

Mikihiko chimed “Hmm…”, shaking his head back and forth.

“…I can’t think that this is the work of a mere human, but I can’t make an assertion…”

To the awkward answer of Mikihiko, Tatsuya revealed a nasty smile.

“Speaking of the occult, until just 100 years ago, magic was the prime example of the occult.”

Erika promptly leaned forward in excitement.

“Does Tatsuya-kun think that this crime is related to magicians?”

“I haven’t clearly thought about it till that point. Neither the street cameras nor the Psion radars that were installed captured any reactions.”

Soon after having finished saying so, Tatsuya, as he has reconsidered, shook his head.

“…However, if it is a high ranked magician, he could trick the radars, and if it is a practitioner able to use a Mental Interference External Systematic Magic, he could also commit the crime in the center of the city without anyone noticing.”

“It’s unpleasant. It’s good that the Humanism trend doesn’t become stronger.”

Mizuki muttered in a gloomy voice.

The current age’s “Humanism”, flatly speaking, is a kind of anti-magician movement.

It’s a movement that attempts to ban the use of magic, saying that “Magic is not a power permitted to humans,” which is the essence of the cult ideology for a sub-sect of Christianity.

The assertion “Humans should live with only the power accorded to humans,” or perhaps one should say from the public stance named “Humanism”, is a party which has been expanding their influence in recent years in the central east coast of America.

If it’s just “stop using magic”, then there is no particular harm (many people would agree), but radical elements of Humanism conducted violent acts aimed at the rejection of the very existence of magicians. Even in the USNA they receive their own authorities’ surveillance as a form of anti-crime reserve troops (A violent action, USNA always monitored organizations).

“Now that you mention it, I saw those sheep clamoring for that on the TV.”

“Morning, what are you talking about?”

Interrupting Erika’s speech as usual, in the seat in front of Tatsuya — it’s obvious that from the beginning, there was no “homeroom teacher” who would propose a seat change — was Leo.

“Don’t you seem quite late today?”

Raising his hand to greet him, Tatsuya asked so. Judging from the impression of his outward appearance, it may be surprising, but it is unusual for Leo to come at the last minute just before the opening so much without margin (to arrive late).

“Ah- I had a little bit of minor business and ended up staying up late… Aside from that, what were you talking about?”

“It’s the usual ‘Vampire event’ we are talking about.”

Leo frowned at Mizuki’s answer.

A little muttering “Again…?” leaked from his mouth, and at that precise moment, the terminal displays information for the course start. Without time to follow that up, the morning’s idle chatter came to a close.




There was no golden haired companion beside Miyuki, who appeared in the school cafeteria.

Tatsuya didn’t feel any doubt or dissatisfaction because he also did not make a separate appointment. Because of that, this question, not that he was that interested, simply came to mind.

“Today you’re not with Lina?”

However, his younger sister’s answer was outside of Tatsuya’s expectations.

“Today, she is absent, Onii-sama. She was in a hurry regarding some business related to her family and the like.”

“Hmm…?”

“Absent just after transferring in from overseas?” Tatsuya thought, but since he didn’t also know a foreign magician student other than her, he did not assert it to be abnormal. In the first place, if her identity is considered, there should be a lot of things which have priority over school. Besides, there was no way that Lina would have told Miyuki or Honoka reasons more than “House-related”. Therefore, Tatsuya did not inquire further.

Erika and Mizuki had displayed concern in her behavior, but — in fact, the difference was that Mizuki was “worried” and Erika was “curious” — more than that, even if he asked Miyuki, he understood that the answer given to them wouldn’t necessarily be the truth. Just like that, as usual, though one person was missing (the person missing being Shizuku, not Lina), the seven people crowded around the table.

“Speaking of that, is Shizuku doing well?”

Erika’s line of sight turned towards Honoka.

“Yeah, she seems to be doing well. She also said the lessons are not that difficult.”

Without even considering the question, Honoka immediately replied. Due to the present era’s communication infrastructure, the other side of the Pacific Ocean was not such a big distance.

“However, she said that she was surprised that class discussion forms including teachers still remain.”

For this episode, everyone showed facial expressions mixed with surprise and interest. Since the system of students going abroad to learn magic has virtually ceased, what kind of teaching was done in foreign countries was a kind of information that was hardly available.

“Then, maybe Lina is perplexed as well in various ways, right?”

“That really doesn’t look like it.”

Miyuki, while smiling, denied Mizuki’s concern. In fact, Lina did not appear to be perplexed at the difference of lessons structure between America and Japan. “As if from the very beginning, she has only ever attended Japanese Magic High School”, Miyuki secretly revealed a nasty smile.

It was a sexy little devil smile, fortunately no one had noticed it. Her friends’ awareness was rooted to the spot at the next bombshell announcement Honoka brought out.

“We spoke on the phone a little yesterday as well, but Shizuku was also surprised at the news of the ‘Vampire event’. Somehow, a similar incident seems to have happened in America as well, she said.”

“Eeeh! Is that true?”

“I also asked Shizuku the same thing. It seems to take place not in the West Coast where Shizuku is, but in the central area in the southern part of Dallas.”

“It’s the first time I heard of this…”

Having also recently received warnings from his aunt, Tatsuya, who diligently checked the USNA-related news, unexpectedly muttered so in an admiring tone.

“Even on the other side, it seems that they have a tolerably working information restriction. Shizuku also said that it was not from the news that she heard it, but from a well-informed student who happened to be a former exchange student.”

Possibly happy at drawing Tatsuya’s attention, Honoka had a bashfully smiling face as she explained.

In the eyes of Tatsuya who nodded, a light strong enough to be said it was just out of curiosity was dwelling.




At the time that Tatsuya’s group had been excited with the topic of their friend who was studying overseas, the blond haired and blue eyed high school student who had come to study from abroad was in a secret meeting at the USNA embassy.

“In other words, you say that in Freddy’s, no, First Lieutenant Fomalhaut’s cerebral cortex, a neuronal structure never seen in a normal human was formed?”

Though the meeting was encroaching into lunch time, no one there, including Lina, requested a break.

“It may be misleading to say normal human.”

The one who answered was a man who, though not wearing the white lab coat, had indeed the appearance of your everyday regular scientist.

“From the results of the autopsy, in Alfred Fomalhaut’s brain, a neuronal structure, which has never been observed in the cerebral cortex of a human so far, magicians included, has been identified. Specifically, a structure similar to a small corpus callosum was formed in the pre-frontal cortex.”

Seeing there being many participants revealing an ambiguous expression (of course Lina was also one of them), the scientist began to explain once again except this time with a slight lecture tone.

“You know that human brain is divided into the left hemisphere and right hemisphere, right?”

Seeing all the participants nodding, he continued.

“So, the left and right hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum located in the center of the brain. Conversely, this means that the brain of an ordinary person does not usually have a structure, which only connects the right and left hemispheres of the brain in the center part.”

“The pre-frontal cortex is the surface portion of the brain… Originally there should not be a structure which connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain there, right?”

“That’s right. In other words, it means that there is something in First Lieutenant Fomalhaut’s brain that a human should not have.”

Lina finally understood why she personally had to come here today. Certainly it’s not something that can be discussed on the phone.

“What kind of function does it perform? I’ve heard before that the pre-frontal cortex is the area closely connected to the ability of thinking and judgment, but… Can the newly formed brain cells affect the mental capability to that extent?”

“We USNA magic researchers believe that the brain is not an independent thinking organ; the real thinking core is the Pushion Information Body; the brain’s role is to receive the information sent from the so-called ‘mind’, and the communication organ transmits the information of the body to the mind. Although still in the theoretical stage, the possibility is very high.”

The scientist, with an ingratiating smile shook his head at the question of the senior officers sitting on the other side.

“If this hypothesis holds, it is conceivable that the new neuronal structure formed in First Lieutenant Fomalhaut’s brain links with unknown mental functions, which was not conventionally downloaded.”

The attendee yet again had a confused expression. Among them, Lina, who was still lost in thought, requesting to speak, raised her hand.

“Major, what is the matter?”

Although prompted by the scientist to speak, words would not come out. From her red lips, without attracting the men’s eyes, Lina spun her tale after three seconds had passed.

“…Doctor, regarding the unknown mental functions, is there a possibility of the intervention of an external magic?”

The scientist was quick to answer.

“I think what Major Sirius is trying to say is that there is a possibility that First Lieutenant Fomalhaut was being manipulated, but unfortunately, that possibility does not exist. Although there is a hypothesis, there is no doubt to assume that the mind and the body interact one-to-one. Even if one could interfere with someone else’s mind, it wouldn’t be to the extent of affecting the brain’s structure. Besides, a magic which alters the mind’s very structure does not exist.”

From the phrase “Magic which alters the mind’s very structure”, Lina remembered the legend of one magician. However, that magician was already dead. At the end of twenty years of hospitalization, without being married, and certainly without having children, that one should have left this world.

Lina slightly shook her head, thinking back to the matter at hand.




Though it is the afternoon session, the third-year students already had free attendance to school. Taking advantage of the fact that the second-year students were bound in classrooms and practice rooms, two third-year students, a man and a woman, secretly met in an empty clubroom.

However, there was no sweet atmosphere there at all. Despite the fact that both sets of parents regarded the pair as possible marriage partners. (Though one might say that each of them had more than one coupling candidate).

And of course, this secret meeting can only being described as “secret meeting” instead of “date”. Katsuto and Mayumi came to this place on behalf of the Juumonji House and the Saegusa House, respectively.

“I wonder why we have to come specifically in a place like this.”

“Sorry for that. I judged that it was the least outstanding way. As the Juumonji House, I want to avoid stimulating the Yotsuba as a result, for now.”

“There is an ongoing Cold War status between our House and the Yotsuba since last month. Geez, because that sly fox old man did something unnecessary.”

Turning towards Mayumi revealing a little grunt of disgust, Katsuto chuckles.

“Even Saegusa can speak in such a way.”

“Ara, Sorry. Was it vulgar?”

As Mayumi starting putting on a false coquettish air, Katsuto’s chuckles turned into a bitter smile.

“When I’m with you, I sometimes happen to wonder whether or not I’m treated like a man.”

“It’s a misunderstanding, you know? Juumonji-kun is, among my acquaintances, the most manly. It’s that simple.”

“Can’t it grow into a relation between a man and a woman, now?”

“Since the entrance examination, we are rivals of three years.”

After each laughed at the other in a hushed tone bout, the two people changed their expression at the same time. Since even while laughing, the heavy feeling of tension was drifting between the two people, one can’t say that the atmosphere changed.

“Juumonji-kun. I will convey the message from my father, no, the Head of the Saegusa House, Saegusa Koichi. The Saegusa House expects a united front with the Juumonji House.”

“How hasty. Not a ‘cooperation’, but suddenly a ‘united front’, huh.”

Cutting his speech, Katsuto requested an explanation with his gaze. Of course, even Mayumi intended to give an explanation so that the other party could understand the circumstances.

“How much do you know about the Vampire event?”

“I don’t know anything beyond what is reported. Our House doesn’t have as many henchmen as the Saegusa House.”

To the words that could be taken as Katsuto’s humility, Mayumi’s lips loosened a little.

“Well, matching for a thousand is the motto of the Juumonji House. Whereas in the Saegusa House, as far as I know, it’s only the number that is large.”

Mayumi suggestively cuts her words.

And, before being urged by Katsuto, continued like this.

“The victims of the Vampire event are exactly three times of what was reported. Twenty-four victims have been confirmed yesterday.”

Even if it’s Katsuto, he could not help being surprised at this.

“…Is that only in this Tokyo neighborhood?”

“The metropolitan area of Tokyo, and moreover also concentrated in the urban areas.”

Katsuto crossed his arms and was quietly thinking.

Mayumi silently waited for him to speak.

“There are victims that the Saegusa House knows that the police don’t know. Moreover, it’s in a limited narrowed area that damage has occurred (the victim is still in place, being locked into a narrow area)… Have the Saegusa officials been victims?”

“It’s half correct. The victims who the police don’t know are all our magicians and those in cooperation with us. Even the victims who are not are proven to be either magicians or those who possess the disposition to magic. For example, like the students of the Magic University.”

“In other words.”

Katsuto’s expression tinged with dreadfulness.

“That means the culprit is targeting magicians, huh.”

“…Juumonji-kun, you’re a little scary.”

But the stimulus of that expression seemed to be too strong for a high school girl. Apart from whether it was his real intention or acting.

“Hmm… Sorry.”

And even if it was an act, it had enough effect to dent Katsuto.

“We don’t know whether there are one or multiple perpetrators of those serial murders; anyway, it is safe to presume that this ‘vampire’ assumes magicians as targets.”

For some reason, by calmly returning to the topic without a follow-up to Katsuto, who started off the melancholy, the true nature of Mayumi showed she was surely a “devilkin” after all.





“In chronological order, first off the Magic University students and staff have been killed, the staff of our House investigating were killed while trying to avenge the previous loss, and meanwhile the victims had also increased, causing this kind of situation.”

“Indeed, we can’t ignore it.”

Leaving the damage received to the edge of the facial expression from Mayumi, Katsuto nodded deeply.

“Are there not any clues? If it’s someone who possesses ability to injure the Saegusa magicians, we can only consider either enhanced soldiers or magicians. And also, the possibility that it is a foreigner is high. Either someone who entered the country before and after the case outbreak, or a suspicious person among the foreigners who have gone to Tokyo?”

To Katsuto’s inquiry, Mayumi shook her head. It’s likely that the Saegusa also considered the same thing and had already investigated.

“But, speaking of foreigners who entered the country before and after the case outbreak…”

Mayumi had faltered there, but in response to Katsuto’s gaze urging her to continue, she hesitantly continued speaking.

“From the USNA, there are a lot of foreign student magicians and Magic Engineers who entered the country. There is also an exchange student in this school, who has come… Juumonji-kun, do you think she is suspicious?”

“I think she is suspicious, but she is probably not the culprit.”

Katsuto’s reply was immediate.

“I don’t think she is completely unrelated, but may we leave her for the time being?”

“If Juumonji-kun says so…”

Mayumi also did not seriously seem to doubt Lina. To Mayumi, who cast down her eyes as a loss of self-confidence, Katsuto asked something that was bothering him.

“But, if it is such a thing, I think you should cooperate with the Yotsuba.”

To the reasonable proposal of Katsuto, It was Mayumi’s turn to frown this time.

“Actually, I think so too, but… this is breaking the unwritten rule here. If Father doesn’t apologize and admit his faults, I think that the fence-mending will be impossible.”

“But your father has no intention to apologize to the Yotsuba, huh… though it is understandable given the past discord between Maya-dono and Koichi-dono… However, it is really rare for the Yotsuba to harden their attitude until now.”

In the policy of independency if portrayed positively, or the policy of self-centeredness if portrayed negatively that the Yotsuba adopted (though, the independence doesn’t originally have a bad meaning), they had always adopted the stance of not caring about what the other Houses do. Solidly progressing towards improving their own efficiency, ranked with the Saegusa in the top of the Ten Master Clans only by the virtue of their magic power, it was a Clan which can be said to be heretical even among the Ten Master Clans.

Katsuto had sometimes thought what on earth they even did behind the scenes, but even so, that they were showing a clear confrontational attitude that disrupts the clan meeting was as far he knew. Though, he could not say it to Mayumi, it was the Saegusa who substantially brought up the seeds of conflict.

Thinking that “What on earth had happened?” was probably reflected on his face.

“I don’t know the details either, but…”

Mayumi with a bitter feeling reluctantly opened her mouth.

“To a certain section of the Defense Military Intelligence under the patronage of the Yotsuba, that sly fox father seemed to have secretly meddled in. And that was discovered…”

“…I see.”

Then, the Yotsuba’s firm attitude made perfect sense. To Mayumi, who had a face likely to begin grinding her teeth at any moment, Katsuto could only reply so.

A not too short period of time had elapsed and Mayumi, who finally regained a calm expression, turned again toward Katsuto.

“So, what do you think? Would the Juumonji House collaborate with the Saegusa House?”

To Mayumi who asked once again, Katsuto nodded immediately.

“I will cooperate.”

“Although it is the usual thing… it is a really pretty straightforward answer.”

To Katsuto’s reply, with also no trace of doubt, Mayumi bustled with a shocked voice.

“I have said it before. Since I heard the story, even for the Juumonji House, it is not a situation which can be ignored.”

Of course, he would not be Katsuto if he was shaken by that.





Chapter 5




An unbroken stream of pedestrians plodded beneath the night skies of Shibuya. However, from a grandiose perspective, this was a problem restricted to Shibuya only.

Late in the night, there would be brief durations where no one was around, creating small pockets like the eye of a storm. Such as the narrow alleys between the taller buildings and skyscrapers. Like the small parks that dotted the landscape between the intersections of larger boulevards and smaller lanes. –This, was just like the confined green lands which only allowed one step at a time.

Still, even if no one was walking about, it did not mean no one was present. There were two humanoid entities in the park. One was a shadow-like figure who wore a long overcoat and scarf with a round hat covering the eyes, completely concealing any features or hints of gender. The other wore a gorgeous coat over a knitted sweater and mini skirt with a pair of thick heeled shoes and was clearly a young woman.

After covering the female corpse on the bench, the individual wearing the hat rose when a new figure appeared to their rear and struck up a conversation.

(Still incompatible?)

Long overcoat, scarf, hat. This new figure was dressed in the exact same way as the first one and inquired in a voice that did not vibrate in the air.

(Negative. The connection was lost after transferring the replica this time, but just as before, we could only absorb psions from the blood before the replica lost stability and returned.)

The first individual responded to the second in the same soundless voice. The two figures were communicating using telepathy.

(So replication remains beyond us?)

(That’s impossible. After all, we ourselves are replicas of the original.)

(Hm…… Then, even if they possess physical compatibility, they cannot become one of us without desires of their own.)

(Are there people in this world without desires?)

(You mean there are other conditions?)

(In order to determine the truth, we need more samples.)

(……That remains unchanged.)

(Just as I am myself and you are you. Nothing has changed.)

(You have a point…… Hm?)

The two figures broke off their conversation over the telepathic link and turned their faces towards the same direction.

(Someone broke through the spiritual barrier. Two…… No, three people?)

(I raised the power of the barrier specifically because I was conducting an experiment. Looks like these are particularly talented individuals.)

(There are only two of us. Shall we retreat?)

(No, this is a rare opportunity. The physical vessel of someone capable of breaking through the spiritual barrier might be compatible. Fortunately, the last member seems to have been separated from the other two. We should be able to neutralize the first two before they meet up.)

(Got it. Then are we of accord?)

Signals of consent were passed along. Leaving the corpse on the bench, the two figures disappeared into the shadows beyond the street lamps.




Tonight, Leo was again treading the streets of Shibuya. Yet, this wasn’t the usual “aimless wandering”. He had received details regarding suspicious individuals from a close friend and was hurrying along to verify the veracity of the eyewitnesses.

Even Leo himself did not know why he was so motivated in doing this sort of sleuthing.

A sense of justice? There were other more heinous crimes.

Territorial? Shibuya was not his home turf.

Curiosity? In all honesty, he didn’t really care about the real identity of the perpetrators.

At any rate, he felt that this wasn’t something he could ignore. This was probably the reason that was closest to the truth.

After searching his feelings, Leo arrived at this conclusion.

Walking at night. Moving in the darkness. Just now, he heard a broken series of noise like the sound of insects beating their wings. This wasn’t a sound in the audible spectrum, but a sound that brushed across the deepest recesses of Leo’s consciousness.

He couldn’t explain why, but Leo was unable to see this as just simple background noise. Nonetheless, Leo’s instincts told him that this was the sound of people conversing. This was someone using the magic calculation area in the depths of the consciousness to speak. Following the source of the signal, Leo gradually drew closer.




Stars was the premiere magic combat force within the USNA. –That being said, not all the American combat Magicians were directly a part of Stars. In reality, of the three Strategic-Class Magicians that were officially recognized within the USNA, only Angie Sirius was affiliated with Stars. The other two were currently split between an Alaskan base and a base in Gibraltar.

Even so, it remained an unshaken fact that the primary source of the USNA’s magical prowess in the army came from the Magicians in Stars. This was especially the case for the Magicians granted the rank of planets, as they symbolized the “strongest magical combat force in the world”. Precisely since Alfred Fomalhaut was also of planet rank, his desertion inflicted a huge blow to the high command with the USNA. In this particular desertion incidence, the USNA could not draw the line at Fomalhaut alone. They had to execute every deserter as a warning to the rest.

Currently, the two people who were rapidly progressing through the Shibuya night were also hunters dispatched from the USNA army to pursue the deserters and belonged to the unit “Stardust”. Like Stars, they too were under the direct command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but they were only the remnants of the stars that could not become stars themselves. In spite of this, these magic troopers still possessed considerable combat prowess. They had given up on being well rounded and instead honed their specific talents to the level of the Stars. That was what it meant to be Stardust. This time, the members selected to hunt the deserters specialized in pursuit. They were Magicians who had been implanted in Japan, but had previously remained as inactivated assets, and specialized in identifying psion waves and traces of magic.

Tonight, they finally found the psion trail of one of the deserters, Stars Planet-Class Specialist, Charles Sullivan, call sign “Demus Second”, and had closed to within an easy distance on foot.

“Target is in the clearing up ahead.”

One of the two came to a halt and nodded at the other’s words before removing an information terminal from the coat they wore. After calling up a map, they verified through the search function that there was only one path to the park. There was one entrance to the left of their current position as well as an entrance to the right around the corner.

“We have detected one target. Let’s strike from both sides. I’ll go right.”

Gone were the large coat and skirt, revealing a dazzling set of tights and heavy boots. The outer garb was to better mingle with the young women moving about at night while hiding their identity as American soldiers. The only typical aspect of these female Magicians was that they were speaking in normal tones.

“Understood…… Let’s get moving, we don’t have much time. Remember, strike at the same time.”

“Got it.”

The two hunters split off to the left and right.

Beneath the hat pulled low and the scarf, a gray cloth covered in a pattern of black bats obscured the face. Features completely hidden from view, the figure in the long coat walked while keeping an eye on the alley exit. A smirk tugged at the corners of the mouth covered in cloth.

(Pursuers from the military. They have sorely underestimated me if they think two Stardust members will be a match for me. )

(That’s based on who you were before.)

Receiving the cognitive signal from his vanished companion, the creature who was once Charles Sullivan turned its derisive smirk into a wry one. Ever since turning into this form, there was no way for him to hide anything from his compatriots. There was no sense of privacy at all. However, the current Charles Sullivan wasn’t displeased at this turnout. For them, this was only a natural course of events and did not constitute a source of irritation.

Once he put all his concentration into the depths between his brows, he could also detect what his comrade was thinking about. Through the new sensory organ located between the right and left hemispheres of the brain, they could easily reach consensus. He was the entity known as Charles Sullivan, but at the same time he was also a part of “them”.

(I see. Given their knowledge of my rank as a Satellite-Class, we can also predict their movements. I won’t need the backup.)

In response to the Sullivan’s cognitive signal, this time the sound of bees flapping their wings came back.

(Just in case, I’ll still make a few preparations.)

This formulated response came from his other comrade in the vicinity.

Contact between the two sides came in the next instant.

“Deserter, Demus Second. Put your hands in the air and keep them where I can see them.”

A young woman’s voice cried out in front of Sullivan. At the same time, a silent wave of noise impacted him like cutting through glass.

The real identity of this noise was the psion wave coming from Cast Jammer, a device developed by the USNA Army’s R&D Department to inhibit weaponry and equipment worn by Magicians. The inhibitory waves from the Cast Jammer were unlike the background noise that indiscriminately affected all magic like the ones seen in Cast Jamming when using Antinite. The Cast Jammer specifically targeted CAD functions. By intentionally using multiple CADs to generate additional psion waves, this directly interfered with the Activation Sequence’s processing. Generally, this type of interference could only occur when one individual’s psion waves were interfering with one another, but through the analysis of their opponent’s psion wave signatures, the USNA had successfully neutralized CADs (to a limited degree).

This wasn’t something that could be used by anyone. In order to use Cast Jammer, a high level of Non-Systematic Magic was required to release psion wave types. In addition, its effective range was less than 5 meters. Nevertheless, in terms of counter magic abilities that did not require Antinite, Cast Jammer was definitely the USNA Army’s ace in the hole in this age.

Faced with the naked barrel of a gun, Sullivan raised both hands above his head as instructed, with both hands easily visible. This order seemed rather vague to the average layman, but its intent was to deny the target the ability to use a CAD. Based on the data in the possession of the pursuers, or executioners in this case, Demus Second was incapable of using magic without a CAD and his physical abilities were that of an average soldier. Ordinarily speaking, once magic was out of the picture, he would be unable to offer much resistance against them, who were both Magicians and augmented soldiers.

“The higher ups have ordered you to be killed on sight. However, if you are to cough up information on your cohorts, a lighter sentencing would be available.”

After hearing the hunter say her piece with her finger still on the trigger, Sullivan shrugged.

“Demus Second. You have 10 seconds to decide.”

“No, there’s no need.”

She must have been bemused by the utter lack of terror or anxiety in Sullivan’s tone, because she failed to fire any bullets.

“You two should be Hunters Q and R from Stardust.”

Upon hearing Sullivan name their call signs aloud, the slightly slackened finger once again tightened.

“There’s no way you can beat me.”

At the same time Sullivan made this outrageous declaration, a gunshot rang out. Thanks to the silencer, the sound was roughly equivalent to that of an air gun. However, the bullet fired from this gun could snuff out life with little to no difficulty.

A muffled groan rang out from behind Sullivan. The fired bullet did not penetrate Sullivan’s breast that lay directly ahead, but went through Hunter R’s arm.

“Didn’t you hear? They must have told you to avoid firearms when going up against me.”

“This is Trajectory Alteration?”

Once Sullivan condescendingly said those words, Q revealed an expression of utter shock. They knew that Sullivan specialized in magic that altered the trajectory of projectiles, but they also heard that he was unable to use magic without a CAD.

“Could it be that the Cast Jammer was ineffective……?”

“Wrong.”

Sullivan didn’t even turn around as he directly rejected R’s words as she pressed a hand to her arm.

“Cast Jammer is functioning normally. Except,”

Q and R noticed through the surrounding atmosphere that Sullivan’s face under the cloth with black bats had twisted into a sneer.

“I have long since surpassed the need to use a CAD.”

Q holstered the gun beneath her skirt. The two hunters drew stilettos from their sleeves and charged at Sullivan from both the front and the rear.

A normal human being should not be able to avoid the attacks from augmented physical bodies. Yet, the supposedly normal Sullivan fluidly dodged the attacks. This wasn’t something that could be accomplished with athletic prowess. R’s blade, which was originally aimed at Sullivan’s neck, had unnaturally shifted its trajectory and slid elsewhere. As if being pulled along by the blade, Q slid before R and managed to stifle Sullivan before he began his attack.

“He can even change the trajectory of the blade that’s in my hand!? How are you able to manipulate such powerful magic?”

“I have no reason to explain to you why I am no longer who I was.”

“Silence!”

Suddenly bursting in a sprint, Q changed the direction of her downward stroke and cut a hole in Sullivan’s coat to reveal the carbon armor beneath. Immediately on her heels, R was closing in and striking at the gap between the armor with her blade.

“Ugh!”

Still, R’s blade slid across Sullivan’s chest as he turned. The blade’s trajectory once more went awry, causing R to lose her balance and let out a gasp.

As if performing a magic trick, a blade that looked just like the ones the hunters had materialized in his hand.

Sullivan immediately swung the blade downwards towards R’s back.

Yet, his blade bounced back as if it had impacted an invisible wall.

“Inertia Reversal!? And at this degree of strength!”

“Major!”

Sullivan’s line overlapped with Q’s outcry.

Sullivan immediately realized the implication behind those words and swooped directly towards R, who was still trying to recover her balance.

At this time, blades descended from the skies.

Four daggers flew towards Sullivan’s back as he leaped.

Sullivan’s body massively slid to one side.

His original leaping trajectory would have led directly to R, but he was forced to slide to the right in order to avoid the descending blades.

The moment he landed, Sullivan immediately pulled R’s body towards Q and threw the four daggers towards them.

The blades that flew towards Sullivan rebounded just before hitting the ground and blocked the daggers flying towards Q and R.

Sullivan took this opening to leap onto the walls of the skyscraper.

After kicking off three times from the skyscrapers, he reached the rooftop of the buildings that formed one of the alleys.

A Magician with flaming red hair, golden eyes, and wearing a mask planned to follow the other’s footsteps and pursue as she watched his fleeing form.

Still, taking note of the newly active psions bustling about in the alley, she abandoned the pursuit.

Correction, in order to prevent additional victims from appearing, she charged headlong into the depths of the alley.




Feeling the rapidly growing tension in the air that could mean nothing but combat, Leo’s footsteps came to a grinding halt rather than speeding up. He wasn’t lying to Toshikazu when he said he wasn’t planning on doing anything dangerous. Leo’s instincts told him the area ahead of him wasn’t somewhere he could safely tread out of curiosity alone.

He removed the information terminal from his pocket and sent a concise message to the address that Toshikazu taught him. The contents were simply “The vampire is here”. After reporting his current location, Toshikazu could immediately arrest the suspect of the serial homicides if he was on the ball. Leo planned on leaving the current area before he could be embroiled in another incident, so he turned around – to find a figure laying on one of the benches in the park.

Concern and caution warred within him before caution finally caved in the end. Instead of calling him a goody two shoes, it was more appropriate to say that he was a little deficient in the fear department. This was a weakness only the strong are born with, so suffice to say, a descendant like him also inherited that. Despite this, Leo wasn’t entirely defenseless as he carefully and exhaustively approached the young woman’s side.

“Hey, are you OK?”

Leo carefully reached out a hand to shake her by the shoulder, but the woman failed to react in any way. When he pressed a hand to the woman’s neck, Leo’s expression stiffened. The flesh was old, with no sign of a pulse. –Scratch that, while very weak, at the very least there was still something.

Leo frantically pulled out the information terminal and sent out an emergency distress call, this time directed to the ambulance instead of the police. Just as Leo was about to send out a distress call about someone being on the verge of death,

He reflexively turned his head around and raised the hand holding the terminal in front of his face.

The terminal shattered into pieces. By the time Leo was able to recover after leaping back several steps, he already knew that his opponent’s weapon was a retractable police baton.

What an odd opponent. Beneath the round hat, only the eyes could be seen since everything else was covered by a chilling white mask. The long overcoat that went all the way from the shoulders to the feet obscured any human form or hint of gender. Nay, forget gender, Leo couldn’t even tell if he was fighting a human.

In the depths of Leo’s consciousness, the sound of insects flapping their wings could be heard, just as silent as it was before. But this time, Leo felt that this was a “voice” urging its comrade to retreat.

Taking advantage of the fact that he was distracted by the noise, the masked individual had charged in front of him in a flash. Leo was aware that this was Personal Acceleration Magic, but he couldn’t detect any sign of an Activation Sequence. It was almost as if they were directly manipulating the Magic Sequence before charging forward. He didn’t even have time to call up Fortifying Magic, so Leo could only raise his left arm to block the police baton that was sweeping forward in a horizontal arc.

The next instant, a dull thud heralded something being smashed in.

Seeing the police baton bent out of shape, the masked individual visibly faltered.

“That hurt!”

Leo struck the masked man dead center on the chest, creating the sound of two hard objects impacting one another.

The odd man lurched backwards while Leo shook both his hands as if in great pain. Still, he appeared to have been spared the fate of fractured bones. The left arm that took the full brunt of the police baton also seemed to retain its full freedom of movement.

“Carbon armor beneath that coat, huh? You came well prepared.”

Leo inwardly regretted not bringing a weapon while keeping a wary eye on the masked man, falling into a combat stance in the meantime. Leo’s gut feeling told him this masked man was the “vampire”.

The stranger abandoned the police baton and extended both hands forward. On the left side, the left fist was raised to chin height while the right fist was held before the chest. This looks like Chinese martial arts, Leo thought. Still, there was one other detail worth noting. The size of those fists looked like they belonged to a woman.

The stranger struck with the wind. Personal Acceleration Magic coupled with Move-Type Magic with the wind at their back.

Leo used his jacket, already with Fortifying Magic spread throughout, to deflect the narrow blades that came with the wind.

The stranger’s hand chopped towards Leo’s left arm.

The stranger managed to grab hold of Leo’s left arm.

In the next moment, Leo suddenly felt like his strength was giving way, causing his right fist to come to a halt.

His opponent stretched the right hand towards Leo’s chest, right above the heart.

Leo exerted his strength one last time and moved his right fist again.

Just as the masked man’s hand came into contact with Leo’s chest, Leo’s fist struck a major pressure point on the man’s waist. The stranger crumpled back while Leo fell weakly to his knees.

He definitely felt his blow strike home, but Leo wasn’t sure if that constituted a fatal attack.

If he lost consciousness here, he was as good as doomed. There was no guarantee that his life wouldn’t end permanently here. Realizing this, Leo forced himself to raise his head.

The masked man had already risen. While he or she was pressing their chest, it was plain that they hadn’t lost combat effectiveness. However, for some unknown reason, this stranger wasn’t finishing Leo off or even looking at him for that matter.

Reading the atmosphere, Leo followed the masked man’s gaze to find what Leo was forced to admit was a “demon”.

Flaming red hair and golden eyes. Maybe because of the distance, the body size looked a little on the petite side, or maybe Leo was plainly losing consciousness.





Within his murky awareness, Leo thought he saw the stranger flee towards the side street, with the demon in hot pursuit.

Fully transformed into her persona as the masked Magician Sirius, Lina briefly wavered after glancing over Leo’s crumpled figure on the side of the road. Nonetheless, that only lasted a brief instant before Angie Sirius elected to pursue the stranger. Earlier, the man with the bat masks – Charles “Demus Second” Sullivan – escaped while she was busy providing cover for her allies. There was no way she could afford for this white masked individual to escape as well.

“Silvie, can you trace the psion waves?”

Lina’s question was posed to Silvie, who was still at their base. Unfortunately, the answer that came back was not the desirable one.

“I’m sorry. There’s too much background noise, so I can’t lock on.”

“How about the cameras?”

Hearing that the psion radar was unreliable, Lina immediately asked if they could use low altitude satellite imaging to continue the pursuit.

“We still have visual on the target. However, there are a lot of obstacles in the city, so it is unknown how long we can maintain visual.”

“Understood. Continue the pursuit.”

Knowing that she couldn’t rely on technological support, Lina’s pace quickened. Obviously, the late night streets were filled with the auras of young men and women, causing the stranger’s psion remnants to die out even faster. In order to keep up with the masked individual who was fleeing at superhuman speed, Lina raised the output on her own Personal Acceleration Magic.

Maybe it was because the target noticed she was closing the gap, but the target in the white mask suddenly altered their route. The stranger switched from the streets filled with people to the slopes of the residential sector. The greenery increased while signs of human life decreased.

This actually made it easier for Lina. With less people around, it was easier to differentiate the psions. While the frequency of her losing sight of her target increased, she was now getting more and more familiar with the prints of her target’s psion wave. She was almost there, Lina estimated based off her experience. She finally caught up to her target – or at least that’s how it was supposed to be, in the park.

Lina was immediately surrounded by psion noise.

(Cast Jamming!?)

The moment that thought crossed her mind, Lina quickly rejected it. Her Personal Acceleration Magic had not decreased in the slightest. Even if magic applied to oneself received a reduced effect from Cast Jamming, that was still “somewhat more uncomfortable than usual” and not complete immunity. Even for Lina – no matter how capable Sirius’s magical ability was, it was impossible to completely disregard the effects of Cast Jamming. Thus, this background noise must come from something else.

(Damn it!)

Lina immediately realized its true purpose. Rather, she personally felt it.

She was unable to pursue the white masked individual’s psion remnants. They hadn’t disappeared, she was just unable to differentiate them.

Lina finally understood why her target drew her to a place where there was less people about. Sure, it was easier for her to recognize her opponent’s psion waves, but the reverse was true as well. This background noise was a type of long distance magic. In order to create this background noise specifically for Lina, the white masked individual brought Lina into this remote location where no one was around.

(……It’s a shame, but I can’t do this alone.)

“Major, what happened?”

Likely out of concern for Lina, who had suddenly stopped her footsteps, Silvie’s voice that came over the ear set was rather perturbed.

“I lost them. Returning to base.”

Regretful, but frank, Lina admitted her failure.




Chiba Erika’s day started very early in the morning. Every dawn, her training of blood and sweat was her homework.

Until the age of 10, she had followed her father’s instructions without question.

Until the age of 14, when told of who she was, she wanted to be a Chiba swordsman more than anyone else.

Until last March, she always did this out of habit.

Yet, since last April, since she first met him, this was now her own wish.

By her own will, to become even stronger.

At dawn, she didn’t hold a sword. Accurately reading Erika’s ability, her father had diligently raised her to be the user of the Secret Arte – Yamatsunami, no, trained her for the sake of her becoming the wielder of Yamatsunami. The technique imparted to her struck like the wind and descended like lightning, a sword of agility. Hence during her training, the conditioning of her legs and the ability to run were especially important. In days of sloth where she had lost her goal, the long distance running that she had long neglected was never forgotten again once she vowed by her own will to “become stronger than today”.

This morning, Erika woke with her alarm clock and rose from bed. By temperament, Erika wasn’t a morning person. Even if her body had a physical reaction, mentally she wasn’t entirely awake yet. Even so, thanks to the tens of thousands of repetitions that had ingrained this habit into her, her feet swung off the bed.

Fighting down a yawn, her feet remained steady as she meandered over to her private bathroom. Despite calling it a private bathroom, the only facilities inside were a bathing area and a sink, but the fact that Erika had one of these in her own room was because she was the daughter of a capitalist, and not reared in just any normal family.

The head of the Chiba household was not miserly enough to treat children differently at least on a material level.

The hot water heater was left off even at the height of winter, allowing Erika to use ice cold water to wash her face and finally wake up completely. As she stood in front of her dresser and prepared to put on her sports clothes, she noticed her mailbox was lit with a notification of new messages.

It was still before dawn. By the local time, it was 5:30 in the morning. She went to bed at 2330 hours last night and there were no unread messages, meaning that this must have arrived late during the night.

Possibly out of some premonition that she couldn’t explain herself, Erika immediately opened the message.

Precisely because of its ease of use, e-mail remained in use to this day without being abandoned. Once the subject heading came to view, Erika’s brows became furrowed. After reading the entire message, Erika’s teeth audibly ground against one another as she managed to grit out.

“That idiotic brother of mine…… What the heck did he ask that moron to do……”

Violently tossing her pajamas to one side, she changed her underclothes.

From her wardrobe, Erika left her sports clothes where they were and removed a sweater and a dress.

Before school started, the bad tidings reached Tatsuya just as he was about to leave the house.

Not by the home phone, but by text to the personal terminal. Normally, these time intensive notifications were reserved for major disasters, which definitely lent an ominous anxiety to this message. Of course, this anxiety could be swiftly replaced with something else by reading the message within.

The sender for this message was Erika.

“Onii-sama, is it bad news?”

Perceptively picking up on her brother’s mood fluctuation, Miyuki watched Tatsuya with worried eyes.

Removing his sister from the seed of unease, this particular sort of thinking did not cross Tatsuya’s mind at this moment.

“I received a communique from Erika saying that Leo was attacked by a vampire and is currently hospitalized.”

“……You must be joking, right?”

The media had a dramatizing effect. For example, in regards to events that happened in neighboring cities, so long as the media had extensive – or even exaggerated – coverage, this might lead to the misconception that this was an event that did not relate to oneself or even came from a fictitious world. To compound matters further, an irregular existence such as a “vampire” committing crimes only served to deepen the lack of realism. Nonetheless–

“It’s the truth.”

No matter how sudden, there was no advantage in ignoring what happened in front of them. Only by directly confronting these events could any countermeasure be created.

“Looks like he’s receiving treatment in a police hospital in Nagano. Luckily, his life is not in danger, so we can pay him a visit after school.”

“—Yes.”

To Miyuki, Saijou Leonhart was only one of her brother’s friends. Since Tatsuya said visiting him after school would be fine, Miyuki had no reason to refuse. –Disregarding, of course, what she was thinking on the inside.




Today, Erika asked for the day off.

Since she had already notified Tatsuya, Mizuki, Mikihiko as well as the school’s administration, pretty much everyone who needed to know already knew.

However, Erika was watching Leo’s sickroom in the name of caretaking (that being said, she was sitting on the bench outside of the sickroom), so no upperclassmen would know.

Since the school was free attendance, time wasn’t an issue. Still, for the ex-Student Council President and previous Club Groups Leader to inquire about an unrelated student was not within expectations. The present Student Council President and current Club Groups Leader showing up would actually make sense.

Katsuto discreetly glanced at Erika, who was still camped at the entrance, before turning an uninterested gaze towards the door.

Mayumi wore a slightly mischievous smile as she nodded in greeting to Erika and also turned to the door.

Erika didn’t stop Mayumi from lightly knocking on the door to the sickroom.

She wasn’t here to care for Leo, she was here to watch out for him – to be precise, she wasn’t watching out for him either, she was guarding Leo against “uninvited guests” – so there was no reason to stop them.

Erika rose and departed behind them without bidding the two upperclassmen farewell.

Erika’s destination was one of the administrative rooms in the hospital.

Her older brother and his confidant were in that room.

When Erika barged into the room without knocking, Toshikazu could only awkwardly, discreetly try to avoid her gaze.

The redness on his face was barely visible. Seeing that the swelling had largely faded from her brother’s face, Erika regretted not hitting him harder when she had the chance. (She used her fist instead of her palm this time.)

Besides, it wasn’t very often that her “idiotic brother” willingly took a beating without any resistance.

Even if a little, if she could release some of the pent up resentment left over from her adolescent years, she wasn’t going to let the slightest chance slip through her fingers.

“……Um, young lady. You’re not considering any more violence, are you?”

Her dark fantasies interrupted, Erika turned her sharp gaze on Inagaki.

Overcome by her forceful manner, Inagaki’s eyes were drifting all over the room.

Despite the cold shoulder from her father, Erika had the largest number of supporters among the disciples.

She had a bright personality coupled with dazzling looks and, most importantly, she was the only wielder of the Secret Arte – Yamatsunami. In live combat, she was on record to wield Yamatsunami with ease. Rather than relying on her bloodline as the daughter of the house, she used her own technique, strength, and charisma to seize an almost idol-like stance in the Chiba Family.

In the face of her glare, many of the disciples of her house would cave.

Before all of that, Inagaki wasn’t in the same category as Erika. If tapped as a sparring partner, he would simply be a toy for her to play with. With her original outstanding ability and the meteoric rise in the past half a year, the worthy opponents for Erika in the Chiba style were probably restricted to only the current head and her two older brothers. The fact that Erika’s ability far exceeded her rank was out of consideration for her older sister who was only mundane in swordsmanship and talent, a fact that was well known among the family’s disciples.

“Brother.”

At Erika’s call, Toshikazu reluctantly turned his head to face her. Although her tone was more masculine, it fit perfectly with the undisguised displeasure Erika wore on her face.

“Right now, that guy should be receiving visits from direct descendants from the Saegusa and Juumonji Families, correct?”

You know exactly what they’re here for, don’t you? Erika’s gaze silently interrogated him.

Inagaki’s back became even straighter at Erika’s biting words and furious eyes, but Toshikazu wasn’t so easily awed by his sister.

“Last night, the woman rescued along with Saijou-kun appeared to be someone from the Saegusa Family.”

“And that’s all there is?”

“Orders from above. They said, don’t investigate any further.”

He spread his hands in an exaggerated manner and shrugged his shoulders.

Hearing the answer that she already guessed to be the case, Erika clucked her tongue.

“Setting aside Kasumiseki, Sakuradamon is still within our family’s jurisdiction, right?”

“But our division is within Kasumiseki’s jurisdiction.”

“How useless.”

Despite her furious muttering, Erika possessed a firm grip on logic and didn’t dissolve into a larger tantrum.

“Wiretapping?”

“Disabled once they entered the room.

I never thought that the Elfin Princess’s Multiscope would be so capable.”

Elfin Princess was morphed out of Mayumi’s nickname “Elfin Sniper”, and was an endearing term used by her supporters in the shooting magic competitions. Since the term elf tended to remind people of small creatures, this was a rather appropriate term of Mayumi, but also the same reason why no one used this term in her presence.

“So we’re becoming even more useless…… Then, what if we setup the devices outside the room?”

“Neutralized by the sound barrier. That’s probably Juumonji’s Phalanx.”

Hearing Inagaki’s objective answer, Erika didn’t even want to say the words “how useless”.

“Then we can at least speculate. You have a gut feeling, right.”

Under Erika’s gaze, Toshikazu could only shrug again.

“Just speculating? Looks like Saegusa is hiding the victim.”

“……Hiding the body, you mean?”

Hearing a “speculation” that far exceeded her expectations, Erika didn’t bother to hide her surprise before asking again.

Hiding the body belonged to destroying the evidence, and while it was fundamentally different from getting rid (abandoning or destroying) corpses belonging to homicides a person was responsible for, this was still breaking the law. Even if the Ten Master Clans retained privileges beyond the scope of the law, obstructing the police from investigating a large chain of serial homicides was……

Upon arriving at this point, Erika noticed the darker connotation behind this.

“In other words, this ‘vampire’ incident is related to Magicians, right?”

“Probably. Except we don’t know if it’s a victim or accomplice.”

“Victim? It would actually make sense if a Magician committed the crime so they don’t want to hand over the body and tried to dispose of it themselves. If even a Magician is the victim, why are they keeping it from the police at all?”

Hearing his sister’s combative words, Toshikazu revealed a meaningful smile.

“Yes, that is precisely the point. This case doesn’t seem so simple now, does it?”




After school.

Tatsuya led the usual party to the police hospital in Nagano to visit Leo. After getting the number of the sickroom at the receptionist’s desk, they headed for the elevator. However, it was here that someone called out their name.

“Everyone’s here now.”

“Erika, you’re still here?”

The gist of the situation was already conveyed through the morning text. Erika’s oldest brother was responsible for the vampire case, Leo was asked to assist in the investigation, but was unfortunately dragged into the mess. To make him shoulder the responsibility (but not take the responsibility), Erika asked for the day off to visit Leo at the hospital. At least, that’s what the text message said.

Yet, they received the communique before school and now it was almost dusk. Tatsuya using the word “still” was probably quite appropriate.

“It’s not like I’ve been here all day. I returned home once today and came back about an hour ago. I guessed that Tatsuya-kun would bring everyone at about this time.”

As they got into the elevator as a group, Erika answered Tatsuya’s question.

Her voice and expression were not unnatural in the way that someone was lying.

Except, the fact that she was perfectly normal only served to deepen the idea everything was false. On this point, Erika was probably the only one who didn’t notice.



“Erika-chan, is Leo-kun going to be OK……?”

Mizuki was standing right next to Erika in the elevator as she quietly asked her question. Even though they were just about to find out with their own eyes, she was probably still uneasy. These emotions differed from one person to another, so some people were able to keep a tighter rein on being objective.

“Don’t worry, Mizuki. Didn’t I mention in the text message? His life’s not in danger.”

Nonetheless, this also depended on compatibility between people’s differences. Seeing Mizuki heave a sigh of relief and pat herself on the chest, Erika cast a warm gaze at her, but if it was a guy doing this, Erika would undoubtedly be snarking mercilessly.

Even if no one else said it, Mizuki was definitely not the only one thinking the same thoughts. After a few more moments of awkward silence, Erika knocked on the door leading to the sickroom.

“Ah, come in.”

A young woman’s voice came from within the room.

“Kaya-san, excuse us.”

Leaving her bemused friends behind, Erika opened the door and quickly stepped in. At this time, the first one to recover was, of course, Tatsuya.

Before the curtain in the room could obscure Erika, he entered the sickroom.

Miyuki was right behind him. Seeing this, Honoka quickly hurried in as well, with Mizuki and Mikihiko coming in after exchanging a glance and closing the door behind them.

Inside the spacious and undoubtedly high class sickroom, the ones who greeted them were Leo, who was sitting up on his bed with a bored look on his face, and a young woman with ash blonde hair sitting on a nearby folding chair.

She was probably 4-5 years older than they were. Her hair was the same color as the owner of Eine Brise, which gave the impression that they shared the same nationality. In regards to her features, if they were a little craggy and accounting for the gender differences, she would look exactly like Leo, which clearly hinted at her blood relation to Leo.

“This is Saijou Kaya-san, Leo’s older sister.”

Before the question could be asked, Erika introduced them to the young woman. Her identity was just as Tatsuya and company had surmised.

Kaya rose and respectfully nodded to Tatsuya’s group in greeting. While not particularly graceful or well-rehearsed, it was still a degree of solemnness that students were unable to emulate.

After everyone inquired as to Leo’s health, Kaya took the flower vase and left the room. While she excused herself to change the water, the unstated reason was because she wanted to give them some privacy.

“What a gentle older sister.”

Mizuki murmured once Kaya disappeared through the doorway. These were her true feelings, not just some social rhetoric.

Tatsuya shared similar feelings, and no one seemed to visibly disagree.

Still, Leo revealed a slightly conflicted expression, reminding everyone that every family had its dirty laundry.

“Man, this sucks.”

Hence Tatsuya didn’t inquire any further. After all, Leo’s family situation had nothing to do with Tatsuya.

“I can’t believe you guys are seeing me in such a state.”

Leo said in embarrassment. There was no longer any trace of conflict on his features.

“Now that I look at you, you don’t seem injured.”

“I’m not that much of a pushover. It’s not like I wasn’t resisting.”

“Where were you hit?”

At Leo’s fearless grin, Tatsuya brought up the obvious question.

With that, Leo’s smile vanished.

“That’s where I don’t understand……”

That being said, this wasn’t because he was getting moody. His expression declared that he hadn’t given up, but he was honestly uncertain what happened.

“At the moment of contact, I suddenly felt like I lost all my strength. I mustered my will to deliver one last attack, to which the perpetrator fled, while I was keeled over on the ground until Erika’s older brother found me.”

“Were you poisoned?”

“Well, no matter where they looked, there’s no sign of laceration or puncture on my body. Nor is there any foreign elements in my blood.”

Truly, a particularly weird situation. Tatsuya also tilted his head while Mikihiko chimed in.

“Did you see their features?”

“Well, I did see something. They wore a hat, long overcoat with carbon armor underneath, and a mask. There was no way to tell facial features or physique, but……”

“But?”

“I got the feeling that it was a woman.”

“……A woman has the wrist strength to go toe-to-toe with Leo?”

“That’s hardly unheard of.”

Erika immediately retorted at the wide-eyed Mikihiko.

“With the right medication, even an elementary girl can strangle an adult male.”

“That’s true…… But.”

“But?”

“There’s also the possibility that you weren’t up against a human being in the first place.”

“Eh? Miki…… Are you telling me you buy into that stuff like vampires?”

Hearing Mikihiko’s low muttering, Erika immediately shot back with her eyes bulging out.

“My name is Mikihiko.”

His tone remained light, but he still stuck to rejecting that nickname. Mikihiko seemed to have that automatic response prepared. On the other hand, Erika’s response wasn’t her fault either. The subject was interesting in casual conversation, but people who actually believed in vampires, even among Magicians, were in the extreme minority.

“Do you have any ideas?”

However, Tatsuya’s reaction did not belong to either the majority or the minority. Tatsuya didn’t believe in demons and ghosts either, but nor did he rule out the possibility of an inhuman creature.

At Tatsuya’s question, Mikihiko hesitated briefly before confidently addressing the question.

“I think there’s a chance that Leo ran into a ‘Parasite’.”

“Parasite? You don’t mean literally, right?”

Seeing Erika tilt her head in one direction, she didn’t seem to think Mikihiko’s words were ridiculous. This time was likely out of genuine curiosity. His mood likely buoyed by such a sight, Mikihiko lectured on.

“Paranormal Parasites, aka Parasite. In the modern age where the existence and might of magic have been publicized, modern magic is not the only area seeking international cooperation. Ancient Magic can’t remain stagnant either, so globalization is unavoidable. Heirs of Ancient Magic have hosted many international conferences centered in England, aiming to standardize terms and concepts and refine them.”

“I know that Ancient Magic is more progressive on the international cooperation side. What of it?”

Mikihiko was starting to pick up steam when Tatsuya cut him short, causing Mikihiko to cough and rally himself.

“Parasite is also one of the acknowledged terms. Monsters, evil spirits, djinns, demons, of all the various entities in the different countries, we call the magical beings that infest human beings and turn them into inhuman creatures as parasites. Even if Ancient Magic has become globalized, that still doesn’t change the fact that they keep their secrets to themselves, so it’s not surprising that everyone here with a modern magic background doesn’t know about it.”

“I can’t believe the monsters and djinns actually exist……”

After listening to Mikihiko’s explanation, Honoka murmured in fear.

Tatsuya dropped a hand onto her shoulder.

“In the past, no one believed that magic existed. However, we are capable of using magic. Even if we were ignorant of their existence, there’s no reason to be afraid.”

This was not a natural reaction on Tatsuya’s part. He knew these words coming from him would have a profound reaction on Honoka.

Which is why Tatsuya retracted his hand after Honoka jumped at the human contact and he was sure that he dispelled that blind sense of unease. Of course, he was also aware of how Honoka lamented the lost opportunity, but he pretended to be oblivious.

“So that’s the vampire’s true identity.”

Afterwards, he glanced at Mikihiko. Being overly fearful served no purpose, but he was also well aware that ignorance could compound the threat.

Without directly replying to Tatsuya’s question, Mikihiko turned a determined look at Leo.

“Leo.”

“Um, what?”

Leo was overwhelmed by the ardor in those eyes.

“Can I examine your spectral form?”

“Spectral form?”

It appeared that the term spectral form didn’t register, seeing as how Leo could only parrot back the pronunciation. On some level, this wasn’t Leo’s fault, since it was due to neither “spiritual form” nor “soul vessel” being terms used in modern magic, rather than Leo being too slow to pick them up.

“Spectral form refers to the information body that is shaped like the physical body, except that it links the physical flesh with your spirit.”

Mikihiko used his fingertips to trace a large “spectral form”.

“The key to the spectral form is life, or life force. Monsters that devour the flesh and blood of man are rumored to prey on the life force that is taken with the flesh.”

“In other words, while vampires suck blood, what they’re really looking to do is sucking away the life force?”

Mikihiko nodded with a tight expression at Erika’s words.

“Vampires drink blood and ghouls consume flesh, but since they weren’t material beings in the first place, they should only be interested in life force. At least, if what the elders in Ancient Magic told me is to be believed.”

“Based on that line of reasoning, it shouldn’t be surprising to run into a vampire who relies on sucking out the life force, huh.”

Tatsuya murmured at Mikihiko’s words.

In response, Mikihiko nodded once more.

“If I can examine Leo’s spectral form, I think I should be able to find out. ……Honestly speaking, I was never convinced that this vampire incident was caused by normal human beings. It always seemed like something more than just serial homicides, and not just because there was no trace of blood being sucked out. My instincts as an Ancient Magic user tell me this, except I have no proof. Precisely because it was only my gut feeling, I never told everyone about Parasites. However, now even Leo has been attacked.”

“Go ahead Mikihiko.”

Leo overrode Mikihiko’s self-incriminating words. Mikihiko took a long second to process the meaning behind this concise phrase.

“……Are you sure?”

“Yeah. Actually, it’s more like I’m requesting you do so. There’s no way to respond if we don’t understand the cause.”

Leo’s underlying meaning also contained forgiveness. In response to this degree of trust, Mikihiko’s expression tightened once more as he reached his hand towards the bag next to his feet.



Wielding bona fide talismans created with black ink on paper, Mikihiko used traditional mediums that even Tatsuya came across for the first time to verify Leo’s status, and failed to disguise his shock. More likely, he never even thought of doing so in the first place.

“How should I say this…… While Tatsuya is also in a league of his own, Leo, are you really human……?”

“Hey, how polite of you.”

It was another thing altogether as a joke, but when faced with those words spoken in dead earnest, even Leo wasn’t able to laugh it off.

Leo’s mood was plainly affected.

However, Mikihiko was already astounded enough to miss this completely, or more like he wasn’t even able to detect this.

“No, but…… How are you still up and about? The average Magician would be unconscious if so much life force was devoured.”

“Setting aside exactly what life force is, can you also detect how much is missing?”

Tatsuya’s expression showed how impressed he was, to which Mikihiko replied back with a neutral smile and a nod.

“That’s because the spectral form and the physical body possess the same shape.

Since the capacity size is a given, the original amount of life force compared to the current level is more or less detectable.”

Mikihiko squinted his eyes and once again gave a measuring look at Leo.

“Currently at Leo’s life force level, forget even crawling, the average person wouldn’t even be able to remain conscious. To be able to sit up and still converse like this, his physical capability must be astounding.”

For Mikihiko, this was something that just popped out.

However, the phrase “astounding physical capability” struck Leo in the heart because of his genetic modifications to raise physical prowess.

“Probably. My body is specially designed.”

Even so, Leo kept up his smile. He didn’t plan on causing a fuss at someone who unknowingly caused him harm.

“At any rate, right now I feel powerless because that masked woman ate my life force. Is that how it goes?”

Leo suppressed the fluctuations in his heart and asked.

“I think so, but……”

“But?”

“……Since this was during combat and they have the ability to consume life force on contact, there should be no reason to suck blood. While I have no idea how they can take blood without leaving any wounds but…… Why is this Parasite wasting additional time and energy doing something extraneous like sucking blood?”

Even Tatsuya had no answer to Mikihiko’s query. In truth, this was because blood was lost instead of being sucked away, so right now they had no way of arriving at the truth.



Visiting hours came to a close and five people left the sickroom.

The five people were Tatsuya, Miyuki, Mikihiko, Honoka, and Mizuki.

Erika said she had to meet up with her brother Toshikazu and stayed behind.

Although none of the five understood those words at their literal meaning, again, none of them verbalized this.

“Speaking of which – Mikihiko.”

“Hm?”

Suddenly being called on, Mikihiko turned from his conversation with Mizuki and switched over to Tatsuya.

Miyuki and Honoka flanked Tatsuya.

While they weren’t holding onto his arms, the physical distance was close enough to make no difference.

Let all the popular men burn. Except there was no way of knowing whether Mikihiko was truly thinking this.

No matter what Mikihiko thought, it was unlikely that Tatsuya would pay heed to it.

“There was one detail I forgot to ask.”

Actually, he intentionally failed to ask this question out of concern for listening devices. Even for someone other than Mikihiko, getting Tatsuya to cough up dangerous information was extremely difficult.

“What is it?”

“In regards to creatures like demons and Parasites, do they occur frequently?”

Even though they weren’t eating, Mikihiko almost gagged.

Owing to Tatsuya’s nonchalant tone, Mikihiko listened in with only a casual mood, only to hear a rather profound question.

“……No, they are really rare. While in the stories they exist in hiding ready to do evil, those are largely Magicians pretending to be dark creatures. For example, our side believes they have determined the true identity of the infamous spirit at Mt. Oyama to be a practitioner from the Middle East.”

Unconsciously, Mikihiko was stroking his chin just like someone in a “contemplating posture”.

“The chances of a Magician running into a real spirit is about…… Maybe one in ten generations. Even so, those encounters are usually something accidentally stumbling into our world. Real incidents of spirits harming humans that necessitated immediate extermination from Magicians probably occur only once every several hundred years across the globe.

At the end of the day, the last time on record that Japan exterminated a true spirit was probably when Yusanari Abe exorcised the nine-tailed fox nine hundred years ago.”

“Yet, this vampire incident was probably done by a ‘real spirit’.”

“I believe so.”

“Do you think this is a coincidence?”

“While I cannot say for certain, but the probability is near zero……”

Mikihiko’s reply was extremely prudent.

“As history has progressed into the modern age, incidents of spirit activity have been on the decline. I am unwilling to believe that this incident came out of nowhere.”

After hearing Mikihiko’s response, Tatsuya softly said “Indeed.”



After making sure that Tatsuya’s group left and Kaya returned to the room, Leo collapsed back onto the bed in exhaustion. Although Erika was still in the room, he had already pushed himself to the limit.

“……Meh, I already know everything anyways.

There’s no need to keep bluffing any longer, OK? You’ve already worked really hard.”

“……I’ll just…… Take that as an honest…… Compliment.”

“It was an honest one. Compliment, I mean.”

Seeing Leo painfully close his eyes, Erika revealed a warm smile.

“Um, Erika-san…… Is my brother really going to be fine?”

Still, seeing this interaction, Kaya didn’t seem to find anything funny.

“No worries. I’ve already called the best doctor the Chiba Family knows of. I know it can be a little difficult for you to understand since you’re not a Magician, but life force exhaustion requires more time to recuperate than physical exhaustion. All of the necessary recovery procedures have been done already. Afterwards, the best medicine would be plenty of bed rest, so he’ll be fine after a while.”

Kaya shook slightly at being identified as a mundane. Though Erika noticed this, she didn’t espouse any comforting words from her mouth.

“Then, I’m headed off to my brother’s place. If you need anything, please don’t hold back and call the nurses, my brother’s subordinates, or even myself.”

Erika gave a cursory bow to Kaya and excused herself from the sickroom.

Leo had no intention of chiding Erika for her attitude.



“Young mistress, can you show a little mercy?”

The moment she entered the room that was listening in on Leo’s sickroom, Inagaki called out to Erika.

Although his words were vague due to several omitted words, Erika knew exactly what he was talking about. That being said, Erika also held those words in contempt.

“I don’t plan on requesting any Magician to take care of him. It doesn’t matter if it’s our parents or siblings, they’re all a hassle to deal with. I think keeping this degree of relationship here would be enough. Speaking of which…… You heard what was said in there.”

The last sentence was directed towards Toshikazu.

Erika’s oldest brother was sitting with his back to a chair and both hands clasped behind his head before he brusquely peeled off his ear set and straightened up.

“It was very interesting. Then, assuming the second son of the Yoshida Family is spot on with his theory, Erika, what do you plan on doing?”

“Under these circumstances, it doesn’t matter if he’s correct.”

How tedious, Erika’s condescending gaze seemed to accuse Toshikazu as he sat on the chair.

“Even for a moment, that guy counts as a member of the Chiba style and is one of our own. In addition, I personally instructed him in the art of the sword, so he technically counts as my first disciple. No master could just stand by while their disciple took a beating.”

“What a cold line of reasoning.”

“There’s nothing there, so stop fishing. Even if they don’t exist, there’s plenty of reason to accept the fight. I have no idea whether the vampire is male or female, they were the one who gave the offense. All we have to do on this side is accept.”

Even her brother Toshikazu had no idea if she was being truthful or prevaricating.

The only thing for sure was that Erika was dead serious, that’s all.




At the same time that Tatsuya was visiting Leo, Lina arrived at the Tokyo branch for Maximilian Devices. This was where Michaela Honda was working under the alias Mia Honda, and also one of the secret meeting grounds for the unit hunting for the deserters.

Even if not to the degree of magic university students, it wasn’t particularly rare to see magic high school students visit CAD manufacturing sites. A letter of introduction from the embassy and First High’s uniform enabled Lina to pass through all security and enter a conference room, where she met the two Stardust members she rescued last night in the nick of time, who were dressed in tight skirts and tunics.

“Major, thank you for the help last night.”

“At ease.”

Lina gestured for the two saluting members to sit before she also took a seat on the sofa. After closing her eyes and breathing deeply out, a pair of golden eyes opened beneath flaming red hair.

A completely different color than Angelina Kudou Shields, and a completely different face.

Still, neither of the two Stardust members betrayed any surprise on their faces. This golden eyed young girl with a cold face was their Angie Sirius.

“You two, what is the extent of your injuries from last night?”

“Mostly healed. It will not affect our mission.”

Hearing the hunters refer to themselves as mere tools, Lina, no, Angie Sirius wrinkled her brows, but that only served to deepen the cruel impression on her cold features rather than betraying her displeasure.

“Is that right. Then give me your sit rep.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Lina herself felt that those words didn’t convey the complete picture, but it looks like the other side got the hint.

“After picking up the trail on Demus Second, we utilized Cast Jammer based on the target’s profile. However, Cast Jammer failed to have any effect on Demus Second.”

“Did he affect Cast Jammer’s operation?”

“Negative, Cast Jammer was functioning normally. Based on Demus Second’s words, he no longer requires a CAD.”

“No longer requires a CAD…… Does that mean Sgt. Sullivan has achieved spiritualization?”

“I concur.”

In response to Lina’s suspicion, the hunters replied in the affirmative.

“The current Demus Second did not need a CAD to use Trajectory Alteration.”

“So no other magic was used.”

“Affirmative.”

“In addition, Demus Second possesses superior physical capabilities compared to our augmented bodies.”

That the deserter’s physical prowess had increased was fresh intelligence. Lina slightly turned this over in her head before carefully asking the two of them the next question.

“Has Sgt. Sullivan’s psion wave signature changed?”

“At least, we’re still able to identify it.”

“During my pursuit of Sgt. Sullivan, I suspect he made contact with his comrades. However, I was unable to observe that person’s psion wave signature.”

“……My apologies. We detected no other psion wave signature save for the Major and Demus Second.”

Lina closed her eyes and considered this for a moment.

“……Looks like our old data is no longer reliable. From today onward, continue surveillance on any deserters that you found the trail for and do not engage. Wait for me to arrive before engaging.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Returning the salute of the two Stardust members who had risen to their feet, Lina exited the conference room.



In the halls of the Tokyo branch for Maximilian Devices, Silvia was waiting for Lina.

“High Commander, this way.”

Hearing this, the red-haired, golden-eyed Lina followed Silvia. Their destination was the women’s changing room for the employees.

“This way, Major. I’ve already ascertained the premises are empty.”

Following Silvia after she unlocked the door, Lina swiftly glanced around the changing room and only let out a sigh of relief after hearing the lock on the door click home.

Her hair and irises changed color.

The red hair turned blonde and the golden eyes returned to their azure hue.

“As expected, this way is much easier. Compared to keeping ‘Parade’ up, hiding the ability to use magic is much harder.”

“Major, there’s no time. Please change before the employees return.”

Silvia immediately started nagging the relaxed Lina.

Lina shrugged her neck and started speaking to Silvia as she was changing.

“Looks like the pursuit unit couldn’t identify the psion wave signature of the person in the white mask either.”

“Really…… Looks like there are massive individual power level differences between the deserters.”

Maybe it was because she already had a premonition of what Lina was going to say, but Silvia’s voice wasn’t very amazed. Still, a dismayed aura hung around her shoulders.

“Speaking of which, why are they attacking the Japanese?”

Dressed in her underwear, Lina asked Silvia as she reached for her First High uniform.

“What do you mean by why?”

Unable to ascertain the intent of the question, Silvia returned a confused question.

“They are currently being pursued. Normally, wouldn’t they try to hide their presence as much as possible?”

“Ah, so that’s what you mean.”

At this point, Silvia finally understood what threw Lina for a loop. What Lina really wanted to ask was why the deserters were running the risk of revealing their location in order to attack Japanese people.

“I don’t know either, except……”

“Except what?”

After changing her stockings for a pair of underpants and in the middle of putting on her gown, Lina urged her to keep speaking.

“I just feel that there is a connection between this and the new power they have been granted.”

“New power…… You mean the vampire’s ability to remove blood without leaving any wounds?”

With the outer jacket and gown in place, Lina kept up her questions while fussing over her hair.

“While I’m not sure if we should call them vampires, but…… Lina, what are you doing?”

Just as Silvia was trying to organize her thoughts, her gaze once again drifted over to Lina.

Only to find the beautiful young woman with blond hair using both hands to lightly lift the two sides of her inner gown before the mirror as she struck a few poses.

“Eh, no, this is……”

Seeing her superior officer quickly recover her posture and drop her head while blushing the entire way, Silvia could only heave a deep sigh.





Chapter 6




The swung fist impacted another one.

The physical positions switched in an instant, with offense and defense seamlessly switching between one another.

Tatsuya and Yakumo were engaged in their daily morning bout.

They weren’t just taking turns battering one another.

Besides direct attacks, there were also left and right hooks that came from above and below, karate chops and palm strikes. Avoiding the attack, seizing the opponent’s extended limb, all while fending off the opponent’s other limb that was seeking to dislodge the counterattack at the last possible second.

In terms of martial arts right now, Tatsuya and Yakumo were equals.

Both of them extended their right arms.

With both attacks simultaneously missing one another, the two of them were now in a position where their backs were to one another.

Tatsuya shifted his center of gravity and raised the leg he was originally putting all of his weight on and took a step forward.

The expected elbow strike failed to arrive.

He turned.

Just like Tatsuya, Yakumo had pulled back to a safe distance.

Seeing that they both used the same sort of attack, executed the same evasive maneuver and ultimately created an unnecessary gap between the two of them, the obligatory wry smile – There was no time for any of that.

Tatsuya stepped towards Yakumo.

In terms of techniques, the two of them were neck to neck.

Tatsuya also held the edge in terms of physical prowess.

Strategy was where he fell far behind Yakumo.

In summation, the only path to victory lay in a continuous stream of attacks from Tatsuya to avoid giving his opponent any opportunity to devise any stratagems. Any situation that created unnecessary separation between the two left Tatsuya in an unavoidably inferior position. As soon as he stepped into the gulf and was prepared to swing his fist forward, Tatsuya felt that Yakumo’s presence was wavering.

Tatsuya had suffered quite a bit recently at the hands of this technique. He forcibly suppressed his frustration and activated Gram Demolition.

Yakumo’s wavering body quivered briefly before disappearing. Tatsuya’s Gram Demolition managed to nullify Yakumo’s ability.

Tatsuya fully extended his five senses and sought the location of Yakumo’s actual physical body.

Right? Or was it the left?

Even someone as strong as Yakumo shouldn’t have the time to sneak all the way behind him.

Tatsuya’s analysis was perfect.

But Tatsuya’s hypothesis was flawed.

Yakumo was standing right in front of him.

He was thirty yards behind the place Tatsuya aimed at.

It only took an instant to land the decisive blow.

The forestalled fist once again flew out.

Normally, this was an unreachable distance, but Yakumo had also taken into consideration that the moment the blow landed, there was still the possibility of mutual defeat.

Except, Yakumo’s body was not advancing with his fist.

Completely blindsided by the fist that was displaced from the body, Tatsuya’s body was flung into the air by Yakumo’s throw.



“Whew, scary, scary.”

Yakumo finally released Tatsuya’s joint after throwing Tatsuya to the ground while espousing words that didn’t sound like he had been holding back.

Since his wrist had been captured, Tatsuya was unable to execute a perfect landing. While he managed to dull the impact and prevent any fractures, he still took the blow and needed to cough a few times in order to restore his breathing to normal.

“…Master, that was?”

Hearing the words Tatsuya spoke after finally getting to his feet, Yakumo rubbed his temple with one hand as he replied back. –Probably because he was wiping away the sweat.

“Hm, I didn’t think you would be able to break through Mirage Cloak.”

While his tone remained as though he were joking, his astonishment was dead serious. His feint with the after image wasn’t something that was planned ahead of time and was a spontaneous creation. That was because Yakumo never imaged that Tatsuya could break through Mirage Cloak.

“So that technique is called Mirage Cloak, eh…Master, that’s no ordinary illusion technique, is it?”

“So you did see it.”

Although Yakumo was sighing in an exaggerated manner, he failed to hide the fact that he was highly pleased. –Most likely, he never planned on hiding it in the first place.

“Your ability to read an opponent’s technique may be a threat to your enemies, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a way to take advantage of this.”

“Like your earlier illusion?”

“Mirage cloak was a technique originally designed to shield against eyes that are not of this world.

As for its design… Well, you go ahead and ponder on your own. If it’s you, you should be able to grasp it in an instant.”

Tatsuya didn’t tell Yakumo to stop beating around the bush. Part of the reason was because asking about the techniques of others was forbidden, but what drew his attention even more was Yakumo’s choice of words.

“Master.”

“Hm? What’s with this serious expression all of a sudden… Well, you’re always like that, but now you’ve got that scary voice too.”

There was a fine line between praise and mockery when it came to that line about always wearing a serious expression, which Tatsuya finally chose to ignore because he was unable to decipher which one it was – which meant he did nothing whatsoever.

Somehow, Yakumo’s expression seemed less than pleased, which probably denoted that he made the right decision. Furthermore, Tatsuya wasn’t in the mood to play along with his jokes.

“Earlier, you spoke of things that were out of this world.”

“Ah, so that’s what this is about.”

There was no need to complete the half-finished sentence.

His reply left no room for misinterpretation, as if he had predicted that Tatsuya would ask this question.

“Our enemies are not restricted to just humans. It isn’t that rare for some of them to strike a bargain with forces beyond this world.”

While this was the expected answer based on their earlier conversation, this response ran counter to the knowledge he already had.

“However, one of my friends who is an Ancient Magic user claims that encounters with actual spirits are rare occurrences…”

Tatsuya wasn’t saying this because he believed one person over the other, but because he wanted an answer that he could believe.

“I recall that Tatsuya-kun’s friend is the second son of the Yoshida Family. While his words are also true…in your case, I believe you didn’t consider the matter thoroughly enough.”

Yakumo temporarily halted speaking there. After receiving the request to think things a little more thoroughly, Tatsuya immersed himself into a sea of considerations and arrived at a solution after a short period of time.

“Mikihiko’s words are correct, but at the same time, imperfect. Is this what you’re referring to? Actual run-ins with bona fide spirits are extremely rare, but incursions because someone else provided the impetus are not that infrequent, am I right?”

“I’ll give you the minimum passing grade.”

As befitting his words, Yakumo’s expression was far from satisfied.

“Hm…I guess even a sage like Tatsuya-kun would fall prey to association bias and cognitive traps.”

Apparently, the bar was set quite high and the scoring much more ruthless.

Even so, Tatsuya felt that it was too shameful (and not embarrassing) to be called a “sage” to the face and prayed that this would not be repeated.

It was a testament to how unruffled Tatsuya was when being praised in spite of his mistake.

Still, Tatsuya’s poise was brushed aside by Yakumo’s following words.

“You too should have had a brush or two against creatures that do not exist in this plane. In regards to what you modern magic practitioners refer to as SB Magic, what do you think they use as a medium?”

A small “Ah” escaped Tatsuya’s lips.

“I see you connected the dots. What modern magicians refer to as Spiritual Beings are legitimately ‘creatures from another world’.”

This was indeed a blind spot. Tatsuya focused on Yakumo as he continued to explain.

“Ah, conscious thought and self-awareness are both secondary. Bacteria does not have consciousness or self-awareness, but it is able to enter the human body and affect the operations of the human body enough to impact health. In addition, they even have the incomplete ability to self-replicate. However, even if they don’t fulfill the requirements of a ‘living creature’ at the intellectual level, that’s not enough to deny that they are ‘living creatures’ with the ability to infect the human body.”

“You are saying that Spiritual Beings – nothing more than isolated spirit bodies removed from physical phenomena also qualify as ‘creatures not of this world’?”

“Strictly speaking, they are more like creatures who do not possess a physical body. In addition, has anyone proven that spirits do not possess thought of their own?”

“…It is true that no one has done that. On the other hand, I know of one person who might.”

Furthermore, Tatsuya had personally beheld that friend of his manipulating spirits right in front of him. In comparison to receiving orders and having the spirit decide on their own, it made more sense that the entire process was incorporated inside the Magic Sequence and the spirit possessed consciousness of its own.

“Master, may I ask another question?

“Go ahead.”

“Modern magic believes that a Spiritual Being is an information body isolated within the information dimension from its natural phenomena. Since it originated from natural phenomena, it is possible to use Magic Sequences to recreate the original effect. This is the current theory behind Spiritual Magic.”

“Pretty much. Modern magic is truly impressive if it’s capable of coming up with this kind of theory.”

“Then, for the parasites that latch onto the spectral forms of human beings and cause mutations, where do their information bodies come from?”

After hearing Mikihiko’s words, Tatsuya suspected that Parasites were information bodies that could affect the human Eidos. Yakumo’s allusion to bacteria and diseases only served to deepen that impression.

“Parasites…what an English way of putting it. Alas, I am unaware of where these information bodies originate. Given that they are able to affect human spirit, I would imagine they came from a similar origin.”

“Information bodies from the human spirit…”

“I believe, regardless of whether the monster comes in humanoid or beast form, the only thing that can cause the living creatures of this world to alter in such a fashion must come from demons originating from spirit information bodies. Afterwards, just as how the physical manifestation of these spirits have one step in our world and the alternate shadow of this world, demons originating from the spirit also straddle the mental landscape and the aether. The reason that spiritual encounters are infrequent is not because they don’t exist, but because we are not equipped with the ability to observe the human spirit. While this line of thinking would definitely be heresy in the eyes of London, these are my true feelings on the matter.”

As expected of a major authority on Ancient Magic, that name wasn’t just for show.

It had been a long time since Tatsuya thought that way.




Two days later, Leo was still confined to bed. The average person would already be in a critical state of unconsciousness, so not being able to check out of the hospital for three to four days was considered normal. On the other hand, people would be more worried that he was pushing himself too hard or being reckless if he was actually able to leave the hospital so quickly.

At least, that’s what Tatsuya thought.

However, on some level, it was only natural that there were people who didn’t think that way.

“Leo-kun, how is he feeling…?”

Mizuki was precisely the type who didn’t think that way.

“He should be alright. They said that there were no signs of external injuries besides some bruises, and there’s no sign of fractures or internal pain. Unless you believe that Erika is lying?”

As a side note, Tatsuya actually suspected that the currently absent Erika was being less than truthful.

“That’s not what I meant…”

Still, based on Mizuki’s temperament, even if she harbored such a thought, there was no way she would be able to accuse her friend of lying.

Even if the person in question was not present, scratch that, it was precisely because the person in question was not present that she avoided talking behind their backs.

Also, the reason that Erika wasn’t in this place – the classroom before class begins, was not because she was watching over Leo at the hospital, but merely because she hadn’t arrived at school yet.

Yesterday, she also rushed in just before the bell rang.

Today was probably going to be a similar case.

“Now that you mention it, Mikihiko isn’t here yet either.”

This comment was not made with any prior considerations in mind. This was only because while he was ruminating over why Erika hadn’t arrived yet, he just remembered that Mikihiko was still absent.

At those words, Mizuki’s face turned a little stiff.

Tatsuya quickly reined in his facial muscles that were on the verge of relaxing into a grin and debated over whether to say something or remain stoic. He truly believed that what Mizuki was worrying about could not possibly come to pass, but he was unable to judge if this was a good time to broach the subject.

“Good morning~.”

“Good morning, Tatsuya, Shibata-san…”

Just as Tatsuya was bewildered over which action to take, Mikihiko and Erika entered the classroom wearing equally exhausted expressions.

Just as the two of them sat down, the display monitor flashed the signal that class had started.



During lunch break that day, Tatsuya and his group behaved a little differently than normal. Instead of going to the cafeteria, Erika was slumped over her desk. If one paid careful heed, small snores could be heard emanating from her.

There was no way to take a nap during class because they were logged on to their terminals, but now she was fast asleep.

Mikihiko said “his head was buzzing” and immediately left for the infirmary after finishing lunch. It appeared that his headache, and not murky state of consciousness, was also brought on by overexhaustion.

Since he expected this to be simple exhaustion, he left everything regarding Mikihiko to Mizuki.

Then, as for Tatsuya himself,

“Shizuku, sorry for calling you so suddenly.”

“Hm, what’s up?”

“Well, Tatsuya-kun said he had something he absolutely had to ask Shizuku.”

He asked Honoka to ring up Shizuku by phone.

“My apologies for calling you at such a late hour. I wanted to send an e-mail, but I felt that this definitely needed to be communicated directly.”

Even smaller handheld devices in modern communication systems could depict images that were almost like face to face conversations. The image that came through his personal handheld device was Shizuku, who was also using a similar device to communicate. While it has only been a short month since they last saw one another, she seemed to have visibly matured a little bit.

“No worries. It’s only 8pm over here.”

The young girl on screen squinted her eyes as she smiled. As usual, this was a rather vague expression to read, but by now they all knew that this smile meant she was exceptionally pleased.

Honoka and Miyuki vengefully glared at their own terminals.

Unfortunately, Tatsuya had put Shizuku on the main screen and vice versa. Personal handheld devices differed when viewing through the main screen or side screens in that it was difficult for the latter to differentiate facial expressions.

“So, what’s up?”

“Ah, I heard from Honoka that you also have a vampire incident near you. If you are aware of any details, I was wondering if you could divulge them.”

Shizuku’s head lilted to one side on the screen.

“…Shizuku?”

“…Ah, that incident. Um, are there really vampires appearing in Japan?”

“What do you mean by Japan?”

“They’re still treating it like an urban legend over here in America. At the very least, there’s no media coverage.”

Though somewhat different from myths or storybook creatures, vampires, or more accurately spirit-devouring demons, truly existed.

Given that an actual entity was relegated to a rumor, something must be afoot. In other words, this incident was still being censored in the USNA. There was now a possibility that the web was more complex than he previously imagined.

“Rumors are fine. I would like to know as much as possible.”

“Did something happen?”

Shizuku leaned forward on the screen.

Tatsuya deliberated over when to inform the young girl on foreign soil by herself that one of their friends had been attacked.

“Leo was attacked by what we suspect to be a vampire.”

Yet, he immediately made the decision that she had the right to know.

In the end, Tatsuya himself was unable to explain why he made that choice.

This may have been an instinctive response.

Alternately, he might have felt a premonition of what is to come.

“Fortunately, his life is not in danger.”

“How…?”

Still, causing the person on the other side of the line to worry needlessly was not his original intention. Though Tatsuya added another sentence to help alleviate the shock Shizuku felt, they unfortunately seemed to fall on deaf ears.

“No, he’s actually fine, so please don’t have that look on your face, alright? Leo used his own strength to repel the perpetrator, except he was slightly injured by his opponent’s special powers during that time. Currently, he is resting in the hospital.”

Tatsuya’s “comforting words” definitely failed to constitute anything remotely capable. Any words like hospital rest would only inflame her unease if she was of a weaker constitution.

“Really? Thank goodness…”

Thankfully, Shizuku was not the type to sink into despair or pessimism. Seeing Tatsuya give an energetic nod, she sighed in relief.

This type of conversation could only be achieved through video calls.

“I see, so that’s why Tatsuya-kun wants to know about anything related to this.”

Tatsuya once again gave the affirmative to Shizuku’s words that were not phrased as a question.

“However, that doesn’t mean you have to investigate too much.”

Before all that, he absolutely had to remind her about this.

“If you could tell me anything you are aware of, that would be more than enough.”

“But you believe there are clues in America, right?”

“More like hunting for clues. To be honest, I believe that the perpetrator of the vampire incident came from America.”

Shizuku was not the only one to betray her astonishment.

He hadn’t even informed Honoka or even Miyuki about this leap in logic.

“That’s why I don’t want you to do anything dangerous, Shizuku. Definitely avoid doing anything that would put you at risk. Information from your end is not absolutely critical.”

“…Got it, I won’t act rashly. So, please wait for me without any high expectations.”

“I wanted to ask just in case, you are telling me not to have high hopes about collecting information and not about doing anything reckless, did I get that correct?”

“Of course.”

Though Shizuku was neither an idiot nor a bumbling fool, he still didn’t feel completely at ease even after reminding her one more time.




Based on Erika’s knowledge, currently there were three organized groups taking action against the serial vampire incidents in the city.

The first group was headed by the police, with the police department’s special investigative unit (basically the Japanese version of the FBI) leading various public safety divisions on the hunt.

The second investigative group consisted of members from the Ten Master Clans, with the Saegusa Family leading the way and the Juumonji Family right behind them. They had the backing of the Internal Affairs (Cabinet Department of Information Control) and assisted the police in a half official, half civilian role. The only difference was that, contrary to normal, the “civilian” half held the advantage.

The third group was the private vigilante team assembled by the Chiba Family with the famous authority on Ancient Magic, the Yoshida Family, in support.

In short, this was Erika’s group.

“Wouldn’t it be better if we joined forces with our senpais…?”

The nature of the request from the Chiba Family to the Yoshida Family might not be official business, but the request for aid itself was completely by the book. In response, Mikihiko was immediately appointed as a liaison, to which he voiced the same question that he asked for at least the 10th time since yesterday.

Needless to say, the target for his words was his partner in this operation, Erika.

“I believe that we would be much more efficient if we had access to the Anti-Crime System provided by the street cameras.”

“No worries. Even the police, who have the greatest access to the surveillance systems, have yet to sniff out a trail.”

“Then in terms of manpower, I think that cooperating would be much better than trying to solo this.”

“Which is why I asked you for help, right?”

“No, not just the two of us…”

Mikihiko gave up trying to convince the rapidly advancing Erika and quickly sprinted to catch up until he was standing shoulder to shoulder with her.

“We won’t find anything by just meandering around pointlessly…”

He was talking to himself, but also grumbling at the same time. This wasn’t a volume that Erika could hear, but she would probably ignore this even if she heard him. If pressed for a reason, this was the real reason why Mikihiko was selected as Erika’s companion.

The Yoshida Family was a clan that passed on Ancient Magic in the Shinto style. While not completely the same as families specializing as Onmyoshi, their combat prowess was still outstanding. Originally, this country traditionally allowed easy access to techniques among religious groups. Based on the fact that a Shinto style group was using talismans as a medium, they were not a stickler for the rules.

After hearing from Toshikazu that a scientific approach to the investigation yielded little results, the commanding officer from the Chiba Family (Toshikazu and Erika’s father), decided to rely on the skills that Ancient Magic users excelled in and formally requested cooperation from the head of the Yoshida Family, which was their closest friend among the Ancient Magic families. Since the head of the Chiba Family was a “mysterious eccentric” who personally believed that he was “useless without magic abilities”, he probably felt that “the occult could only be combatted with supernatural powers”.

Based on that, Mikihiko wasn’t accompanying Erika as a guide, but as a “fortune teller”.

“Miki, which way?”

Coming to a stop at the intersection, Erika turned her head to ask.

I really wish you could be a little more polite, Mikihiko mentally sighed to himself as he placed the less than meter long, more like three feet long, wooden staff on the road. As a side note, after Lina decided to jump on the bandwagon for “Miki”, he officially gave up trying to change it.

Rather than calling it a wooden staff, it was more like a thin, long wooden cane covered in tiny characters written in black ink. The tip of the cane was almost perfectly round.

He put a hand on one end to make sure it stood straight and then lightly removed his hand.

While it was perpendicular to the ground, the ground beneath was pavement, so a simple wooden cane would not be able to pierce through.

Yet, without any supporting struts, Mikihiko’s wooden cane was standing upright on the ground.

Mikihiko fell back three steps and swiftly turned around. The moment his body turned around, the wooden cane lost its unseen support and clattered to the ground.

With a sorrowful sound, it rolled across the ground and finally pointed towards the right of the intersection.

“This way…”

Erika walked in the direction that the cane pointed in. Forget waiting for her companion, she didn’t even bother to turn her head.

Mikihiko chuckled wryly and picked up his cane before hurrying after Erika. Just before catching up to her, he suddenly seemed to recall something and pulled out an information terminal from his inside pocket. The terminal was set on broadcast. After verifying that the terminal was still broadcasting his position to the information network that he registered at beforehand, he put it back into his pocket.

The wry grin vanished from Mikihiko’s face. He had a premonition that they were getting closer to their target.

He slowed down after closing to one step behind Erika and pulled out the terminal again while maintaining the same distance.

He called out a list of location names. After dragging another new entry into the list, Mikihiko replaced his terminal and walked alongside Erika as they advanced.




He wore a large overcoat and a hat pulled down by the brim. Beneath the hat, there was a gray cloth with a pattern of black bats that covered the entire face. Charles Sullivan, he who had been bestowed the name of Demus Second with Stars, was currently using all of his strength to flee for his life.

However, no matter how he tried, he could not escape the pursuit. The hunter chasing him was not from Stardust, but an executioner bearing the name of the brightest star in the night sky.

A Magician with flaming red hair and golden eyes chased after Sullivan. After transforming into Angie Sirius, Lina had already been immersed in psion noise several times. Every time, she felt that she was going to lose Sullivan’s trail,

“High Commander, take the next right.”

But Sullivan’s location was completely locked on by the psion radar that was emanating from the mobile base disguised as a news van. In this regard, the USNA was a step ahead of Japan. With a radar that could identify psion wave signatures, it was practically impossible to escape from within the radar’s sensitivity range. Furthermore, so long as Lina had that miniature, hand held radar signal broadcaster, fleeing out of radar range was out of the question.
