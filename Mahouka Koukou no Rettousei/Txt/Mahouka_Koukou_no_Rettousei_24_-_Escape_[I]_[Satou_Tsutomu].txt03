	“Then it wouldn’t have been much of match” Erika cut her off.





	It is not merely a matter of difference in ability. Tomitsuka, who cannot fight at a distance, and Miyuki, who can overwhelm her enemy with a magical bombardment from afar.





	If the rules for a contactless battle were used, which are usually used in mock battles with the opposite sex, it would be a one-sided fight.





	“Tomitsuka-kun had obviously lost the ability to make decisions calmly.”





	“And Minami stretched her body out so that he could cool his head.” Erika nodded with an understanding face.





	“By the way, I haven’t heard about it, but why did Tomitsuka-kun ask for a mock fight?”





At this point, Mikihiko realized that he also did not know the cause of the mock





	“Tomitsuka-sempai wanted to know where Shiba-sempai is.”





Izumi answered this question because she thought Miyuki wouldn't want to answer.





	“Tatsuya’s address?”





	Not only Mikihiko had a question mark surface above his head.





	“Tomitsuka-sempai’s mother seems to have been hospitalized.”





	“The mother of Tomitsuka-kun... As far as I know, isn’t she the Chairman of the Magic Association?”





	“Yes. As expected, Yoshida-sempai knows it too.”





	Mikihiko was not embarrassed by the praise of Izumi. Because his attention was focused on the continuation of the story.





	“Hitsui-sama... That's the name of Tomitsuka-sempai’s mother, seems to have been severely pressured by the government, demanding her to persuade Shiba-sempai.”





	“To persuade him to take part in Project Dione?”





	“Yes. It seems that she got an acute gastric ulcer due to the stress... and will be hospitalized for about a month.”





“— ... It's not Tatsuya's fault, is it?” Leo wedged into the conversation.





	“I think so.”





Izumi immediately nodded. No one objected to the judgement that Leo and Izumi came to.





	“Tomitsuka-sempai said the same thing. But in reality... He clearly thought Shiba-sempai was responsible. He wanted to know the address of Shiba-sempai so he could try to persuade him to participate in Project Dione. ”





“He wanted to do something... For his mother.” Mizuki muttered with sympathy.





	“Speaking of which, Tomitsuka-kun... Looked very depressed after the match.” Even Honoka, who previously condemned Tomitsuka for his rude behavior, yielded to this atmosphere of sympathy.





	“But to blame this on Tatsuya-kun is, I will say, a misunderstanding.” Erika hacked that sympathy at the root.





	“Hasn’t Tatsuya already told them, what he is going to do now? And I think it's wrong to stop him or accuse him.”— Leo objected to the actions of Tomitsuka, looking at them from a different angle.





	“However, I think that people who say the same thing as Tomitsuka-sempai are not going anywhere. I'm talking about the people who think that Shiba-sempai is wrong, and that they are right.”





	Kasumi was not emotionally attached to Tatsuya, and did not sympathize with him or his position. She could therefore draw conclusions from a convenient third-party position. Neither Miyuki, nor Erika, nor anyone else, could object to her prediction.





	Chapter 8





	There was a big change in the situation surrounding Tatsuya on this Thursday.





	At the Center for the Development of Magic for the Indo-Persian Union, Hyderabad University, located in the former South India, the leading figure of this university in the field of magic engineering, known as the designer of the Strategic Class Magic "Agni Downburst", the female scientist Asha Chandrasekhar was holding a press conference.





	“— ... For these reasons, we do not support the USNA’s project for the development of Venus, but we do support the Japanese fusion reactor project.”





Dr. Chandrasekhar announced that they supported Tatsuya’s Project ESCAPES instead of Project Dione. Until this moment, the Indo-Persian Federation had not revealed their stance on Project Dione.





	Despite the fact that it was not an official message from the government, and only a press conference held by one scientist, the rejection of Project Dione was a big surprise for the rest of the country.





	Moreover, the reason for this rejection was that they wanted to support the building of an energy plant, which was not a national project yet but only a simple private business project, which was announced by a young Japanese.





	Tatsuya’s Project ESCAPES attracted the attention of the whole world before its official name was even defined.





	“— that is, you say that the Turkish Government believes that USNA should not force other countries to participate in their space exploration project?”





	The day after the press conference of Dr. Asha Chandrasekhar, the TV channel opposing the USNA televised an interview to whole world. An interview with Ali Shaheen, the Turkish "Apostle".





This interview was shown all day on the television networks of North America and western Europe.





	“This is not the government's opinion. It is my personal opinion that the use of magic for peaceful purposes should be decided by the individual and not be forced upon them.”





	In this interview Shaheen expressed his negative opinion about Project Dione.





	“For example, recently in Japan, an innovative project was announced that used the Stellar Furnace.”





	“Do you mean the project that Dr. Chandrasekhar from the Indo-Persian Union also mentioned yesterday?”





	“Yes. I don't know if you know or not, but the fusion reactor using Gravitational Control will solve one of the Three Great Puzzles of Weight Systematic Magic. The young man named Shiba Tatsuya does not only use this project to achieve his goals, but also tries to achieve peaceful use of magic.”





	“This is a rather ambitious project.”





	“Yes, I think so too. I wonder if a trend of peaceful use of magic will spread around the world? I believe that Project Dione is a wonderful project, but I think they should refrain from behavior that can limit other potential possibilities.”





	Since Ali Shaheen's speech was not as intrusive as the press conference of Dr.



	Chandrasekhar, it was seen more by the people from America and Europe.





	“I know what Shaheen is up to.”





	The Official State recognized Strategic Class Magician of the New Soviet Union, one of the "Thirteen apostles", Lieutenant General Leonid Kondrachenko appeared on the screen and squeezed his lips after a strong aversion.



	“— This boy wants to prevent further cooperation between our country and America.”





	Ali Shaheen is 30 years old. For Kondratenko, who is already over 70, he was undoubtedly a "boy".





	"That's why Shaheen wants to stop Project Dione, by showing his negative impression of it. This is because our country has cooperated with America for this project. And this boy wants to ruin it.”





	“— Is it possible that Shaheen acts spurred Japan on?” Igor asked. His own investigation has not revealed any influence of Shaheen on Japan, nor any latent connection between them in this case. But Igor thought that Kondrachenko, who was in the same position as Shaheen, could know some circumstances that he did not know himself.





“No.” Kondrachenko clearly defined his answer. “If someone that wasn’t in Turkey came into contact with Shaheen, I would have known about it. This time, he came up with this idea himself.”





	“Wasn't it a good time to do that?”





	“After you, the doctor, announced your cooperation with Project Dione, Shaheen had some time to look for things that could prevent this project. If our country and America unite efforts, it will be the worst nightmare for him.”





	“So, the reason that he announced this was Shiba Tatsuya’s project of a plant with a Stellar Furnace?”





	“Right. For Shaheen, this was like finding a well in the wilderness. And he jumped with glee.”





	“But he did not immediately understand whether it was possible to drink the water from this well. This explains the delay of a few days before he took action.”



	“The decision to use Shiba Tatsuya’s project took a maximum of 2-3 days. After that he was preparing his interview, and came to an agreement with the American TV companies. That's how it really happened





	Igor did not object to the assumption made by Kondrachenko. Albeit with minor differences, he thought about the same.





	“By the way, doctor. What do you intend to do? I think we can’t rely on Edward Clark anymore.”





	“Really...”





	He also agreed with Kondrachenko. Igor came to this conclusion when Edward Clark had failed in the act of trying to use the international public opinion.





“I'm going back to Vladivostok right now. This time I'm going to take "Player". *





	[The author uses the Russian word "Player" in the original text. Why this is, is discussed next.]





	“Does that mean?”





	“Yes. We can no longer overlook that Strategic Class Magic, which at any time can bear their fangs towards our country.”





	“Oh... I pray for your success.”





	When Igor said he was taking "Player". The eyes of Kondrachenko, knowing the meaning of these words, shone.





	On Saturday, it started to rain around noon.





	However, in Miyuki’s head it was sunny. After returning home from school, her next destination was the villa in Izu, where Tatsuya lived. She got permission from Tatsuya to come for a sleepover.





	Minami was heavily strained by the blissful behavior of her mistress. Instead of the mistress, who lacked a sense of caution, it was natural to watch the environment with caution for her sense of duty. And for some reason, from the moment they left the house, they were constantly haunted by some kind of unpleasant premonition.





	Minami told herself that she was thinking about it too much. Moderate stress is good for a bodyguard, but if it exceeds a certain level, the effect will be reversed. Besides, where they're going, there's Tatsuya. With him nearby, Miyuki’s safety will be guaranteed. Minami’s power will not be needed...





	No matter what Minami told herself, her anxiety did not disappear. But she could not understand the cause for concern.





	They reached Izu before sunset, but the surrounding area was completely dark because of the rain and fog.





	It was a terrible situation when the naked eye could not see further than 10 meters, but the automated driving system and the high-precision positioning system helped even in such adverse conditions. But sitting in the driver seat was Hanabishi Hyougo, who could probably still drive well even under these circumstances.





	The car with Miyuki and Minami arrived at Tatsuya’s villa without almost any delay.





	“Hanabishi-san, good job.”





	Tatsuya, who came out to meet them under an umbrella, first of all thanked Hyougo who came out of the car.





	“Thanks.”





	On the answering Hyougo’s face one could barely discern the curved smile, that appeared, perhaps, because of the feeling that someone stole some of his work. Guilty of stealing the work of Hyougo, Tatsuya did not care that he was getting wet himself, he opened the back door and positioned the umbrella so that Miyuki would not get wet. It was Minami, who got down from the front passenger seat, and ahead Hyogo, walked around the car.





	“Miyuki, you're here. Minami too, good work.”





	“Onii-sama, I'm sorry about the intrusion.”





	Oblivious to the look of Hyougo, Miyuki opened her umbrella and elegantly greeted Tatsuya. Minami silently bowed to Tatsuya and went to help Hyougo carry luggage from the car. However, out of the building soon came a self-propelled trolley with a roof, and took even the work of these two.





"Miyuki, Minami, get inside first.”





	Tatsuya sent two girls inside, and he spoke to Hyougo.





	“Hanabishi-san, did you want to tell me something?”





	“No, I'm not assigned to give you anything today. Just take care of Miyuki-sama.”





	“Does that mean there's no traffic anywhere?”





	“It does, if we are talking about the situation inside the country.”





	Tatsuya slightly frowned his eyebrows from Hyougo’s manner of speech, clearly having a hidden meaning.





	“So there is movement in other countries?”



	“I dare to assume that Tatsuya-sama has already heard about the press conference of Dr. Chandrasekhar and about Shaheen's interview.”





	“Yes, I know.”





	The conversation, standing in the rain, prolonged, but neither Tatsuya nor Hyougo was bothered about it.





	"However, there was no response from the USNA or the New Soviet Union.”





	“Do you mean that this is quite unnatural?”





	“As you say.”





	“I got it. ... I will just have to be on guard and be on the lookout.”





	“We will try to continue to collect information.”





	Hanabishi Hyougo had his own information route associated with his practice in the British PMCs. At the moment, Tatsuya was not in touch with the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion, so Hyougo was his most reliable acquaintance through which he could explore the activities of other countries.





	“I am in your care.”





“As you wish. In that case, I'm saying goodbye to you today.”





	Hyougo politely bowed, dried his clothes soaked from the rain with magic, and sat down on the driver's seat.





	When Tatsuya returned inside the villa, a number of cups of hot coffee were already on the table in the living room. To the deep discontent of Minami, Pixie prepared them.





	Instead of changing, Miyuki and Minami quickly drank their coffee to get warm, then left to change clothes. They went "together" because Minami expressed her intentions of taking care of Miyuki.

	Returning to the living room, Miyuki was dressed in a comfortable integral dress in the form of the letter T. Along with the mysterious elegance created by the Miyuki’s appearance, the feeling of the grace of a high-ranking priestess was also present.





	Minami was in a cardigan and skirt. Although it was not her usual "dress + apron", but even so she looked like she was wearing a skirt like apron. That's how she created her image.





	“Miyuki, and Minami, too, sit down. I want to hear what happened during the time I was gone.”





	Having said that, Tatsuya in advance wanted to prevent the start of a rivalry between Pixie and Minami for the kitchen. Minami did not become mischievous, she also wanted a little rest. Because she's not a robot that does not fatigue.





	“Let me think... Maybe we should talk about Wednesday.”





	Minami sat, not showing any discontent on her face (in other words, in reality she was unhappy with it). Miyuki, sitting next to her and opposite to Tatsuya, mentally smiled bitterly and began the story.





	“Tomitsuka-kun came to the School Council room and asked when Onii-sama plans to visit the school next time.”





	Miyuki called Tatsuya "Onii-sama" like the other day and spoke with no more hesitation or embarrassment.





	“And you couldn't answer him.”





	Tatsuya did not pay attention to the use of "Onii-sama", and showed no sign of doubt in the sudden request of Tomitsuka.





	“I told him that. But then he wanted to meet Onii-sama, and asked where this villa is located.”





“Were there any urgent matters?”





	But having heard that he did not just want to wait at school, and was even prepared to go to him, Tatsuya, as expected, showed interest.





	“Yes. Tomitsuka-kun seems to want to try to convince Onii-sama.”





	“What does he want to convince me of? Why?”





	Tatsuya asked both "what" and "why". When he heard about his conviction, he quickly guessed that it was about Project Dione. But Tatsuya could not understand why Tomitsuka decided to make such excessive actions. Maybe because of the connection between them as classmates?





	Answering Tatsuya’s question, Miyuki explained the development of events from the very beginning in detail. The explanation of the circumstances in which Minami was also involved, sometimes by inserting explanations, took some time.





	“— ... So that's how it was? I even feel sorry for him.”





	Tatsuya indifferently expressed his impression of Tomitsuka, having finished listening to the story to the end.





	“Even Minami was concerned about him.”





	For Minami, he, on the contrary, cared more.





	“No, nothing like that, thank you for your concern.”





	Though Minami responded instantly, she could not conceal her embarrassment. Her behavior seems to have been that she didn't expect Tatsuya to be worried about her.





	“In direct combat, Tomitsuka is a strong opponent. Although you were saved by his simplicity, but you're very lucky that it ended without injury. You shouldn't have been so reckless.”





	From the words "You were saved by his simplicity" Minami made a barely noticeable frown. She felt uncomfortable when she was reminded again that she had been subjected to the bad thoughts from a representative of the opposite sex. But in the end, realizing that this voice carries a real concern, Minami was again confused.





	“Yes... Thank you very much.”





	Miyuki looked at these two with a little scary smile.





	Immediately upon arrival in Vladivostok, the data on the location of Shiba Tatsuya was received from an officer of the Foreign Intelligence service.





	“He is staying in a villa in Izu with his fiancée...?”





	His stay away from the localities was convenient. Of course, it would be better for him to be alone, but there is nothing to be done. Igor heard that the bride, who is his cousin, is also a mighty magician, but he was sure of his magic. All the more so now that this time he had brought his external terminal "Igrok" *, which amplifies his magic power.



	[Previously described as “Player”]





	Igor was a man born from artificial insemination, which in the old way was called a "baby from a test tube".





	It was not through gene manipulation, but through the production of countless fertilized eggs, and among them was he chosen the most successful specimen. And he was officially recognized by the New Soviet Union as a Strategic Class Magician Igor Andreivitch Bezobrazzoff.





	Of course, there were attempts to biochemically copy his fertilized egg, and as a result clones were created, which can be called his "younger sisters". They were expected to become the same as Igor, Strategic Class Magicians. And in fact, seven clones mastered the Strategic Class Magic "Tuman Bomba".





	However, the clones who received the middle name "Andreevna" had health problems. None of them could live normally outside of a sterile room.





	And in terms of Magic power, they, unfortunately, were greatly inferior to Igor. Although they could actually activate "Tuman Bomba", but in terms of range and activation speed they were not fit for real battles.





	But even if they were not used separately, they were useful as external terminals to help Igor.





	They were clones, different from their original, Igor. Therefore, it was not difficult for him to synchronize his Magic Calculation Area with them.





	In order for the mind to be intact, which is the basis, and not to receive damage, Andreevna were deprived of their "ego", and were living machines, "Players", used only to activate the magic of a "conductor" Igor. He directs the way the players "Play" magic. This was the role of the clones, called "Andreevna", and how they were forced to live.





	[The author conveys the meaning, using a mixture of Russian, English and Japanese words. The translation was not very explanatory, so I will explain: the word "player" means "player of an musical instrument", and "Play" magic, means how to perform it in the form of music. These are all expressions, and in fact nobody plays anything, but just conjures.]





	Every time Igor uses one of them, their minds are broken down. But Igor does it without hesitation.





	He could have had such a fate. But for a winner in a survival competition, acting like a loser is unnatural. Though he was created, Igor couldn’t choose any other path in life than being one of the leading scientist of the New Soviet Union. Even now, things remain unchanged and he has no choice but to use Igrok.





	He entrusted his assistant with the final adjustments to the large CAD that was being towed by a military train on the New Siberian Railroad.





The movement of each of the "Thirteen apostles", the magicians of Strategic Class, have a huge impact on the world’s military balance, and has always been in the spotlight of other countries. Igor of the New Soviet Union, whose movement had been very difficult to trace, was now quite easy to see, so among the thirteen apostles he was given special attention. The thirteen apostles remained thirteen, because after the announcement of the death of Liu Yunde, Liu Li lei took his place.





	And for Japan, in particular, Igor was a Strategic Class Magician from an unfriendly country with which they share common borders. They are a direct threat. Moreover, the attacks carried out in April in the coastal waters of Sado Island and in the Soya Strait were assumed to have been performed by the magic of Igor’s "Tuman Bomba".





	Monitoring his actions and his continued behavior was a crucial issue in Japan's National Defense.





	Saturday evening, June 8th.



	Responsible for 1-0-1 Brigade, Lieutenant General Saeki Hiromi received important news through her private channel, and not through the official army channels.





	The news said that Igor together with his personal train moved to the Far East.





	“Although it says the "Far East", the Russian seaside region is quite large... He's probably in Vladivostok. And yet, what is this personal train...?”





	There was such information that to activate Tuman Bomb you need to use a huge CAD the size of a truck or train wagon. According to this unverified information, there was such a theory that Igor moves through the territory of the New Soviet Union on his personal train with an attached wagon-CAD, thus meaning that he could be using Tuman Bomba.





	If this information is correct, the range of Tuman Bomb is not as large as that of Material burst which can be used from anywhere on Earth.





	For magic, in fact, the physical distance does not matter.





	But to overcome the real "distance", a deep understanding of magic and strong self-confidence is required. And also we can say that you need willpower to deny "erroneous common sense".





	If Igor is inferior to Tatsuya in this aspect then that means it might be necessary for him to approach his target to use Tuman Bomba.





	At the same time, it also means that once Igor has moved on a personal train to the Far East, it means that he is using Tuman Bomba on the nearby Japan.



	Japan itself can also be his goal.





	This time it was impossible to deny direct guidance to the lands of Honshu,

	Shikoku, Kyushu and Hokkaido.





	“— ... In the current circumstances, there is a high probability of the target being "him".”





	Saeki thought he should be warned. However, as a result of thinking about it for a minute, she decided to leave it as it is.





	More precisely, she decided to keep on observing. Saeki took the intercom device and dialed a short number.





	“— ... Lieutenant Colonel Kazama, it's me. Sorry for the late call, but urgently come to my office.”





	Tension after the events in the Soya Strait have already gone, and now was a relatively peaceful time. Although it was quite late, Kazama still appeared quite quickly.





	---If it is Kazama, he should be able to observe what happens while understanding “him”.





	---If it goes smoothly, we can find Igor using “him”.





	So Saeki thought when thinking about the most profitable outcome.





With Miyuki at his villa, Tatsuya suspended his research and became her partner for this time.





	Not out of a sense of duty, but because Tatsuya himself wanted to talk to Miyuki, and spend time with her.





	Perhaps it was due to the mental reconfiguration, conducted by his mother Miya. If all emotions were limited to just one emotion, then the result was that it would likely heighten the remaining emotion.





	However, Tatsuya believed that this was not a problem.





	If his feelings were not manipulated…





	If he had his own free will, he could envy his almost perfect little sister, he could shun Miyuki, he could even hate her.





	When the older brother is inferior in talent, usually in most cases he is jealous of the younger sister and hates her.





	Therefore Tatsuya thought that it would be better, like now, that he had no such feelings for Miyuki.





	... But it also had a limit.





	After they dined and took a bath (this time they took baths separately), Miyuki requested the both of them to sleep together, but Tatsuya, as expected, could not agree.





	“Miyuki... Sleeping in the same bed is a bit...”





	Naturally under the word sleep it was meant to sleep, without any erotic subtext.





	She seems to have prepared for it in advance. Miyuki "begged" just to sleep on the same bed. It was like a little kid begging a parent to sleep together.

	“We can't...?”





	Tatsuya felt dizzy. He felt ashamed that he could not say "impossible" right now.





	“— ... The other day, I slept in a Japanese-style futon. I think the best compromise would be if we lay in separate futons in the same room.”





	“That'll do. Thank you very much, Onii-sama!”





	Miyuki joyfully waved her hands in front of her, showing a good mood.





	"Nothing can be done" Tatsuya sighed mentally.





	Igor took the place of the operator of the big CAD "Argan", in which there were two "Igroks" placed in sterile capsules, Anna Andreevna and Veronica Andreevna.





	"Argan" was just a common name. The meaning of the word was the same as the word "organ". Igor commands them like a "pipe organ". One government official who saw this CAD that occupies an entire vehicle said it looks just like a “pipe organ” and the name stuck and was adopted.





	[The author may have read about the Maskovskij dialect somewhere, where the "o" is pronounced as "a". I don't know how else to explain this writing.]





	They were similar only in size and shape, with pipes protruding from the sides and from behind.





	“Players” are stuck inside the capsules and the “conductor” closes them in while sitting in a luxurious chair.





	Igrok actually has seven capsules in total. But not all of them are necessary. To only activate Tuman Bomba, Igor alone is enough. Igrok is a subsidiary and safety device, and for this scale of an operation two people were more than enough.





Igor ran his eyes through the information about the vicinity of the target obtained from the information network of the army of the New Soviet Union.





	The weather in the targeted area is shallow rain. There's no wind. These were close to optimal conditions for the application of Tuman Bomba.





	The current time is 6 o'clock in the morning. The local time in Japan is 5 o'clock in the morning, the target should still be asleep.





	Igor prepared to activate the magic that turned their usual dream into an eternal dream.





	In a Japanese-style room, where the ritual to remove the seal was held last month, two futons were now laying side by side.





	Two mattresses were stacked, tightly lying next to each other, without a gap between them.





	Under thin summer blankets a brother slept with his sister, Tatsuya and Miyuki.



	Both the young man and woman are engaged to each other.





	However, the bedding of these two had no noticeable disturbance. Naturally, everyone had not only their own mattress, but also their own blanket. Their futons, sheets and pajamas only had signs of bruising from moving in their sleep.





	Miyuki with a happy face slept on her side, turning to Tatsuya. Tatsuya quietly slept on his back.





	There still was some time before dawn.





	Even at the earliest moment, it would still take 30 minutes until Tatsuya’s alarm clock was going to go off.





	Neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki had shown any signs of awakening.





	The supercomputer, which comes with the CAD "Argan", converts these targets’ positions from the monitoring device into a format that can be used in CAD. At the same time, the original activation sequence data required to build the magic sequence is created by the supercomputer under the control of Igor.





	Rather than defining elements of the activation sequence within your mind, Igor builds an Activation Sequence based on conditions that were entered into the computer through the console. In doing so, he could build extremely complex and confusing activation sequences, impossible for ordinary magicians.





	This CAD uses the same equipment-type computer that is located in the Far East Headquarters of the New Soviet Scientific Academy. The performance of the CAD at the academy is much high, however it doesn’t have a system designed to use Igrok. Igor brought Argan because he decided that the assistance of Igrok was necessary for this operation.





	Igrok forces whomever is in to sleep by using electric stimuli, but he can still extract the psions from the Andreevna sisters. The naked women in their late teens are immersed in a physiological saline that adjusts to the same temperate as their current body temperatures. They wear respiratory masks since they aren’t conscious.





	However, the capsules did not have any transparent windows, besides, they were already loaded inside Argan, so no one could see their faces at the moment. But if you could see their faces it would reflect the sight of someone in agony, but neither Igor nor his staff would raise an eyebrow if they saw them suffering.





	Immediately after the infusion of psions by Igor into the main module of Argan, the Activation Sequence starts. Igor and the Andreevna sisters read the Activation



	Sequence simultaneously. Igor consciously forces the two Igrok’s regardless of their consciousness.





	Argan adjusts the Activation speed of all three of them so that the magic output timings are matched. These three people including Igor, automatically start up the Magic Activation Sequence which will activate the Strategic Class Magic, Tuman Bomba.





	Evil intent threatens me and Miyuki.





	Tatsuya instantly surfaced from the depths of sleep to the waking surface.





	(Decomposition of water... formation and recombination of oxyhydrogen gas)





	Immediately after awakening, Tatsuya found the nature of the evil intent and the nature of the magic used.





	(Tuman Bomba!?)





	The rain, which went on for a long time, has already turned into a fog.





	The process of dividing the rain drops into fog.





	The process of the evaporation of fog into water vapor.





	The process of decomposing water into oxygen and hydrogen.





	And finally, the process of simultaneously connecting hydrogen with oxygen, and igniting.





	Tatsuya recognized the nature of the Strategic Class Magic "Tuman Bomba".





	He almost unconsciously stretched out his hand to the pistol shaped CAD Silver Horn Customized modification of the "Trident " which he left near his cushion.





	... When he sleeps, he always keeps his favorite CAD within the reach of his hand.





	Countermeasures were prepared, taking into account the experience he gained while supporting the battle in the Soya Strait.





	The chosen magic was not Gram Dispersion, but Mist Dispersion.

	Tatsuya targeted the modification of the phenomenon that decomposes water. Decomposition of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.





	The purpose of the modification is that all water molecules generated by the hydrogen and oxygen fusion within a radius of 50 meters will be decomposed.





	Tuman Bomba activated.





	Mist Dispersion activated.





	The conflicting modifications of the two mages clashed and the challenge between both mages failed.





	"Not completely!"





	The enemy’s attack hadn’t finished yet. The magic that copies the Sequence of Tuman Bomba, “Chain cast” had not finished yet





	With a slight delay, new drops of rain were falling from the sky.





	“Leave it to me!”





	Miyuki’s magic activated at the same moment when Tatsuya heard her voice.





	She activated “Freeze Flame” which is a Speed-Type and Oscillation-Type wide area magic that can freeze even fire. It is a conceptual magic that prevents anything from burning.





	"Onii-sama, now!"





	“Understood!”





	Now, in a 100 meter radius around the villa, nothing could ignite.





	Using the time Miyuki won, Tatsuya sent his "eyes" at the operator of "Tuman Bomba".



	Exploring the "link" aimed at him and Miyuki, he "searched" for the source of malice.





	But he "saw" something else. The enemy attack had not yet ended. Beyond the range of Miyuki’s, high up in the sky, a new Tuman Bomba was prepared.





	Even when the first and second blows of Tuman Bomba were prevented, Igor was not worried.





	Tatsuya was not the only one who gained valuable experience in the Battle at the Soya Strait.





	When Igor suggested that his enemy was the Strategic Class Magician, wielding the magic of converting mass into energy. He conducted simulations to find countermeasures in the case they were to face off again.





	The data he had entered into the supercomputer Argan was the data he had obtained from that tactical simulation to create a chain of Activation Sequences.





	Although he did not expect an enemy that prevented anything from burning, but it can’t stop it when the phenomenon has already occurred, so he aims outside of the range of Freeze Flame. In such a case, countermeasures should not be changed.





	The simulation based magic attack has already been launched. Igor sat on his conductor’s chair and waited for the moment when his victory would be confirmed.





	Tatsuya "saw" that at an altitude of 200 meters above the villa, a rain cloud was producing a dense fog in the shape of a funnel.





	This was outside of the range of Miyuki’s "Freeze Flame".





	The shape of the inverted funnel was obviously to achieve the Monroe effect.





	Tatsuya tried to destroy the structure.





	However, even with his Activation Speed for decomposition, he could not prevent Tuman Bomba, which has already come to its final stage. He did not have enough time to read the structure of the magic that formed a funnel from the misty mass.





	The foggy mass is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen, but the oxyhydrogen gas is getting ready to ignite.





	According to the Monroe effect, the shock wave of the ignition will be concentrated at one single point.





	And the point of concentration was not in the hole of this funnel, but much lower, right at the villa.





	“Victory!”





	This was the final step in the sequence of the three attacks.





	Igor was sure of his victory, receiving the response of a successful attack, which was the same as saying checkmate.





	As a side effect of the use of magic, the rain clouds covering the sky are now gone. Igor doesn’t have a low-orbiting reconnaissance satellite this time, but he is making use of another satellite that is further away.





	Igor accessed the observation date of this satellite using the command function installed in the CAD Argan.





	“What!?” An astonished voice bursted out.





	The image that appeared on the portable monitor had a completely intact villa.





	Having taken the concentrated shock wave created by Tuman Bomba, the wooden building should not remain whole.





According to an analysis conducted half a day ago by a spy satellite, the villa was a regular wooden structure.





	There was a possibility that it could be equipped with a shelter in the basement, but that the ground part of the building would remain untouched was impossible. Except for just one possibility.





	“The magic of a protective barrier...? Able to stop such a shock wave?”





	Igor has not forgotten the existence of magic protective barriers. It was estimated that even if Shiba Tatsuya or his fiancée would have installed a shield, it would still not be able to stop the shock wave. Igor was sure of the power of the concentrated shock wave.





	This version of "Tuman Bomba" was the same magic that killed the previous Commander of the Stars, William Sirius, during a local armed conflict with the USNA, which occurred in the Bering Strait, and was named the “Arctic Hidden War” (the Arctic hidden War).





	Has Juumonji Katsuto been involved in the defense? "





	Igor was aware of the existence of Juumonji Katsuto, who possessed powerful barrier magic. Igor knew of Katsuto as the strongest threat to stop his Tuman Bomba.





	“No, there was no such information.”





	Thinking about it in his mind, this idea of Igor was immediately thrown away as a delusional thought. Intelligence should not have lost sight of the movement of such a dangerous human being.





	“But who was it then...?”





	Igor was in a predicament when he could not answer this question. Because of this senseless confusion he missed precious time... And a chance to win.





	As the shock wave came right on top. Tatsuya reflexively hugged Miyuki in an attempt to protect her.

	Minami’s morning began early.





	As a performing maid, she was getting up earlier than anyone in the Shiba family.



	Away from home, in the villa, this did not change.





	But since it was only 5 o'clock in the morning, she was still quite sluggish and sleepy. No, she didn't have a low blood pressure, but she's just not completely awake.





	Her rival Pixie was the one who finally awakened the consciousness of the half-asleep Minami.





	“Get up! Protect your master!”





	This sound, bursting in her defenseless head, was like a blow to a gong. The realization that the scream that was made right inside the brain was the active telepathy of Pixie, came after she had activated her CAD.





	In order to fulfill the purpose of the Guardian at any time, she always kept it at hand, ready for activation. She was already dressed, so it was in her apron pocket.





	Sooner than she realized it, Minami grabbed her CAD in the form of a mobile terminal in her hand, and pressed the key for quick access, channeling psions through the finger.





	She raised her eyes. In order to reduce the time required to activate magic as much as possible, she defined the coordinates for the Activation Sequence as "space in my view where there are no hard objects".





	In Minami’s head, the image of a Dome shaped Magic barrier formed, covering the roof top. Following this image, the barrier magic was activated. Immediately after that, a shock wave struck the shield.





	Tatsuya’s decomposition magic did not make it in time, but Minami’s magic made it in time because its magic shield had already completed formed.





	It was magic, stopping any physical attack.



	But such a fuzzy definition loaded the Magic Calculation Zone of the operator.



	Magic is easier when you limit the kind of objects you want to protect.





	Moreover, the flying shock wave possessed the power to break Minami’s barrier. If compared in single-layer barriers, Minami’s barriers are comparable to a Katsuto’s Phalanx. But the way to maintain the barrier is different from the Phalanx.





	In the Protective version of the Phalanx of the Juumonji family, once the barrier is formed, it usually is left on its own. Only the duration of existence is decided, and if it receives an attack, and its superior in strength, it is simply destroyed. Instead, the next barrier is prepared, that uses the destruction of the existing barrier as the condition for activation. Maintaining a multi-layered shield, creating barriers one after the other with zero delay in time – that is the protective magic of the Juumonji family.





	On the other hand, the barriers of Minami’s "Sakurai" series, is a two-stage technique of creating barriers to take on physical attacks and she has to use continuous magic power to maintain the barriers she creates and to make duplicates if necessary.





	If it is the same kind of magic, there is no harm caused by duplication. For example, Fortification magic, which Leo specializes in, does not require a higher Interference Power for the next Fortification magic.





	Minami’s barrier magic was the same.





	She continued to apply barrier magic to the same area. By doing this, Minami prevented the destruction of the barrier. But it meant that it continuously activated the magic of protection against accidental attacks, which has a heavy load, even when it does not accept any attacks. Such actions strongly overloading the Magic Calculation Area





	“... I won't lose!”





	“I Can't Lose!”





	“I will protect Miyuki!”





From an objective standpoint, Minami had no reason to be so obsessed with defending Miyuki.





	She is not encouraged to do this out of kindred love, like Tatsuya.





	Minami’s genetic aunt, Sakurai Honami took care of Miyuki like she was family, but these were the events of the past, and not related to Minami.





	They were acquired for the protection of Miyuki, or, in a certain sense, their series of improved people, "Sakurai" series, was enslaved by the Yotsuba family only to obey the orders of the young mistress.





	Minami has only lived with Miyuki for a short year.





	However, suffering from her Magic Calculation Area overheating, Minami still supported the barrier.





	Was it out of stubbornness as a magician?



	Or was it because of the distorted system of values that was used in training?



	Or was it out of fear of being thrown out after use?





	There were no such frivolous motives or other negative motives. With such motives she would not have gone to such difficulties.





	Why does she protect? Even when asking herself, Minami wasn’t able to answer this question.





	She doesn't know the reason. She doesn't need a reason.





	Having become a shield for Miyuki, Minami resisted the Strategic Class Magic “Tuman Bomba”.





	Created by the magic of Igor Andreivitch Bezzobrazoff that made oxyhydrogen gas ignite. The shock wave was over. In time, it was a short event, lasting only one moment. But this "moment" was long enough for Minami to reach her limit.

	Having received the response from the barrier that the attack stopped, Minami canceled her barrier magic. And at the same time, she lost consciousness.





	Her body lost its strength and collapsed on the floor.





	Overheating of the Magic Calculation Zone due to excessive use of magic.





	Minami fell, losing consciousness, the same way the previous Sakurai Honami lost her life.





	“What happened...?” A stunned Miyuki muttered, still being in the arms of Tatsuya.



	She also felt the activation of Tuman Bomba and the attack wave.





Her “Freeze Flame” could not protect her. After switching to counterattacking, Tatsuya also did not have the time to intercept it.





	She didn't think she was dying. Because any wound she would get, Tatsuya would cure her. No, "restore her" to be more precise.





	Somewhere in her heart there was such a dependence on someone else's kindness, that she was not afraid of the pain that was to come soon. However, the destruction that was definitely going to happen did not occur. The pain that comes with fatal injuries had not come. Miyuki, whose consciousness was occupied by the thoughts of "This is a miracle Tatsuya " and "You did it all for me", could not understand what happened.





	“Miyuki, Deceleration Zone! Radius of 30 meters!”





	“Y-yes!”



	The Freeze Flame effect had already ended. Miyuki activated the magic that Tatsuya requested without any fear of the effects of magic overlapping.





	“Deceleration Zone”



	This is the magic that slows down the movement of physical objects in the targeted area.





	In the usual case, this magic only slows down solid bodies, but Miyuki’s “Deceleration Zone was able to slow down even gas molecules. It could also inhibit the increase the speed of expansion caused by an explosion, or in other words, increase the speed of chaotic movement of air molecules. From such deceleration, the shock wave faded and lost destructive force.





	And Tatsuya and Miyuki were originally mistaken. The correct magic to confront Tuman Bomba was not "Freeze Flame", but "Deceleration Zone".





	“Pixie, take care of Minami!” Tatsuya said in to the darkness, not waiting for any confirmation of Miyuki activating her magic (because he trusted Miyuki’s magic skills).





	“Yes, sir” Pixie answered telepathically.





	He did not give more instructions.





	Now the main priority was to prevent further attacks.





	Tatsuya resumed the interrupted search of the target. He pulled his right hand over his head while holding a specialized CAD ,"Trident", in the form of a large pistol.





	With Elemental Sight, he looked for the source of Tuman Bomba. Not at the source of the explosion, but at where the magic originated from. The magician who started the magic.





	“... It's not Bezzobrazoff?”





	Tatsuya reached the Eidos of two young women. They were terribly distorted and fragile Eidoi, clearly, magicians with unsuccessful bodies.





	Igor, who was shown at a press conference about his participation in Project Dione, was a man over 40 years old. There was no guarantee that that was really him. However, he could with full confidence say that Igor was a Russian man. He wasn't supposed to be a twenty year old woman. And Elemental Sight is not mistaken.





	Traces of a disguised Eidos, done with the magic "Parade", which is used by Lina, were not used.





	“Is this another Strategic Class Magician hidden by the New Soviet Union?”





	According to rumors, in addition to thirteen official Strategic Class Magicians recognized by the State, the world is hiding... another thirty to forty additional Strategic Class Magicians.





	Tatsuya himself was "a Hidden Strategic Class Magician". No matter who the two women were, he was sure they were the source of Tuman Bomba.





	“If that is the case, I must erase them.”





	Having strongly said this, Tatsuya activated his three-stage decomposition magic "Trident", which has the same name as his favorite CAD.





	First it eliminates the event interference that is covering the magicians,



	Then it eliminates the Data Fortification that protects their body,



	And finally it decomposes the body down into its constituent elements.





	This magic does not "burn" The human body, but makes it "disappear". This magic that erases human bodies has been activated at a distance of more than a thousand kilometers.





	On the console of the large CAD "Argan", a blinking signal appeared.





	At the seat of the "conductor", which was occupied by Igor, the alarm sounded.





Igor was shocked when he checked the cause of the alarm.





At the same time he felt a strong relief, thinking: "I am saved...".





	The alert message displayed on the console was similar to the following:

	"Both capsules, in which the Igroks Anna Andreevna and Veronica Andreevna were held, exploded."





	As if they were fairy princesses, the two Andreevna sisters disappeared in the form of bubbles inside the capsules filled with saline solution.





	The increased pressure due to the vaporization of the human body exceeded the durability of the capsules, causing the excess pressure to burst and damage the Argan.





	Igor urgently evacuated Argan.





	The large CAD, which was damaged by rupture of capsules, required repair. He wouldn't be able to continue attacking even if he stayed inside.





	But now that his dolls have disappeared, he no longer was hidden from the information dimension. This made Igor afraid of this ultra-long range magic attack, that made the two bodies disappear.





	Igrok was not only an external terminals that helped to activate Igor’s magic, but at the same time they were "firewalls" protecting him. Igor released Tuman Bomba through Anna Andreevna and Veronica Andreevna.





	Now this barrier is gone. Igor was relieved that he used Argan this time around, because if he hadn’t, he might have been the one to be erased.





	Igor was not dumb enough to just get out of the Argan’s cockpit, he also popped out of the wagon shaped CAD. And, having ran away from the railway path, he stared closely at the wagon, fully occupied by one large CAD.





	No more attacks. Igor did not feel humiliation. He felt relief that he survived.





	Tatsuya erased the two enemy magicians, that he saw through the information dimension and damaged the CAD they were using, which could no longer be used to fight.





	“Miyuki, that's good enough”





	"Yes, uh, Minami-chan..."





Miyuki already understood. That she defended them with her barrier magic from the shock wave.





	“Come with me.”





	Tatsuya did not have the time to even look Miyuki in the eye and they left the Japanese style room that was used as a bedroom.





	Ignoring Tatsuya’s behavior, Miyuki hurried after him.





	And screamed when she saw Minami lying on the floor in the dining room.
