“You are in a relationship even as we speak right?”

“So you were informed.”

Katsushige didn’t bad mouth Maya, it was a positive question for her.

“The thing is… a Guardian is supposed to be your escort for someone who has dignified, excellent magic qualities within the family, that’s one of the reasons for making her a woman. Yet, even after she was placed as Katsushige-san’s Guardian, is that an excuse to keep Tsutsumi Kotona-san by your side?”

“She doesn’t only have that.”

Katsushige was trying to appeal to the usefulness of Kotona’s magical force, but he immediately said “No, that’s right” to Maya. Indeed, his main reason was to keep Kotona by his side, he didn’t think that keeping the current status quo would be a good idea.

“That’s right…”

Maya pressed one of her hands to her cheek, as if she was troubled. Although it was quite a tall figure, all of the people in the room didn’t really get the feeling that she was truly troubled.

“I don’t want to tear apart lovers from their loved ones.”

Maya somehow, was staring at Miyuki.

“Just because she has a modified body, it will not necessarily end in her premature death.”

Maya returned her gaze immediately at Katsushige.

Miyuki noticed that Maya was staring at herself, and she had no idea for the reason. Although she considered that Minami had spied on her and told her aunt, she didn’t really voice out what was in her head. Miyuki recalled the time when she was frustrated with her worries, but it was impossible to ask about the meaning behind Maya’s earlier gaze.

Without being aware of Miyuki’s feeling, Maya stared at Katsushige.

Then, she answered the nervous Katsushige with a smile.

“Very well. I have no intention in forbidding the Branch Family Head from choosing his marriage partner out of his own feelings.”

Miyuki’s body was trembling. Tatsuya looked at her anxiously, while Miyuki raised her hand to indicate that she was ok and settled herself.

Maya glanced at Miyuki from the side and returned to her conversation with Katsushige.

“As the Head of Branch Family, you don’t need to think about it that much. Katsushige-san had agreed to let go the position of family head, I’ll help you in talking to Osamu-san.”

“Thank you very much.”

Katsushige rose and lowered his head deeply.

When Katsushige looked up, Maya instructed him to return to his seat with a gesture. She sighed soon after.

“Somehow, I have no need to say this anymore…”

Maya retightened her relaxed look.

“Miyuki-san, you will be the next Family Head.”





“Yes.”

Miyuki responded to the nomination with a hard voice.

“Fortunately, all who are here have willingly given you their support, that’s not something to be ashamed of, it is good encouragement.”

“Yes Oba-sama. I will take it to heart.”

Miyuki rose, at first, bowing to Maya, then carefully bowed to everyone surrounding the table. ——She was seen to especially bow to Katsushige, due to the sitting arrangement, it might have been a bad chance of event for the both of them.

“Then, let’s resume our meal.”

When Maya said so, Hayama struck his hands twice.

Meaning——although it was incorrect to strictly say that——meat dishes were carried in. After the free meal was over with, Maya ordered only Tatsuya and Miyuki to remain in the room.




After everyone left, the table was being reset. A cup of straight tea was served for Maya, while Tatsuya got a cup of coffee and Miyuki was served milk coffee in front of her.

All of the employees left, including Hayama.

Maya put her cup to her mouth, she spoke to the two of them with a smile on her face.

“Miyuki-san, first of all, congratulations. Tatsuya-san, as well, it was quite an amount of hard work.”

“Thank you very much, Oba-ue.”

“Sorry for making you worry.”

Tatsuya and Miyuki bowed together while sitting in their chairs. The two had yet to pick up their cups.

“Then… I’ve asked the two of you to remain here, as I want to tell you a very important thing.”

Miyuki tightened herself, and it was seen by Tatsuya who sat next to her.

“As a Head of the Family, your marriage partner isn’t somone you get to choose at your own discretion. I already talked to you about this earlier.”

“——Yes.”

Miyuki held both of her hands in her lap.

“Before that… Tatsuya-san.”

“Yes.”

Suddenly, Maya called Tatsuya. As Tatsuya wasn’t prepared to be called during this conversation, he involuntarily answered in reflex while still being puzzled.

“You might not believe me when I tell you so suddenly like this, but… Miyuki-san is not your real sister.”

A sharp breath was exclaimed from Miyuki’s throat. It was a scream that Miyuki couldn’t stop from voicing out.

Miyuki placed her hands in front of her mouth while keeping her eyes wide open, she was solidified like a marble statue.

To say that her current expression was “frozen” was not appropriate. She certainly had stopped working, but the flame in her eyes swirled and her complexion had changed its color.

Compared to Miyuki, Tatsuya looked less upset. However, it was simply due to the fact that the news had exceeded the limit of what his feelings could process. He was in a sense of shock that couldn’t be cured by himself, Maya as a third party, who brought the news wasn’t connected to his own.

“Certainly, I can’t believe this. Because, there is a mountain of evidence that shows that Miyuki and I are real siblings.”

Maya, she could still afford to smile while Tatsuya’s eyes gradually lost their emotion.

“Yet, it is the truth. Because, Tatsuya-san.”



“You are my son after all.”



The impact of this statement, as expected, even Tatsuya would be at a loss for words.

“Tatsuya-san, you are from the artificial insemination of my egg that had been frozen before ‘that incident’, you were born from my sister who is the surrogate mother of my son. Your father, of course, is not Tatsurou-san either. That’s why, Miyuki-san is your cousin.”



——Impossible.

After Tatsuya regained control of his mind, the first words which floated in his mind were these.



——It’s impossible for Miyuki to be my cousin.



——It’s impossible for Miyuki not to be my real sister.



Tatsuya was ashamed, that he was doubtful about the understanding.

Of course, he didn’t voice out the thought from his heart, he wouldn’t be careless enough to do so.

“…Would you mind telling me the details later?”

Maya accepted Tatsuya’s proposal, completely in her usual tone.

“You’re right. It’s hard to suddenly convince you even after I said all this, let’s have a nice parent-child talk by ourselves after this.”

Maya turned her eyes to Miyuki after she answered Tatsuya with a nod.

“Then, about our earlier talk… Miyuki-san, I’m sorry but as the next head of the Yotsuba Family, you have to give up on your free love choice.”

“Yes.”

Although Miyuki’s expression was stiff, yet the voice of hope, “Perhaps?”, had slipped from her. The reason why she clenched her hands at the back of her knees was not to prepare for the grief, but not to jerk when the likely delight in her premonition of convenience came into reality.

“Tomorrow, I will announce who your fiancé is at the same time as the next family head nomination, your partner is.”

Miyuki gasped a little. Even though it was only “a little”, she had almost stopped breathing.

“Tatsuya-san.”

Miyuki placed her hands in front of her mouth.

Those hands were visibly trembling.

Somehow, Miyuki restrained her scream by moving her hands that were blocking her mouth to her chest.

She held them both on top of her heart, and blinked tightly before looking down as if embracing her body to withstand the pain.

Miyuki was experiencing a “my chest was about to break apart” in reality now moment.

However, it was in joy rather than sorrow. She rejoiced too strong, that it was similar to a strong pain.

She was so happy, so happy, that she needed to calm her body which was in a heightened state of excitement like a madman somehow, Miyuki looked up.

Her eyes were filled with tears, she had an expression of being ready to cry.

Maya took the blame after seeing such a distraught Miyuki.

“Tatsuya-san, please attend tomorrow’s Gathering as you will be named as Miyuki’s fiancé. This is all I want to talk about.”

Miyuki lowered her head deeply, her hands were aligned to her knees, and tears started to drip.

“Miyuki-san, tomorrow is the recital for your engagement. It’s a great stage for you, please prepare and polish yourself well tonight.”

“I’m thankful for your heartfelt thoughts…”

The sound of sobbing and her tremors were reduced, Miyuki answered Maya while her head was still lowered. Maya’s figure was like an affectionate mother, wearing a permissive expression——however, a disproportionate cold light could be seen in her eyes——a stare.

“Hayama-san.”

“Yes, madam.”

Hayama showed up immediately at her call.

By the time he appeared, Tatsuya had wiped Miyuki’s tears with a handkerchief.

“Please call Minami-chan. Let her make some arrangements for Miyuki san’s bath.”

“Understood.”

Minami came immediately.

Maya gave a direct order to Minami, she dictated that she be snappy.

“Minami-chan, take Miyuki to her room. Then, please call her out when you have prepared the bath, guide her way.”

“Understood.”

Minami led Miyuki to the guest room.

Maya faced Tatsuya.

“Should we move to a new place?”

“Yes.”

Maya rose.

Hayama opened the door.

Tatsuya followed after Maya.

Hayama reverently bowed to Tatsuya. It was the biggest change he had seen thus far in this place.




They were heading to Maya’s study. It was Tatsuya’s first time to entering this room. No, there had never been anyone else who had ever stepped into this room besides Maya and Hayama, except for a few furniture maintenance technicians and a HAR. It could be said that Tatsuya was the second person she had ever allowed to enter this room.

Inside the room, there was a huge desk with a high chair with a backrest, a bookshelf as high as the ceiling, and a vintage reception set.

Hayama recommended to Tatsuya that he sit down on the sofa. Maya sat opposite of him, and asked Tatsuya with a voice that a parent would have about why he was looking around the room.

“Tatsuya-san, what are you looking at?”

“Excuse me. I just realized that the room where you always call Miyuki from isn’t your study.”

“You take notice about strange things.”

Maya’s laughter was glazed like a young girls.

“This is completely my private space. Even the HAR is a stand-alone unit.”

“A completely offline environment.”

“Yes.”

Maya’s answer wasn’t true. This room was equipped with a single network. However, it wasn’t a complete lie either, because that line was only operating from a specific device to deliver its search key data, completely independent of other devices, half of what she said was a true.

“Tatsuya-sama, do you mind having black coffee?”

Tatsuya could never remember an instance where Hayama called him with “-sama”. He mustn’t mind such a thing now.

“Yes, black please.”

Tatsuya answered him with as natural a tone as possible.

He placed a coffee in front of Tatsuya and a herbal tea before Maya.

Tatsuya had a little concern whether the smell of coffee would cancel the scent of the herb tea, but he didn’t particularly say anything as he wasn’t worried about it. He waited for Maya to put the cup to her mouth, before taking a sip of his coffee.

The coffee, much to Tatsuya’s regret, was more delicious than Miyuki’s coffee.

“It’s delicious… Although this might sound rude, but as expected of Hayama-san.”

“I’m honored by your compliment, Tatsuya-sama. I have a little trick up my sleeve.”

“Trick, is it?”

“Yes. It’s a shame, but I did it with a little help of magic.”

Maya revealed a happy voice in her surprise that he was willing to reveal that to Tatsuya.

“To be able to use such a delicate magic, even I am no match for Hayama-san. Truly, such a way of using magic is important.”

“No, it’s not something to exaggerate about. I’m just simply doing what I can according to my abilities.”

Hayama’s remark had invited Tatsuya into deep thought. However, Tatsuya cut off that temptation and turned his attention to Maya.

Maya as well, must have been waiting to discuss the main issue. She placed her cup on the saucer, and gazed at Tatsuya’s eyes.

“Well then… I wonder what should we start with?”

“Before that, do you mind?”

Tatsuya halted the conversation.

Maya seemed to know what he was expecting.

“Oh, what is it?”

Maya used one of her hands to cover her mouth, she showed a light surprised look in her eyes. However, she was not seriously playing dumb. The evidence she couldn’t hide anything was that the ends of her lips were slightly indented upward. Though it didn’t mean that Maya had a big mouth. However, she purposely smiled right before she hid her mouth with her hand.

“Why did you tell such a lie!”

Tatsuya narrowed his eyes, not because he was amazed by Maya’s attitude and childishness.

However, the nature of his eyes was already sharp.

“A lie?”

Maya’s tone was fakely naïve, but Tatsuya didn’t show any anger or frustration.

However he didn’t allow any more spurious, so he put on the sharp look.

“The lie that Miyuki is not my real sister.”

Tatsuya declared so with a tone that might be expressed as rather gentle. He felt that there was no need to raise his voice, what he was stating was just a fact.

“No, it wasn’t a lie.”

However, Maya denied that fact.

She denied it with a gentle tone, similar to Tatsuya’s.

Tatsuya couldn’t understand why Maya was so confident, this was reflected in his stare upon the face of his aunt.

Maya sipped her herbal tea leisurely.

“You said that there is a mountain of evidence that the both of you are real siblings, but can you really call it evidence?”

She put down her cup and gazed at Tatsuya’s eyes with an up-from under look. Maya asked several questions while retaining that posture. Maya didn’t laugh out loud, but smiled with a joyful smile. A delightful light was dancing flashily around her eyes.

“Family registration? We don’t really care about such things, do we? DNA make up? That’s also a result that the hospital sent right? It’s not like Tatsuya-san’s own examination.”

Maya’s lips were a distorted clean crescent-shape.

“The Heads of the Branch Families only knew about Nee-san’s pregnancy. Even they didn’t know about anything that happened before her pregnancy, you know?”

Maya’s words stirred up his suspicion. Even for Tatsuya, it was irrefutable.

“Oba-ue.”

However, Tatsuya’s voice wasn’t upset.

The unwavering voice struck Maya like a liquid iron, which erased the smile on her face.

“Who do you think I am?”

This time, it was Tatsuya’s turn to stare at Maya in silence.

“I can recognize the structure and components of material; it is one of my abilities to decompose the material into any phase of configuration. I can recognize the substance of components as well, it also means that I know about the base substances which make up something.”

“I thought your information analysis is limited to 24 hours of retrospective in time.”

“The information of the components is currently located in the present. There isn’t any need for retrospective in time.”

Maya’s and Hayama’s expressions were consistent in showing that they didn’t expect the “unexpected”, but their feelings were based on different reason. Maya wore a “damn…” face, while Hayama’s shock was only a simple shock shown on his face.

“That’s why I know. Miyuki and I have the exact same element in our bodies. I can clearly see that both of our bodies were formed by the same source of sperm from the same man and eggs from the same woman.”

“Oh my…”

Maya’s tone was one of saying “I surrender”.

“You are really set apart from other people.”

“I’m afraid so.”

“I don’t mean to praise you though…”

Maya smiled with a hint of embarrassment, she dropped her eyes to the tea cup. Yet, she didn’t reach out for the cup, and returned her gaze to Tatsuya by raising her face.



“Very well. I’ll admit it.”



“Certainly, the thing I’ve said just now was a lie.

You were not born from my egg, but you are truly Nee-san’s child.”

…Tatsuya sighed lightly at the unapologetic confession from Maya.

“Then why did you say such a thing?”

“However, it wasn’t completely wrong that you and Miyuki aren’t real siblings.”

Although Maya’s words didn’t answer Tatsuya’s question, Tatsuya also didn’t miss a single word. He was as calm as can be when waiting for the continuation of Maya’s explanation.

“Because, Miyuki-san has a modified body.”

Tatsuya opened his eyes widely. He stopped breathing and couldn’t speak a word immediately.

“…Miyuki was genetically engineered? But there are no signs.”

“Yet, it’s the truth. Miyuki-san was made to nullify the distortion, to stabilize the instability, she can be said to have a ‘perfect modified body’, the Masterpiece of the Yotsuba.”

“Why…”

“Why did we make Miyuki-san? It’s for you, Tatsuya-san.”

Tatsuya was completely speechless. It was probably impossible, but had his heart received more of a shock, his consciousness would probably be bleached.

“Your power is something that mustn’t be allowed to be activated in an outburst in any circumstances. Although it’s a perfect strength for the case of an emergency, it must be stopped before it deprives you from having a life. It was possible for Nee-san to do so. Her Mental Structure Interference can force her way to interfere with the unconscious area of the opponent by closing their ‘Gate’ temporarily. However, Nee-san would die before you for sure. That’s why, it was necessary to create a magician who would always be at your side, Miyuki was created to stop you.”

Maya had a serious look so much that it was scary, she stared at Tatsuya’s eyes.

“Miyuki has a modified body who was created in order to stop you.”

“Miyuki, for me? Not me, for Miyuki?”

Tatsuya was dazzlingly stunned. He wasn’t even aware of the irrationality in his own words.

“That’s right. Miyuki-san was a girl born only for you.”

Maya softened her look and tone.

“In the first place, how could someone be born to be so beautiful naturally? With such a perfect appearance, completely symmetrical body, there’s no way someone like that is born naturally.”

Perhaps, Maya noticed the jealousy mixed in her voice, she wore an uncomfortable smile.

“Although I don’t think that we could successfully recreate a childlike Miyuki-san even if we were to repeat the same procedure that made her. In that sense, she exceeds the nature of humans, perhaps, even a Godlike miraculous beauty.

“Does Miyuki know about this?”

Maya shook her head while smiling mercifully to Tatsuya’s question.

“No. I don’t want to let Miyuki-san know, and not a single Head of the Branch Families know either. The only ones who know about this are the late previous family head, Eisaku-ojisama, my late Nee-san, me, Hayama-san, and the former head who oversaw the modifying facility, Kurebayashi-san and his few of confidants… Hey, Tatsuya-san.”

Maya tried to fix Tatsuya’s mood, she talked to him with a sweet voice.

“The bond between you and Miyuki-san is stronger than that of a parent and child, strictly speaking from a genetic point of view, the genetic relationship between you and me is much closer than you and Miyuki san.”

Maya graced Tatsuya saying such words with a sweet voice.

“Moreover, the fact that you are my son might not be a complete fault.”

“But.”

Tatsuya’s rebuttal was interrupted by a honey like voice that seemed to wrap around him.

“Certainly, we are nephew and aunt genetically. But spiritually speaking, you are my son, Tatsuya-san.”

“Spiritually?”

Tatsuya couldn’t understand Maya’s words, so he decided to listen further in silence.

“Originally, all of Oji-sama’s and also Mitsugu’s generation were disappointed and feared your power. However, I was happy. I was cheering to the point that I wanted to dance out of joy. Because, your magic is the key that can fulfill my wish.”

She was probably recalling that time, Maya looked like she was about to tremble, she had a floating ecstatic expression.

“Your magic, is the star of death that will change the world. I can retaliate against the world. The world which took my past and my future, and tore away my modest happiness as a woman in a cruel way.”

The sweetness in Maya’s voice, had been contaminated with a curse, her grudge against the world.

“That’s why, it wasn’t a lie when I said I’m your mother. Because, the one who wished for your birth wasn’t Nee-san. You were born to this world by my desire. Mitsugu-san and the others were mistaken about that. The one who wished for the world’s destruction is me, it’s my prayer. You were born to answer my feelings. You’re biologically Nee-san’s son, but the one who wished for you to be the way you are as a magician, was me. That’s why, as a magician, you are my son.”

“However, Oba-ue isn’t supposed to be able to use Mental Interference Magic.”

The words of objection barely slipped from Tatsuya, which also weren’t able to halt Maya.

“Yes, you’re right. That’s why it was a miracle. My strong wish had overturned magic and caused an out of place event. Perhaps, due to the fact that we’re twins. Nee-san is my twin after all, perhaps, her magic was moved due to my will. The feelings for my sister’s son, as my strong prayer was dedicated to you, I wonder if Nee-san’s magic realized about my wish.”

Maya spoke enthusiastically. No, she was feverish.

“Nee-san knew that. That the magic of her baby, had been quietly taken over by me. Nee-san had deprived me from myself, and I deprived her son from her. What terrible sisters.”

She wasn’t snorting, but voicing out with a passionate and sweet voice.

“Even so, Nee-san had tried to love you. Although in the end, she wasn’t able to love you, do you know how much effort she put in?”

While trying to explain about Miya to Tatsuya, Maya’s voice didn’t hide that she was ridiculing her sister.

“The Artificial Magician Experiment, was to keep your magic in check from running out of control because of an outburst from an emotional influence. That was the true purpose. So you are in a real sense, an experimental material without an experiment body, you weren’t just a sample. Although Nee-san had been reluctant right until the end, in the end, you might become a destroyer of the world, massacre of humanity, she subjected you to this, in order to prevent you from becoming satan. In order to only take your strong feelings, it took everything out of Nee-san. Actually, it was much simpler to blot out all of your emotions, the burden on Nee-san would’ve also been much smaller. Nee-san knew that it would shorten her own life, but she still carefully modified your mind.

The mind that had been twisted by me before you were born, Nee-san didn’t try to run away, but to modify you.”

Maya’s talk was halted; it was due to the fact that she was out of breath.

She didn’t even drink her tea, before resuming her story.

“In order for Miyuki-san to be able to stop you indiscriminately, Nee-san tried to train her to be indifferent of you. Without interest, there wouldn’t be any hatred. And there was nothing to turn into pain. She didn’t want to stop your outbursts due to overwhelming emotion with ‘Cocytus’, and there was no guarantee that you’d be stopped either.”

There was such a deep thought behind the indifferent attitude of his mother, this was hard to believe all of a sudden. Perhaps if not Tatsuya, no one else would believe it either.

“It was for the same reason that Miyuki was educated thoroughly as a lady. So that her magic wouldn’t be based on her emotions. Always under control like a lady, and never to cause a hysteria like baring her feelings, she was shaped to grow into such a girl. I’d like to say that it has been completely successful, but in the first place, there’s no such thing as a perfect lady anyway.”

“…Miyuki is a perfect lady. My sister’s magic tends to run wild due to the effect of ‘Pledge’.”

“Oh my.”

Maya was spouting “pfft”.

“You siblings really have a good relationship. Seems like you’d do good as her fiancé from here onwards.”

“Regardless of any psychological or physical connection, it is unquestionable that we are real siblings. Therefore, it’s impossible for us to be a couple right?”

“Why?”

“Even if you ask why…”

It was too obvious, Tatsuya failed to mention the reason immediately.

“In case you’re groundlessly concerned about your future children to be born with genetic abnormalities. Like I said earlier, Miyuki-san was brought together to have the best ‘perfect modified body’ from the technology of the Yotsuba. She not only was genetically engineered, but also thoroughly mentally adjusted by Mental Interference Magic. That child can overcome all the defects of a modified body, a Masterpiece of the Yotsuba which was completed in a human being and brought her to the next level. She is different from the failure of the Kudou Family.

Children born between you and Miyuki won’t have any defects. I guarantee that in the name of the Yotsuba. There isn’t a single gene in her that can lead to any abnormalities.”

“But…”

“I’m sure that she won’t even mind that she has a modified body. Perhaps, she would even rejoice over that fact. By modification, she will figure out that your body and her body’s genetic relation is quite far apart. That she is biologically connected to you is something inevitable after all.”

What Maya said might be correct. At the very least, Tatsuya couldn’t point out any mistakes, to tell the truth, Tatsuya already had an idea about this.





Miyuki’s body was undeniable, it came from the same cell components of the same parents as Tatsuya.

However, there were also certain mixed elements that he couldn’t explain.

Tatsuya understood that they didn’t cause harmful bodily effects to Miyuki’s body. Hence, he was thinking of those factors as natural mutation products. However, considering that they were brought about by modification, the large differences between him and Miyuki’s “components” could be a more rational interpretation. He couldn’t help to admit so unwillingly.

“Tatsuya-san. You can tell Miyuki-san about this. That Miyuki-san has a modified body made for you, and also the fact that she physically and mentally doesn’t carry any factor that can cause disabilities at all. At the very least, there won’t be any problems physically for you and Miyuki-san to marry each other.”

Tatsuya stared at Maya’s face.

Maya also, returned a stare in silence.

“…Understood. Certainly, this is not something to be hidden from her.”

Tatsuya nodded after hesitating for quite a significant amount of time.

“That’s right. If you leave it as is, Miyuki-san will get worried.”

Even though Maya’s words were intended as a joke, Tatsuya couldn’t deny them.

“Please cherish Miyuki-san.”

Suddenly, Maya changed her tone.

“When you lose Miyuki, you’ll break apart. Your mind was designed to be that way. And when you break, you can burn the world.”

It was a prophecy, no, it was the tone of a prophecy.

“That’s why, please protect and cherish Miyuki-san with your hand for life.”

After that, Maya told her true feelings.

“Actually, I don’t really care either way.”

Within her eyes, the most intense light in the night could be seen.

“That time, when you destroy the world, the revenge of my heart will be completed.”

The hottest, flame of passion was lit.

“If you are able to protect Miyuki from the malice of the world, my revenge would take on another form. It is the revenge of a person who yielded against the world that trampled on the fate of people with arrogance.”

The name of that flame was madness.

“I’m sure I would be able to forget that scoffed ungraceful appearance that I received from the unfairness of the world.”

In the midst of her flame of madness, Maya put on an innocent smile.

“What a lovely thing that would be. What a wonderful son you are. You will fulfill my revenge. For ‘Yotsuba Maya’ who died at the age of 12.”

“Oba-ue. You’re crazy.”

“For that purpose, Tatsuya. You will marry Miyuki. I will not take any objections.”

Tatsuya’s words didn’t reach Maya’s consciousness. Even if she heard it, it failed to reach being recognized by Maya’s heart.

Hayama proceeded next to Maya, he replaced the herbal tea which had gone cold with a new one.

Maya directed her eyes to Tatsuya, with a drastic change, that not even a hint of madness was visible to Tatsuya.

“Tatsuya-san, do you want more coffee?”

“No, I’m fine.”

“Really? Ah, it’s already this late.”

The dinner was over at 9 P.M. Now, the hand of time was past 10 P.M. Tatsuya didn’t realize it by himself, but thinking about Maya’s explanation seemed to take an unexpectedly considerable amount of time.

“We have an agenda for tomorrow; we should end this soon. Tatsuya-san, do you still have anything to ask?”

“Then in the grace of your words, one last thing.”

Tatsuya was concerned that Maya’s madness might burn again, so he decided to ask about the things that he must know the answer to now.

“Oh, what is it?”

“Why did you choose tomorrow? Do you have any reason in announcing that I’m your son, that I will be announced as Miyuki’s fiancé?”

Certainly, the New Year’s Gathering is the meeting where everyone in the families are updated about the key condition of the Yotsuba. It was the most suitable to nominate Miyuki.

However, for Tatsuya, it was somewhat a weak reason for Maya to push all these things to be announced tomorrow as well.

“It’s not like we have to do it tomorrow, but I do have one reason.”

Contrary to Tatsuya’s concerns, Maya was calm, and she answered his question as if she was amused by something.

“Originally, I didn’t have any plan to announce you as my son at this year’s New Year’s Gathering. However, Tatsuya-san as well, you used such a flashy stunt.”

The one she referred as “flashy stunt” was him using Material Burst to annihilate the Great Asian Alliance Fleet, there was no need for Tatsuya to confirm this.

“And then, the USNA had moved their Joint Chief Staff which directly controls magician troops, they even ordered a curfew for their investigation, you were that attention-grabber.”

“I’m sorry for that.”

Tatsuya involuntarily smiled wryly. He didn’t think that “whether there was a meaning for such confinement instruction”. At least for Tatsuya, it only looked like an afterthought of a reason.

“It’s good that it has passed.”

Maya nodded lightly. Even when her madness was hidden in the shadows, her familiarity to Tatsuya remained.

“But, even after the Stars withdrew from Japan, and Kudou-sensei went mad, or even the overseas Chinese Houjutsu user, you have been involved in various behind the scene jobs.”

The Kudou Family went mad, would be a comment for Parasite Dolls. The overseas Chinese Houjutsu user was Zhou Gongjin.

After hearing that, Tatsuya thought, “Certainly, many things happened this year”. Putting aside Maya’s convenience, Tatsuya certainly had no intention in being involved in a fight with the Yotsuba.

“That’s why, in the end, your debut is brought up to the New Year’s Gathering tomorrow.”

“So that’s the case.”

Tatsuya, for once, showed an understanding. At the very least, he found out that there was an opportunity and a need to spread the lie that he was Maya’s son during the Gathering tomorrow.

——However, that also didn’t mean anything.

“Then, this is the end of my explanation for real.”

Maya showed a satisfied smile. This discussion seemed to end with her being satisfied. At the very least, she managed to convince Tatsuya to a certain degree after all.

“Tatsuya-san, do you know where your room is?”

“I’m alright, Oba-ue.”

“Really?”

Maya didn’t seem to mind when Tatsuya returned to his old way of addressing her.

“Then sorry for not able to assist you, do you mind going back to your room alone? You can call someone along the way to help prepare the bath immediately before you reach your room.”

“Understood.”

Tatsuya understood firmly that this was the end of their conversation.

“Thanks for the coffee, it was delicious.”

Tatsuya bowed to Maya and Hayama, and left the study.




Even after Tatsuya left, Maya had remained on the couch.

“Madam, thank you for your hard work.”

Hayama said so to Maya from behind.

“Somehow, I became more emotional than I had planned.”

Maya reluctantly said so. For her, it was probably an apology for the previous one-act, her outburst of excitement.

“Since you were retelling that story, I think it couldn’t be helped.”

Hayama defended Maya with “It was a topic where you couldn’t avoid such excitement”, perhaps, that was embarrassing for her, Maya turned her face away with an “hmph” expression which didn’t suit her age.

Even Hayama thought that it was funny, but he was not so careless as to show a smile on his face.

“So that was madam’s secret plan all along. This time, even I must accept that I have nothing but admiration.”

Last November, she immediately made a call for Tatsuya and Miyuki to come to the Manor right after the Yokohama Incident, Maya told Hayama “Miyuki must become the next family head to bind Tatsuya. I have some consideration in subjecting her to the family head seat”. She confided her plans to Hayama about the preparations for the New Year’s Gathering, which takes place tomorrow.

“Thanks to the variety of things that happened out of expectation, I got excited more than I thought. The rest depends on how far Miyuki-san, can go.”

“Whether she will become a great woman.”

The surprising remark came from none other than Hayama with a firm tone, Maya looked back at Hayama by twisting her body on the sofa.

Hayama displayed a good natured old-man smile.

“Both Miyuki-sama and Tatsuya-sama have to face their future feelings properly. Although Tatsuya-sama is heading into a place without an enemy, he faces Miyuki-sama’s feeling straightforwardly without failure.”

“To honestly love would be my folly, I’d say.”

“In this case, it’s the one who is honest who wins.”

Hayama’s laugh and smile pulled Maya out from her own miasma.




When Tatsuya returned, there wasn’t anyone in the room. Miyuki must have been brought to the same home estate for tomorrow’s preparations. As Maya said, the guide for the bath came pretty soon. It was rare for him to stay overnight at the Main House, the bath was also quite different as it was his first time staying in a Japanese-style guest room.

He didn’t dress unsightly for the round trip to the bath as it was possible to run into someone. Tatsuya’s bathing time was neither long, nor short. When he returned to his room, the clock was already pointing to 11 P.M., yet Miyuki hadn’t returned.

Instead, he found out that the futon was already set.

In series to the Japanese-style room, a set of futon for pair, with two pillows.

“Onii-sama, sorry for making you wait.”

Miyuki returned at such a bad moment.

“This is…”

While leaving the sliding door open, she looked at the state of the next room. If she looked into the room, it was natural to focus her eyes on…

“Miyuki, this isn’t my do-…”

-ing, Tatsuya was not able to continue his excuse until the end. Perhaps, Miyuki was polished by a lot of servants until she shone, she was also only wearing underwear under her Hitoe. The bathroom was possibly very hot, as she didn’t appear to be cold to wear so little despite it being mid-winter. The current blushed in her face and neck might appear to be caused by the heat, but it was obvious that the room temperature wasn’t hot.

The reason for his loss of words wasn’t due to the Hitoe. It was because of the strong charm of Miyuki cladded in that Hitoe, he somehow lost the time to explain and drifted to his speechlessness.

She already had a beautiful look, but now it seemed that she was actually shining.

Miyuki had the air of a refreshing inanimate scent, now she might actually attract not only butterflies and bees, she was wearing a subtle scent of a flower.

If she walked in Tokyo through a crowd as she was, there would be undoubtedly imminent large panic among the crowd.

Tatsuya without exaggerating thought so.

“Onii-sama, this is…”

However, Miyuki was also in a not-so-calm state, and it was exaggerated with only one futon set out, those were the first words she emitted after she reboot her mind.

“No, this isn’t my doing. It was already in this condition when I returned from the bath.”

“I see.”

Since he thought that he was restless with much standing. Tatsuya sat in front of the low table, Miyuki was also seated in front of the futon. As the sliding door leading to the next room, they felt conscious when it opened, yet felt strange to close it.

In front of Tatsuya, Miyuki seemed to be unable to calm down while combing her hair. Somehow, she was conscious of his gaze.

It couldn’t be helped. It hadn’t even been three hours since the shocking declaration that Tatsuya was to be Miyuki’s fiancé. Taking into account, the bombshell that Tatsuya and Miyuki were not real siblings. It was unreasonable not to be conscious of each other right now.”

“Umm, O-onii-sama.”

Hesitation was felt in Miyuki’s tone.

Tatsuya raised his eyebrows in wonder.

“What is it?”

“No, that… Onii-sama, can I still call you that? Or should I call you Ta—”

“I don’t mind if you call me as usual.”

As Miyuki didn’t seem to be able to call him “Tatsuya”, Tatsuya rescued her with a laugh.

Miyuki smiled with a relieved face. However, his answer of “As usual” wasn’t only for Miyuki. Tatsuya wasn’t going to keep up with the lie of “Miyuki isn’t my sister”.

“Then, Onii-sama… Have you already finished your discussion with Oba-ue?”

“Such a thing…”

The fact that I was here, such a thing was a given right, he was about to answer, but he soon realized that Miyuki’s question had a different meaning.

“Yes, it’s concluded. I have asked everything that I needed to know about from Oba-ue herself.”

“I see. Then, about that…”

Miyuki was stammering. She was probably not hesitating. Just, hadn’t enough courage to ask about the matter.

She summoned up the courage which had been void from her heart, Miyuki was finally able to ask Tatsuya.

“About Onii-sama and me not being real siblings.”

——Is it true?

However, no matter how much courage she summoned, she wasn’t able to say the decisive words from her mouth.

“A lie.”

Tatsuya’s answer was extremely brief.

Miyuki’s heart was torn in two from that answer.

The feeling of relief that she was Tatsuya’s sister, and that she wouldn’t be able to marry Tatsuya as his sister.

“Why… Why did Oba-sama tell such a lie?”

“This is an over simplification of an explanation, but it seems like it was done in order to let us marry.”

Maya’s explanation was difficult to understand for certain, but Tatsuya understood more circumstances than Miyuki. However, he was wondering to what extent that he should reveal to Miyuki, Tatsuya hadn’t really decided. “Even though we’re siblings?”

“Well, since the family registry and DNA analysis were just formalities.”

“Well… That’s true in light of the power that the Yotsuba Family has.”

“There’s no need to worry about genetic abnormalities of our future children either.”

“Why, is that so?”

Miyuki who was facing down in a gloomy face, raised her face and fixed her eyes at Tatsuya. The white skin above her neck wasn’t covered by the Hitoe, which made Tatsuya involuntarily want to look away. However, thinking so would mean that he was walking into Maya’s palm, so he regained the calmness in his mind.

With having regained control of his senses, Tatsuya stared at Miyuki’s eyes again.

Miyuki’s eyes looked as if she was ready to receive any kind of truth from him.

Maya had made the decision for Tatsuya to be Miyuki’s companion, she had thought that Miyuki could bear such a weight.

As he acknowledged the readiness on her eyes, Tatsuya firmed his decision on the part that he should tell to Miyuki.

“You are, your body has no factor that can cause any genetic abnormality.”



“You have, a modified body.”

Miyuki stared with watchful eyes while covering her mouth with both of her hands.

Her long hair was shaking.

Tatsuya was a little relieved that she didn’t show a frightened face.

“I have, a modified body…”

“You were made from Kaa-san’s and Oyaji’s fertilized egg, and with the Yotsuba’s science, was made to have a ‘perfect modified body’, thanks to the best technology. You overcame all of the defects which come from having a modified body, you are the Masterpiece of the Yotsuba which has been completed as a human being, or more than human being.”

Tatsuya’s explanation wasn’t supposed to be a consolation, the fact that she wasn’t a human who was born naturally. However, for some reason, Miyuki visibly regained her composure.

Miyuki was neither upset nor scared, from the fact that she is a human being who had been artificially created. Miyuki knew now that her body, and life, was a gift she received from Tatsuya. The more she thought about it, the more she was convinced that it was appropriate. That was why she didn’t worry too much that originally her body was artificially created and such.

“Then, I… As long as I’m by Onii-sama’s side, I won’t suddenly fall into the netherworld right?”

The one things she was worried about was the limitation of her life as a woman with a modified body. Fear that she suddenly had exhausted her own life and couldn’t be together with Tatsuya anymore.

“Judging from the way Oba-ue talked, it seems like your resistance to continuous magical use, is likely higher than my own.”

“It means that… I can live alongside you, Onii-sama?”

“Judging from the way Oba-ue talked, it seems like you will have a long life.”

In the end, after she was told that she could live as long as her brother, she didn’t even care that she has a modified body.

“Onii-sama and I are siblings, but my genes are different from Onii-sama’s.”

Tatsuya felt like saying “Hey…”.

Certainly, Maya said that Miyuki has a modified body, genetically speaking, it was true that the relationship between Tatsuya and Maya was only that of nephew and aunt. However, between Tatsuya and Miyuki, there wasn’t a single word that could deny their relationship. Yet, Miyuki was saying the same thing as Maya.

Similarities aren’t only brought about by genes… Tatsuya thought so.

“From the beginning, members of the Yotsuba Family were a human experimentation, with manipulated genes from the Fourth Laboratory.

Although, it was different than that of a modified body, it doesn’t change that we also have undergone genetic manipulation.”

The way Tatsuya said that, was to emphasize the similarity between Miyuki and him.

However, Miyuki with her sleepy face, didn’t seem to be able to digest these meanings well enough.

“Then, Onii-sama and I will be cousins from now on?”

“At least in the eyes of others.”

“Then, I can be engaged to Onii-sama, right!”

Miyuki raised her voice in excitement.

However, her excitement didn’t last very long. As she saw the confused look on Tatsuya.

“As expected, you must be disgusted…”

“With what?”

Tatsuya couldn’t figure out the reason why Miyuki was suddenly gloomy, he couldn’t even understand the meaning behind her dark voice.

“Because, to Onii-sama, I’m still your sister right?”

“Yes, because that’s a fact.”

For now, that fact was undeniable to Tatsuya.

“For a sister to want to be the bride of her own real brother, it is still abnormal right…”

“Miyuki, do you.”

For a moment, Tatsuya thought that he heard wrongly. However, his five sense had been honed to a level beyond an ordinary person with training.

Miyuki definitely said “For a sister to want to be the bride of her own real brother”. From the context, it could only be interpreted to be Miyuki and Tatsuya.

In other words, Miyuki…

“Ye-yes! It was not due to Oba-sama’s order only! I’m very happy to hear that i will be Onii-sama’s fiancé!”

Miyuki looked down while clasping her hands on her thighs. Her tears were falling on top of her hands, onto her thighs.

“Even now, that feeling hasn’t changed. Even though I know that Onii-sama is my real brother, I want Onii-sama to treasure me as a woman! I want to be Onii-sama’s bride! When I said I had given up, suddenly I didn’t want to give up!”

Miyuki’s voice wasn’t difficult to hear even if she was excited. However there were some things that were difficult to understand due to her excitement.

What she said about “When I said I had given up, suddenly I didn’t want to give up”, must be “I’d given up until I’d heard the story, now that you said we can get married, I don’t need to give up anymore”. Tatsuya had no clue at all that what Miyuki was worrying about were the things from earlier, that it surprised him. Certainly, Miyuki had shown an excessive amount of attention to him as her real brother. However, Tatsuya always thought that she was yearning for him only as a brother.

However, it might be because he, himself, only wanted to think only thus far.

Against Miyuki’s tears, Tatsuya had a suspicion that he was tamed by such things.

“But, Onii-sama is normal after all… You have a normal sense of moral too… You wouldn’t carry a romantic feelings for your own sister right. You must have been disgusted by such an abnormal sister like me…”

Miyuki finally sobbed.

It wasn’t a loud cry, but one that made the listener have a tight painful chest, she suppressed her sorrow so much that her cry was concentrated in the last minute.

“Miyuki…”

Tatsuya stretched a hand toward Miyuki timidly.

Miyuki extended her hand to catch Tatsuya’s hand.

Tatsuya thought that she would shake his hand. He thought it was natural to deal with him so, as he was the heartless big brother who didn’t notice his sister’s problem to the point that she cried in pain. However, Miyuki grabbed Tatsuya’s right hand with both of her hands. Then, she hugged it in her chest.

“O…”

Tatsuya tried to restrain her and say “Hey, wait”, but he stopped. He couldn’t bring himself to say something that would refuse Miyuki too bluntly now. No, he didn’t want to do so.

“Onii-sama, I, I…”

While grabbing his hand strongly, Miyuki desperately mustered her words out.

Mustering out her own feelings.

“Love, you. I love you. I’m in love with Onii-sama!”

The words Tatsuya always heard from his sister was “I adore you”. It was his first time hearing “I love you” from her.

Only a one-character difference, could change the weight of the words this much. Tatsuya only noticed this for the first time.

“It’s fine even if you want to hate me for being such an abnormal sister!

It’s fine even if you consider that these bad feelings are an unnatural tendency! But…, please. I beg you Onii-sama…”

Miyuki raised her face, wet with tears.

Tatsuya had never seen such a sorrowful, such a desperate face, yet so beautiful.

“Somehow… Somehow… Please let me be by your side. Please don’t be detached from me. Please don’t disappear from my side!”

Even when she was crying, Miyuki didn’t distort her face. It was her beautiful face, with showering tears.

Today was the first time he knew this as well.

Her sad crying face, Tatsuya thought.

While still entrusting his right hand to Miyuki, Tatsuya reached out with his left hand to Miyuki’s back.

“O-onii,-sama…?”

“I won’t disappear from your side.”

“Ah… Umm… Onii-sama, once more… One more time…”

Miyuki asked so fearfully while being held with Tatsuya’s hand, in Tatsuya’s arm, and pressing her face to Tatsuya’s chest. She wanted to hear those words again to affirm it.

“Miyuki. I won’t disappear from your side.”

“Ah…”

Miyuki was overcome with her emotion, while all her energy was escaping from her body.

Tatsuya thought that he must answer his sister who entrusted all of her body to him.



“Until death do us part. I will be by your side.

Although, it might not be in the sense that you desire.

I still, can only see you as my sister.

You’re my cute little sister. I won’t think badly of such a cute little sister.

I also don’t think that you’re abnormal.

I will never reject you. I won’t detach myself from you.

However, Miyuki… That’s because I’m your brother. And because you’re my cute little sister.

That’s why… Sorry. At the very least, I can only see you as my sister for now.”



Miyuki, who was still held by Tatsuya’s arms, got up after she heard his answer and released Tatsuya’s right hand which she had been grabbed by and stuck it to her chest.

“That’s fine.”

There were traces of tears in Miyuki’s face. However, there were no new tears flowing out.

“I’m satisfied for now.”

Miyuki casually turned her hand to Tatsuya’s neck, and embraced him.

“Because, I also can only call you Onii-sama for now.”

Miyuki put her cheek beside Tatsuya’s cheek, while whispering in his ear.

“For Onii-sama to say ‘for now’ to my confession. It’s sufficient enough for me.”





Miyuki hugged Tatsuya with a strengthened force in her arms.

“Onii-sama, is it ok for me to hope? Not for ‘now’ but for ‘sometime’. For Onii-sama to be able to see me as ‘Miyuki’, and not your sister.” Tatsuya also whispered into Miyuki’s ear in the same way.

“This might sound strange, but I’ll try my best.”

Miyuki released her embrace.

“Oh, dear, Onii-sama.”

Miyuki laughed with an amazed face.

Tatsuya smiled wryly.

It was finally returning to the usual atmosphere of the siblings.

“Miyuki, it’s already late. We need to prepare early for tomorrow, let’s get some sleep.”

“Ah, that’s right. Then, I’ll ask for a futon.”

Miyuki was about to stand, but Tatsuya restrained her.

“Onii-sama?”

“There’s no need for that. Oba-ue has kindly set this up. Let’s just sleep in the same futon for today.”

“Ehh!?”

Miyuki’s voice was overturned. Her voice wasn’t so overturned even when she was crying.

“U, umm, Onii-sama, is that, do you mean.”

“No, you’re wrong.”

Tatsuya smirked wickedly at Miyuki.

“We’ll just sleep together. We won’t do anything else.”

“I… I see.”

Miyuki patted down her chest. There seemed to be a little regret in that gesture, Tatsuya wondered if she was expecting something.

“I’ll change into pajamas first. You can get into the futon first.”

“No… I can wait for you for a short while. Let’s get into the futon together, Onii-sama.”

“Understood. I’ll be back soon.”

Tatsuya had confirmed that this room was equipped with yukata for sleepwear. He needn’t get lost, and quickly took off his clothes and wore the yukata on top of his trunks.

“Onii-sama, don’t you feel cold?”

Miyuki asked anxiously when Tatsuya was going to get into the futon.

“No, this it’s probably already warm enough.”

Tatsuya slipped into the futon, while signaling Miyuki.

Miyuki showed a slight hesitation before settling into using Tatsuya as an arm pillow.

“I wonder when it was. Once upon a time, when I was really young, I feel like, there was one instance when I was held in your arm.”

“It wasn’t such an old occurrence… It was on the day when Kaa-san’s funeral was over.”

“That’s… Right… That was so careless of me.”

Miyuki rested her body on Tatsuya.

To embrace Miyuki’s shoulder tightly, Tatsuya turned his other arm.

“Onii-sama.”

“What is it?”

“Did Onii-sama really not know?”

“Well.”

“About how much I’ve been suffering, that is.”

“Sorry.”

“It is especially true in recent time. Society encourages magicians to marry early. If I’m to shoulder the status of being a magician, at the very least, I should have chosen a fiancé, or have prepared one.”

“That’s right.”

“Since siblings cannot marry each other. So, with another man besides Onii-sama…”

“Miyuki.”

Tatsuya’s hand stroked Miyuki’s hair.

Miyuki’s body was trembling in tension, although she immediately released this tension. And left her body to Tatsuya.

“Just go to sleep.”

“Yes, Onii-sama.”

Miyuki entrusted her body and mind to Tatsuya, she fell asleep while listening to the distant sound of bells on New Year’s Eve.





Chapter 7




2097 A.D., New Year’s Day.

Both Tatsuya and Miyuki had been busy since they had awakened this morning.

Waking up early was no big deal since the two of them were both used to waking up early, but they were already fed up with being treated like Traditional Japanese Dress-up Dolls. Tatsuya was the same as always, and while Miyuki was capable of putting on her clothes by herself, neither of them have gotten used to having everything done for them even when it comes to changing clothes. Visibly showing that he did not wish to have his face puffed with powder, Tatsuya adamantly refused, but Miyuki could not help him. Well, it was not like he was going to have his face made all white like a stage actor; it helped that the application of the powder was only at the level of something for “Japanese clothes–version natural makeup.”

At any rate, after being played around with for a full hour, by the time they were released, they felt like going home as they were.

“Tatsuya-niisan.”

“Miyuki-oneesama.”

They were seated on the chairs in the anteroom——probably trying not to get creases on their clothes. Fumiya, who was in a haori hakama, and Ayako, wearing furisode——where they were discussing with the two while walking about despite the fair number of tall, four-legged chairs located in the anteroom, about whether preparations were finally over with.

“Tatsuya-niisan, Miyuki-san, Happy New Year.”

“Tatsuya-san, Miyuki-oneesama, Happy New Year.”

The two people were polite in their New Year greetings, Tatsuya and Miyuki also started.

“Fumiya, Ayako-chan, Happy New Year. No, I can’t call you Ayako-chan anymore right?”

“Tatsuya-san, please don’t tease me on New Year’s Day. It’s alright. I make a special permit only for Tatsuya-san to call me ‘Ayako-chan’.”

“Fufufu. Fumiya-kun, Ayako-san, Happy New Year.”

“Uwaa.”

The one who raised their voice was Fumiya.

“Miyuki-san, how should I put this… You look, extremely beautiful.”

“I give up. That’s not how you do it.”

Fumiya was amazed that Ayako showed no hint of rivalry on her face, he wondered if she had convinced herself in treating Miyuki differently today because she’s the protagonist.

“Anyway, Miyuki-oneesama, that’s a wonderful furisode. It’s as if I’m looking at a bride at a wedding.”

Miyuki was unable to answer with anything but a bitter smile, since she herself also thought the same as Ayako, that her dress could fit for a wedding dress.

“I also think that this is exaggerating, but… I was convinced that I needed to wear this today.”

“Oh dear.”

It was somewhat hard to judge whether that expression of shock by Ayako meant she was really shocked or she was really jealous.

“Madam Shirakawa must have thought that it is appropriate for us to wear the most formal attire because there will be the appointment of the next Family Head.”

The one who made such a remark, was Yuuka, who was standing in her furisode.

“Yuuka-san, Happy New Year. Thank you very much for yesterday.”

“Happy New Year, Tatsuya-san. Then, you’re very welcome. Please don’t mind about what happened yesterday.”

Yuuka said so with a friendliness while approaching the spot where the other four were standing.

They exchanged New Year greetings, and seated themselves after Yuuka’s proposal.

Even only with this many people gathered, the lobby seems to be a little cramped.

Then, as the room felt more and more cramped, the people who were not present yet had grown more and more—quite unnecessarily so— noticeable.

“Shibata-san, I wonder if he won’t be coming.”

The one who dared to raise the question, perhaps due to the fact that he was the youngest, was Fumiya.

“Looking at the time, he should have already arrived. Perhaps he would come together with his parents.”

Tatsuya answered Fumiya with his conjecture.

The clock hung on the wall to remind them that they would soon be summoned.

As if to support Tatsuya’s words, a housekeeper with a modest furisode came to summon them.

“Excuse me. I will be the one to guide you, I am Sakurai Minami.”

The guide was Minami. The reason she was wearing that furisode was probably to distinguish herself in her role as their guide.

“I probably have a lot of shortcomings, but I shall serve you to the best of my ability, I will be in your care.”

As Minami said, she did do her best. There were times when she was asking herself whether the others were just mistaken about her being a guide at the New Year’s Gathering or whether she was misinterpreting the traditional culture with slight anachronisms, so it might have been embarrassing for her.

“Firstly, Fumiya-sama and Ayako-sama, please let me guide you.”

Fumiya and Ayako stood and bid farewell to Tatsuya, Miyuki and Yuuka in such order.

Both of them followed Minami quietly as they matched their steps out of the lobby.

“By the way, Tatsuya-san, do you know about the entrance manner for the New Year’s Meeting?”

Yuuka asked him this question at this late hour, but Tatsuya honestly answered her.

“I heard we will be summoned by someone and then be guided to make an entrance.”

Upon hearing Tatsuya’s response, Yuuka’s face looked full of pity for him.

“Perhaps, Miyuki-san also doesn’t know?”

“Yes, that’s as much as I’ve heard.”

“Then… Please take a piece of advice from me.”

Tatsuya and Miyuki both turned to Yuuka with quizzical looks.



Yuuka said it with a serious atmosphere.

“Upon entering, you must absolutely not burst into laughter. Once you’re able to hold it back, please promptly take a seat while bowing.”

It was only a short time before Yuuka was taken to the room.

“Tatsuya-sama, Miyuki-sama, please follow me.”

Minami came back to the lobby to summon Tatsuya and Miyuki.

“Minami-chan, are you alright? You look a little tired.”

As Miyuki said, Minami seemed to look a little tired.

“Yes, I’m alright. Sorry for my impertinence, but would you mind if we walked a little faster.”

But, she probably would get some rest after she finished this duty.

Tatsuya thought that it would best to follow her lead in order to end Minami’s duty as soon as possible, Miyuki chose to follow his lead after being asked so by Minami.

“The next head family candidate, Shiba Miyuki-sama, followed by her older brother, Shiba Tatsuya-sama.”

Tatsuya felt his knees breaking when Minami made her proclamation.

When he looked to his side, Miyuki was also soothing her knees. Without a doubt, it would have been a shameful display had Yuuka not advised them.

The servants came to kneel low off the floor before the two simultaneously, meanwhile both Tatsuya and Miyuki found it increasingly more difficult to keep calm. Even then, Tatsuya and Miyuki knelt down in a noble manner, with Tatsuya behaving with a great pomp under the circumstances, and Miyuki with chastity and refinement, while taking her bow.

(Is this a test, how can we deal with this many formalities?) Tatsuya bowed while thinking over this matter.

Kneeling before the two, Minami whispered to them “Please take your seats”. After hearing that signal, Tatsuya and Miyuki raised their faces. The assembly went a little taken aback, and it was none other due to the beauty of Miyuki.

Guided by Minami, Tatsuya and Miyuki went to their seats.

There was a commotion for the second time.

Tatsuya and Miyuki were led to the seats next to Maya.

“Everyone, once again, Happy New Year to all of you.”

While declaring her proclamation, Maya who wore a splendorous black tomesode bountifully adorned with gold thread, despite the fact that she was not married; the commotion ended abruptly as the whole congregation said, “Happy New Year” in perfect chorus. Tatsuya and Miyuki also anticipated that, so they readied their voices without delay.

Maya looked around with a content look.

“Today, on top of the auspicious new year, I have another piece of good news to be delivered to everyone. This matter is something that has made my heart truly delighted.”

With that introduction, Maya first turned her eyes to Katsushige. Beside Katsushige, who was donning a haori hakama just like Tatsuya and the others, uncomfortably sat Kotona who was donning a furisode just like Miyuki and the others.

“Katsushige-san, the eldest son of the Shibata Family, and Kotona Tsutsumi have recently gotten engaged.”

Huge cheers roared. Tatsuya tried to pick for some whispers from the crowds. There were more people who said “as I’ve thought” or “finally” than people who said “really”.

“From here on, it probably won’t be just happy times, there will be a lots of things you will struggle with, but please wish the young couple bountiful blessings ahead.”

An ovation broke out from the assembly. However, Tatsuya wasn’t able to ignore how before that there were a lot of people who nodded in agreement when Maya said “A lots of things you will struggle with”.

“Next, I shall be announcing what everyone has been most concerned about.”

The assembly went silent as if someone threw water at them.

“Fufufu, it is as you have all thought.”

Maya smiled as if irritated.

Even so, there was neither a whisper nor a sound from the assembly.

Perhaps, she was satisfied with this reaction, or may be dissatisfied.

Keeping up her secretive smile, Maya presented the name of the next family head.

“I would like to entrust the position of family head to our Shiba Miyuki here.”

There was vigorous clapping amid the ovation. It was particularly loud among the Main House’s servants.

“Let’s leave the congratulating process for another time. This New Year’s Meeting isn’t the place to do such a formal matter after all.”

Laughter of agreement arose from the assembly. Tatsuya gazed upon the crowd, he saw blushed faces in the man from the assembly. Tatsuya realized with a little astonishment that people are out here drinking after all.

“And then, the final news. Miyuki, our next family head, welcomes on this occasion, my son, Shiba Tatsuya as her fiancée.”

Instead of applause, came a huge commotion. It was in no way whispering, it was exchanged conversations.

“Pardon me, Toushu-sama, but would you permit me to ask a question?”

The voice came from, Yuuka’s vicinity. The woman who wore a comfortable irotomesode, was Yuuka’s mother, the Tsukuba Family’s Head, Tsukuba Touka.

“Tsukuba-dono, what is it?”

Maya asked her with a calm questioning smile.

Touka asked her with a stiff expression bereft of calmness.

“You just said ‘my son’, but did I mishear that? As far as I remember, Tatsuya-san is the son of Miya-sama, Toushu-sama’s Onee-sama.”

“I see. This is a good opportunity, so I thought I’d introduce him as my son too. Shiba Tatsuya here, was born from my egg before that ‘Incident’, currently I’m acting as his adoptive mother in my sister’s, Miya’s, stead. I’ve asked for her permission beforehand, thereby, I introduce him as my son from now onwards.”

The commotion turned to silence. However, that was only for a moment.

“Toushu-sama.”

“Yes, Mitsugu-san. What is it?”

In this place, she ought to call the Branch House Family Head, as “Kuroba-dono”, but Maya dared to call him “Mitsugu-san” as she used to. Maya knew very well that it pressured Mitsugu.

“About the ‘welcome’ you’ve said just now…”

“Oh, that’s right. That was an expression that would attract some misunderstanding.”

In contrast to Mitsugu’s stiff expression, Maya hinted an almost mocking, light, deceptive smile.

“Tatsuya is just a second-year student at the First High School, so he will continue to live with the Shiba Family as he has always done. Be it as it may that he is engaged, I think it wouldn’t be moral for a male and a female high schooler to be cohabitating, but I am certain that no such indiscretion would be committed between Miyuki-san and Tatsuya-san.”

“However…”

As he was just about to detail his opposition, Mitsugu closed his mouth. He noticed Fumiya who sat beside him who had been repeatedly asking Ayako, “Nee-san, are you alright”.

“Ara, Ayako-san, are you alright? Do you feel uncomfortable.”

Maya spoke out earlier than Mitsugu.

Mitsugu was stunned out of guilt for his daughter.

“Yes… I’m fine.”

Despite her firm reply, Ayako didn’t seem so in the eyes of the spectator.

“Would someone please take Ayako-san to another room to rest?”

The one who responded to Maya’s clamor was Fumiya and Minami.

“I will lead the way.”

“Please let me accompany her.”

Minami bowed at the entrance of the hall, while Fumiya wrapped his arms around Ayako’s shoulder while pleading to Maya.

“Yes, please.”

Maya gave the order to Minami.

“Fumiya-san, you may be dismissed.”

Then, she turned to Fumiya while saying so.




“Nee-san, I’m coming in.”

Fumiya knocked on the door of the room where Ayako was lying on a bed, having removed her Furisode and changed to more comfortable clothing.

Minami, who had been attending to her, opened the door from the inside.

“Fumiya.”

“Nee-san, you can’t do this! Please get some sleep!”

Rushing up to Ayako confused, Fumiya put her to sleep as she tried to rise up from the bed.

“You’re exaggerating. It’s not like I’m sick.”

Ayako replied with a tired voice. However, she lied on her bed calmly even as she said that.

Not sick, Fumiya diverted his face at those words. However, he soon returned his eyes to Ayako who lied down on the bed calmly.

“Nee-san, umm… are you alright?”

“What… Fumiya, you understand right?”

Ayako smiled in a face that was about to cry.

“I wonder if it was due to the fact that we’re twins. In times like this, I can’t hide anything from you.”

Fumiya showed a similar expression as Ayako.

Even if they’re twins, they came from different zygotes, since they have different genders, even their features are also different. The very girly Ayako and androgynous Fumiya. Even if Fumiya wore the same clothes, make-up and hairstyle as Ayako, they wouldn’t be mistaken for each other. However, they endured their tearful smiles and now made the same facial expression.

“It can’t be expected, since we’re against Miyuki-san. After all, Miyuki-san is the closest person to Tatsuya-niisan”

Fumiya implied that there was nothing they could do but to give up on Tatsuya. Ayako didn’t respond to those words which implied that she liked Tatsuya.

“I never thought that Toushu-sama allied herself to Miyuki-san this much though.”

“That’s wrong, Fumiya.”

Fumiya thought that Maya announced her stunt, saying that Tatsuya was her son, for the sake of Miyuki. However, Ayako denied it as being “wrong” immediately.

“This is, for Tatsuya-san’s sake.”

“Nee-san?”

“This isn’t for Miyuki-oneesama. Toushu-sama is using Miyuki-oneesama in order to ensure Tatsuya-san’s freedom and place.”

“I wonder…”

Fumiya shyly received new strength from Ayako’s words. He had probably created scenarios, which Miyuki was unsuitably chosen as Tatsuya’s mate.

Ayako’s words seemed to have landed at the right place, Fumiya’s opportunity to know, finally disappeared.




Due to Ayako exiting the room, the unexpected declaration that Tatsuya was Maya’s son such as “is it true”, “if it were, why did she hide it until now”, which was the logical pursuit, was left unspoken and unanswered.

Since it was unanswered, it also signified that Tatsuya’s position as Maya’s son and Miyuki’s fiancée was also established.

Even so, it didn’t mean that they could change their attitudes instantly from viewing him as the “bastard” of the Yotsuba to “the Son of the current Family Head” and “the next Family Head’s fiancé”. Even if they tried as much as they could on the surface, their disparaged attitudes oozed out at Tatsuya in words and actions.

However, Tatsuya had no intention to blame them for it. Since they were at a banquet now, and more importantly, he knew well enough back that this was a farce. That was why he’d rather show compassion to the branch families’ members and the servants who couldn’t change their attitudes instantly.

However, there was one servant who showed a different attitude.

“Tatsuya-sama, Miyuki-sama, this time congratulations.”

Hayama, with his morning coat, bowed in prostration before Maya, in front of the two.

“Thank you.”

Miyuki only returned a graceful “thank you”, but Tatsuya replied to him with a “thank you, but please raise your head” since he felt bad from the exaggerated manners.

“I’m not familiar with Main Family’s inner workings and traditions. I will need a lot of guidance from Hayama-san in the future.”

In the end, it was only a play, but Tatsuya tried to follow along with an admirable verbal reply.

“I’m honored. Please ask about the things you are uncertain about to these old bones.”

However, Hayama seemed resistant to end the play.

“By the way, Tatsuya-sama, do you remember?”

Since they had no meeting regarding the script, he didn’t have the idea of the topic at all.

However, Tatsuya didn’t have to struggle to dig around his memory.

“I was told that you promised to show us your new magic at this New Year’s Meeting.”

As Hayama immediately told him the answer.

“New magic? Tatsuya, have you completed it?”

Maya who paid no heed to the play and continued her meal asked him. This was not acting, but a genuine curiosity, and it was a given that she would do so.

“Yes.”

Tatsuya successfully covered up the “yeah, well” reluctant attitude in the precarious situation. Since he was in that situation, he couldn’t bring himself to blame the employees.

“Really? Then, please let me see!”

Maya was ecstatic, like a little girl, forgetting her dignity as the Family Head.

Tatsuya was about to protest when he hinted at Hayama for something.

However, Hayama was smiling as if he was watching his grandchild, Maya, who had regressed and acted like a child.

“Onii-sama. Tatsuya-san, I also want to see.”

For some reason, Miyuki decided to piggyback in this ruckus.

It was a perfect coalition.

“I understand. Since we are all here, why don’t we leave our seats for a while.”

Tatsuya had no longer any option to refuse their request.

Tatsuya, still wearing his Haori Hakama, pointed his CAD to the yard outside the hall venue.

To his opposite, a wild boar encased in a cage was placed.

Tatsuya began his explanation in a loud voice toward the audience in the venue.

“This new magic, ‘Baryon Lance’, is a magic with a lethality towards biological targets. For this reason, the demonstration will get a little bloody. If you are uninterested in any unnecessary killing, I propose for you to move to a separate room to relax for a while at your discretion.”

There were several people who withheld their face, yet not even one moved from their seat. The whole audience in this venue, after all, are people who were related to the Yotsuba.

“Then, I’ll start.”

Tatsuya took out the Silver Horn Custom, “Trident”, which had been modified for this magic from the case, while wondering why he needed to show it like a juvenile freak show.

The pistol which usually used as a dual-style, but this magic only needed the right hand side of Trident, and further to the tip, there was a sword attached. It was pretty long, like a bayonet, which made the overall appearance of Trident rather unbalanced.

Tatsuya turned the tip of the bayonet at the wild boar in the cage.

He drew the trigger as it was casually.

The magic processes started all at once, running in an instant.



[Material-Baryon Decomposition]

——Nucleus of the sword tip is decomposed. To decompose a nucleus, the molecule atom is decomposed into electrons and atomic nuclei, then the protons and neutrons in the nuclei are decoupled as baryons.



[FAE Process Execution-Particle Convergence]

——Particle group binding of physical law is reduced as the FAE

Theory, crowded to a thin disk-shaped, spreading in accordance with the Laws of Nature. Lepton electrons are excluded from the defined target degradation and is trapping the protons.



[FAE Process Execution-Injection]

——Baryons that were condensed into a thin disk-shape, they shot towards the target. In accordance with the FAE theory, the mass of baryons is moving at the speed of 10,000 km/s which exceeds the limit of magical force.



[Material-Regrowth]

——All of the processes are reversed.



“Eh?”

“What?”

“What has happened?”

Such voices were rising from the center of the audience, the wild boar immediately fell while rumbling the ground.

Of course Tatsuya, didn’t intend to give such a detailed explanation to the audience.

He bowed to the audience from Main Family, Branch Families and the Servants, he attempted to return his CAD and the bayonet attachment (actually, this was also a kind of CAD) to the case.

“Wait a minute.”

Unfortunately, a voice was withholding him from doing so.

“What is it?”

The one who detained Tatsuya was Katsushige.

Katsushige got off to the yard, wearing wooden clogs. He closed in to the cage of the wild boar, while carefully staring at the corpse.

“Just now, it was high density neutrons right. The body tissue is boiling. Yet, for some reason, the cells of the body are not activated, how does such a phenomenon occur?”

“The how, is a secret.”

There was no way Katsushige didn’t know how to do that, but he threw some resistance just in case.

“Naturally.”

Sure enough, Katsushige was upset, sharpening his voice.

“Then, I will explain what kind of phenomenon just happened. That much is not so difficult.”

Tatsuya without any resistance, showed Katsushige his Trident with its bayonet attachment.

“This is a kind of armed device which combines CAD and a pile of carbon steel in a single activation.”

As he said, the attachment shape didn’t respond to “sword”, but rather like a “pile”.

“By decomposing part of this stake to the baryonic level, I can shoot the baryons which have been condensed into a thin disk-shape.”

The base of this process was inspired by Angelina Sirius’s weapon, Brionac, which uses FAE Theory——of course, Tatsuya had no intention in revealing so much as a trick about the Free-After-Execution which he used.

“The tip portion seemed to have lost its form earlier, so it wasn’t my illusion.”

Katsushige immediately showed a convinced expression, while he began asking himself.

“That armed device is reduced to protons and neutrons? Electrons… ah, I see. The protons are tied with the electrons. So, instead of a charged particle beam, it becomes a neutron beam. Then, how come the tip portion remains plump?”

Tatsuya twisted his neck at Katsushige while wondering in his heart as to why he was so persistent to question this much to this extent.

“I completed the process with ‘Regrowth’.”

“Tsk! I see, I see!”

“I see, so that’s the case!”

Overlapping with Katsushige’s voice from the yard was the satisfactory voice of Maya.

“That’s why you named it ‘Baryon Lance’. Not ‘cannon’ or ‘launcher’, not even ‘gun’, but ‘lance’, because you incorporated ‘Regrowth’ in the final stage of the magic, right?”

From Tatuya’s point of view, it was a matter of surety that she was able to guess that since he had already exposed much of the trick so far, but Tatsuya bowed admirably to Maya since she gave the right answer.

“There’s no remaining radiation of the substance, since all the injected neutrons emitted are recovered with ‘Regrowth’, right? The only trace of the attack is the moisture in the material, as it was heated to a high temperature. Tatsuya, it’s superb!”

Tatsuya lowered his head once more.

To Tatsuya who bent his upper body, Katsushige whispered to him in a voice that couldn’t be heard by others.

“Since you’re able to use such a magic, aren’t you able to scoff at us now?”

The reason of his persistent attitude from a little while ago, was this.

However, this question was completely irrelevant.

Tatsuya pointed out mercilessly.

“ ‘Baryon Lance’ is a magic that I created in order to fight an opponent that cannot be fought with ‘Decomposition’. I don’t have to use it on any opponent to whom I can use ‘Decomposition’.”

Katsushige fell silent and blushed. He understood completely the hidden message of, “it’s faster to use decomposition, while I can”.

Katsushige directed a sharp gaze at Tatsuya. However, he wasn’t fooled enough to go on a rampage here, whether for himself or the Shibata Family, or even Kotona who sat here as well. Katsushige sighed, while trying to push back his anger inside, he was impressed by the new magic, he returned back to his seat.




The unveiling of his new magic ended safely this way. The matter about a “Neutron Barrier” that Tatsuya was concerned about, if there’s anyone who objected about the entanglement, was courteously never asked.

He wondered if it was a stopper since they’re at the celebration dinner. If the “Neutron Barrier” was exposed, he would’ve had to reveal another stage of the secret, even Tatsuya sometimes had the feeling of relief in such situations. The New Year’s Meeting itself ended without any more incidents. Tatsuya in an invisible relaxed manner, had rewritten his identity as the son of Yotsuba Maya, the current Head of Yotsuba Family, and the fiancé of Miyuki.

Then, the next day, January 2nd, 2097 A.D. The powerful magicians affiliated with the Ten Master Clans, the 18 Assistant Houses and the Hundred Families received a notice from the Yotsuba Family.



Shiba Miyuki was appointed as the next Family Head of the Yotsuba Family.



Shiba Tatsuya was the son of Yotsuba Maya. However, his name would be left as Shiba Tatsuya.

Shiba Miyuki and Shiba Tatsuya were engaged.



Many powerful magicians sent a congratulatory message addressed to the Yotsuba’s post office box at the Magic Association.

However, not all of them had sent a congratulatory message.

It was filed for the first time, January 3rd, 2097 A.D.

An objection to the engagement of Shiba Tatsuya and Shiba Miyuki to the Japan Magic Association Headquarters.

The objection was filed by Ichijou Gouki, the current head of the Ichijou Family.

Afterword




How did you like “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” Volume 16 “Yotsuba Succession Arc”? This “Yotsuba Succession Arc” is a separate episode in the series, which will tie into the new developments.

Although it looks as if we’ve reached one of the endings of “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei”, though it won’t end in an ordinary way. I think you might imagine that the last two sentences are foreshadowing.

In Volume 16, there are new characters that have made appearances in their college years and working freshman. This novel focuses on High School as its center stage, so I don’t think the non-high school characters will dominate the story. ——Although it’s a different story altogether when they’ve graduated. Therefore, this afterword will be dedicated to touch on the new characters.

First, Tsukuba Yuuka-jou. 160 cm tall, weighing 48 kg, she has a little too thin of a body. She’s 22 years old, and in her fourth year at Magic University. She was originally the Student Council Vice-President, in the generation before Mayumi’s enrollment. She has straight black hair at shoulder length. She has six piercings in her left ear and a group of four in her right. She’s a magician with a high aptitude in Mental Interference Magic in general.

Next is Shibata Katsushige-dono. He is 188 cm tall. Weighing 80kg. Katsushige has short, straight business-like black hair. He is 23 years old and has joined the Ministry of Defense this year after graduating from Magic University. He is an Office Staffer, but he has high combat capabilities and a good physique as well. He’s good at Convergence System Magic “Density Manipulation”, he is an excellent magician.

The third one is Tsutsumi Kotona-jou. She’s 165 cm tall, weighing 58 kg. She likes to wear a brown medium sauvage.

At first glance, she’s a girlish 24 year old lady. Her occupation is being Katsushige’s Guardian. She’s a second generation of modified body, “Bard Series” who have a high aptitude in sound related magic.

Lastly, Tsutsumi Kanata-kun. He is 170 cm tall, and weighs 62 kg, a boxer type guy. He has maroon colored hair with a wolf cut. A 20 year old and a second year student at Magic University. He has a part-time job as a semi-professional musician in Live House, but he is a professed Guardian of Katsushige. The real brother of Kotona, he also has a high aptitude in magic related to sound.

Each of them has their own episode that can’t be written here, but it’s still completely undecided if they are going to be published.

This time as well, thank you for your company in reading up to here. Next time, the main stage will be the Magic High School again. The events surrounding the Yotsuba Succession have stirred up both their schoolmates. Including how the Ten Master Clans will move again.

Please look forward to “Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei” Volume 17 “Ten Master Clans Conference Arc (I)”.

Notes




Matcha (抹茶): Is finely ground powder of specially grown and processed green tea. It is special in two aspects of farming and processing: the green tea plants for matcha are shade-grown for about three weeks before harvest, and the stems and veins are removed in processing. During shaded growth, the plant Camellia sinensis produces more theanine and caffeine. This combination of chemicals is considered to account for the calm energy people might feel from drinking matcha. The powdered form of matcha is consumed differently from tea leaves or tea bags, and is dissolved in a liquid, typically water or milk.

Sencha (煎茶): Is a type of Japanese ryokucha (緑茶, green tea) which is prepared by infusing the processed whole tea leaves in hot water. It is the most popular tea in Japan. This is as opposed to matcha (抹茶), powdered Japanese green tea, where the green tea powder is mixed with hot water and therefore the leaf itself is included in the beverage.
