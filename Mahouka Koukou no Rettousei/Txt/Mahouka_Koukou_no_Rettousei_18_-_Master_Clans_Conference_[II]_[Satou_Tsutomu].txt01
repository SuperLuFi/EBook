Another was to define the conditions of the Magic’s success. Until the objective of event modification is achieved, the activation continues.

Hence, it is a method to put an end to the effectiveness of the Magic Sequence itself. This method tends to be used a lot in practice.

Today’s class was about practicing Magic spells with variable durations of effectiveness. The training method used was for a student to change the color of a plastic ball from white to red, then to green, then to blue, and 10 sets of 3 color changes were to be performed in 30 seconds.

Although the time and frequency could vary, the average of 1 second per color remained.

If the change was done too late, then the time limit would be exceeded.

On the other hand, if it was executed too soon, the interference strength required to overwrite the previous Magic Sequence would increase. If this mistake was to be repeated multiple times then performing the Magic would progressively become harder, putting a lot of stress on the student.

Today was merely a practice session, not an evaluation, so the students had to group up and alternate in using Magic. The one not performing the Magician’s role had to perform the role of a timekeeper. In other words, while one of them executed Magic, the other kept track of the various timing aspects that this practice required; the timekeeper had to focus on the numerical stopwatch on his terminal, or at least that was how the previous training session went.

The problem was that the number of students from Class-A during the previous session was odd. The option of forming groups of three people was abandoned and in the end, a single person had to practice on their own. As luck would have it, that person had been Miyuki.

Actually, everyone in the class had wanted to raise their hands and pair up with Miyuki. The problem was that everyone else had already picked their partner, and now wanted to switch. It wasn’t like nobody wanted to group up with her.

Since yesterday had been the day of lessons and experiments, such a problem hadn’t popped up. Much like last week, the situation today shouldn’t have happened. ——If it hadn’t been for the fact that Masaki had just “moved in”.

“Shiba-san, would you pair up with me?”

After Masaki had been told the goal of this practice session by the teacher, he had gone towards Miyuki. He proposed pairing up to the lone student.

Noise flittered across the practice room. Words of regret and some curses escaped the lips of various boys in the classroom. It was limited to a mere “Damn, too late!”.

“Yes, with pleasure. I look forward to working with you, Ichijou-san.”

Even Miyuki might have found it unpleasant to practice alone. Hearing Masaki’s request, she nodded with a radiant smile.



When Masaki heard the explanation for the exercise, he muttered “Isn’t that easy?”.

These days, the second year students of Third High were practicing the use of Magic on a target behind a wall. That being said, the real purpose of this was to be able to cast Magic on an invisible opponent, or one taking cover behind an object.

Compared to the combat application oriented practices of Third High, Masaki couldn’t help but think of First High’s practices as a way of competing in cleverness.

And after watching Miyuki performing the task, this impression only strengthened. Miyuki perfectly changed the color of the ball in 10 sets within the allotted time of 30 seconds. What Masaki felt admiration for was the more bright and vivid colors of the ball than her perfect timing.

This plainly showed the level of her interference strength.

“30 seconds exactly. As expected of Shiba-san.”

“Thank you very much. Ichijou-san, you can start whenever you want.”

With social etiquette in mind, Masaki had praised Miyuki’s talent, and being urged on by such a lovely girl afterwards, he was now brimming with enthusiasm.

All unneeded feelings disappeared in an instant, and Masaki was now focused on his target like in a real combat situation.

“How about the count? Do you want the notice set at 10 seconds?”

Hearing Miyuki’s proposition, Masaki was about to say “There’s no need”, but reconsidered.

“…Alright then, please set the countdown for the last 10 seconds.”

Thinking that just for him, Miyuki would do the countdown had its charm for Masaki.

“Understood.”

It seemed like his cheeks were about to loosen when he heard Miyuki’s crystalline voice.

“I entrust the signal to you.”

Masaki once more focused on his Magic. His mindset had already switched to a war-like state.

“In that case, 3… 2… 1… Start!”

While Masaki was setting the time-based ending conditions in his head, he executed his Magic in succession.

Red - - Green - - Blue.

Red - - Green - - Blue.

The lively colors he created were in no way inferior to Miyuki’s.

Masaki felt satisfaction at the fact his Magical power wasn’t losing to Miyuki’s.

Red - - Green - - Blue.

Red - - Green - - - Blue.

Maybe caused by his idle thinking, his rhythm started to fall apart.

To correct his mistake, he tried to adjust the timings.

Red - Green - - Blue.

According to his own time perception, the discrepancy had been dealt with.

Red - - Green - Blue.

Now, however, the problem lied in the fact that due to his adjustments, he was too far ahead.

Red - - - Green - - - Blue.

Masaki waited more than 1 second in order to slow down his sets.

Red - - Green - - Blue.

He then managed to get back to the regular interval. He decided to make the final adjustments during the countdown.

“10… 9… 8…”

Miyuki’s countdown started.

His error margin was less than a second’s time.

Masaki opted for correcting the error on the final sequence.

“3… 2…”

Red - Green,

“1…”

Blue.

The plastic ball went back to its original white color.

“It’s over.”

Slightly late, Miyuki reported the end of the time limit.

“Remaining: 0 - 7 seconds. It’s very hard to imagine that this is your first time Ichijou-san.”

Miyuki turned a smiling face towards Masaki.

Masaki hid the cramp that was forming on his face and returned a smile.

The passing line for this exercise was for the last color change to be within a single second of the timer’s end. The reason he managed to clear the exercise was thanks to the countdown. When thinking that Miyuki managed to perfectly time hers without Masaki’s assistance, he really couldn’t feel pleased at all.

“Just 30 seconds. Not bad, Honoka.”

“Eh-he-he, this is my area of predilection after all.”

Hearing the nearby voice, Masaki received an even stronger shock.

Using the remaining time for the session, Masaki finally managed to achieve the clearing conditions on his own.




After the morning classes ended.

“Ichijou-san.”

Masaki had finally managed to recover from the shock he had received from having to actually put effort in the practice session from before. He was called by a girl from the side.

Masaki turned his face towards the voice. He was like any other Magician and possessed a good memory. He could remember Honoka’s name almost without any lag.

“Umm, Mitsui-san was it?”

The fact that he remembered her name was not due to her previously introducing herself nor hearing her name from someone else. He remembered her as the victor of this year’s Nine Schools Competition in the Mirage Bat category.

“Yes, my name is Mitsui Honoka.”

Honoka nodded with a pleased face. She didn’t have any interest in Masaki, but knowing each other’s names would make their interactions smoother. Honoka had smiled in relief.

Masaki interpreted her smile as pure courtesy as well.

“Ichijou-san, would you like to go to the dining room together?”

“Huh, with me?”

That was why, such an invitation took him by surprise.

“Yes, with us.”

Honoka looked over her shoulders.





There stood Shizuku and Miyuki.

When she met Masaki’s gaze, Shizuku nodded without changing her expression. No, well, maybe it had been a bow? Shizuku’s reaction had been that ambiguous.

As for Miyuki, she was displaying a smile that hid what she was really thinking. But at the very least, to Masaki, this smile didn’t give off the impression that he’d be a bother.

“…Is it alright for me to go with you?”

Instinctively using the polite tone again, Masaki replied so.

Realizing that his eyes were turned towards her, although her smile still looked slightly bitter, Miyuki’s expression softened.

The smile that gave off a faking sentiment turned into a warm smile.

“Yes, certainly.”

To Miyuki’s answer,

“It would be my pleasure!”

Masaki stood up with vigor.



“Huh?”

This first person who saw Miyuki’s group, who was slightly late for lunch, had been Erika.

Yesterday she had thought “He will try to stick to Miyuki for sure” and was surprised when Masaki kept his distance. But now she was suspicious that Masaki was acting exactly like she originally predicted.

She wasn’t the only one. Leo and Mikihiko were also looking at Masaki with intrigued eyes.

“Umm, Onii-sama… Is it alright if Ichijou-san shares a seat with us?”

“Of course.”

However, Tatsuya answered as if it had been obvious. An immediate response.

Rather, Masaki was the one who was puzzled right now.

Masaki, who was standing there dumbfounded, was spoken to by Tatsuya in a direct —— that is to say, not in a particularly friendly way —— tone.

“Ichijou, do you know how to place an order? The purchase system of the cafeteria should be something rather standard.”

“Ah, yeah. No problem.”

“Let’s go, Ichijou-san.”

Being urged on by Miyuki, he went towards the ordering machine with her. Honoka and Shizuku followed just behind him.

Having retrieved her meal, Miyuki sat down next to Tatsuya.

Masaki sat down right in front of her.

Honoka was next to Masaki, right in front of Tatsuya.

Erika, who had been sitting in front of Tatsuya, gave her seat to Honoka and moved next to Miyuki.

Erika, who had purposefully taken a roundabout path around the table, suddenly spoke to Masaki.

“Ichijou-kun, how’s the investigation going?”

Masaki almost choked on his freshly acquired bowl of soup. Since he had seen Erika a few times already, he wasn’t surprised at her overly familiar attitude. What had surprised him was the fact that she asked him such a question about a duty verging on a grey line with the law, in a place where anyone could be listening.

“Erika, Ichijou has just arrived in Tokyo. No matter how outstandingly superior a Magician he is, there is no way he’d accomplish something like that in a day.”

While Masaki was struggling to find a way to answer, surprisingly for him, he was rescued by Tatsuya.

“I guess that’s true.”

“Indeed, Erika. This is not something you should ask in such a pressing manner. Ichijou-san, sorry about that.”

Lightly reproving Erika, Miyuki bowed towards Masaki.

“No, well, this isn’t something that needs an apology or anything.”

Miyuki directed an innocent smile towards Masaki who was getting flustered. Masaki’s pure-hearted reaction might have been something refreshing for her.

“That being said, I envy you, Ichijou-san.”

“Ah? Umm, what about?”

With Miyuki’s dazzling smile turned towards him, Masaki was getting more and more restless.

“For you to be called a ‘outstandingly superior Magician’ by Onii-sama. Onii-sama is unexpectedly nice to you.”

Miyuki sent a look of reproach to Masaki while smiling. No, to be more precise, it was more like envy?

Of course it was just a joke; however, what little calm Masaki had managed to preserve was blown away in an instant, he couldn’t think of anything. His concerns about Miyuki calling Tatsuya “Onii-sama” as well flew out of his mind.

Tatsuya opened his mouth. “That’s not the case” he said. Maybe it had been to turn Miyuki’s gaze away from Masaki, maybe it had been a straight manner of scolding her for teasing him, but anyway, it was obvious that Tatsuya had again come to his rescue.

“So after all, Tatsuya-san recognizes Ichijou-san’s ability.”

However, as if covering for her, Honoka interrupted his sentence.

“That’s nice. It feels like some sort of rivalry between two men.”

“You might say rival, but in terms of Magical Power, it’s pretty clear that Ichijou comes out on top.”

Being so directly talked to, Tatsuya had no choice but to turn his attention away from Miyuki. Without wasting time, Tatsuya turned his attention to the person in front of him.

“However, isn’t what we’re practicing currently Tatsuya’s field of expertise?”

“Well, that is because the current theme requires precision more than speed and strength.”

Without humbling himself, Tatsuya honestly replied to Honoka.

“Tatsuya-san managed from the very beginning to perfectly time every color change for 1 second.”

Mizuki seemed to be completely relaxed, and she opened her mouth as if she had been the one praised.

“Really!? Tatsuya-san, that’s incredible!”

Hearing Honoka and Mizuki’s speeches damaged Masaki quite clearly.

Miyuki, who was seated right in front of him couldn’t overlook this, and gave him some comforting words.

“Even though I always stay within the time limit, I still end up being slightly too fast or too slow.”

However, Honoka who sitting next to him and was even closer, hadn’t noticed.

“Tatsuya-san, isn’t there some kind of trick for this?”

Being overjoyed at Miyuki showing sympathy for Masaki, she couldn’t help but try to draw Tatsuya’s attention.

From Honoka’s point of view, everything was going according to the plan.

It had been Honoka who proposed to invite Masaki to their table. She had planned on pushing Masaki towards Miyuki while using this chance to get closer to Tatsuya herself.

Saying this is wicked would be pitiful.

“All’s fair in love and war” was a popular phrase that originated from a tragicomedy of Great Britain from the 17th century. That being said, in modern times, there were strategies that were established as forbidden by a multinational treaty, so you couldn’t say that this phrase was true for everything.

It remained true for the matters of love, and you couldn’t say that everything was allowed. For instance, using a lie like “I am bearing your child” to force your lover to give you money in order to part with you, those kinds of things were usually restricted by your sense of morals.

Still, what Honoka did was not exactly foul play; all things considered, this was pretty common for a girl in love. Using her friend’s partner that way might be considered in bad taste, but it only served as evidence of Honoka’s strong love.




After leaving Miyuki at school and going back home, Tatsuya mounted his favorite motorbike and headed towards Tsuchiura. Needless to say, his destination was the National Defense Base of the 101st Brigade. It was the headquarters of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion.

Tatsuya was sporting a rough appearance on his bike, wearing trousers that looked like they were made out of leather, topped off with a large and imposing jacket. But the only thing that mattered at the gate was your ID, and from Tatsuya removing his helmet, he was granted access to the base.

Parking his motorbike in front of headquarters, he looked at the third floor of the building. His grave look was due to the negotiations —— neither a report nor a consultation —— that would come.

Still, it wasn’t possible to ignore it. The fact that the Ten Master Clans had taken an official stance regarding the terrorism perpetrated by Gu Jie at Hakone had mainly been in order to attenuate the anti-magician hate.

However, after hearing about Gu Jie’s activities in Kamakura, it was decided that Tatsuya would have to bring them down as soon as possible. It hadn’t been an order from Maya, but something he proposed of his own volition.

Gu Jie’s method of using Magicians as literal tools for his goals went against Tatsuya’s ambition of giving Magicians a way to live without being instruments of war.

These were irreconcilable differences. In the future that Tatsuya envisioned, Gu Jie’s existence was something that could not be allowed.

Gu Jie had to be killed. In order to achieve that, he would have to get rid of the victims he used as tools…

Lightly shaking his head to settle down, Tatsuya entered the building and asked that his arrival be relayed. In reality, he didn’t even want to phone beforehand, but he couldn’t just suddenly intrude without at least doing that much.

There was still 5 minutes before the designated time, but Tatsuya proceeded through. Was this place shorthanded as usual? He hardly met anyone on his way to the commander’s room.

“Special Lieutenant Ooguro.”

He raised his voice towards the room after knocking on the door. It wasn’t like his voice could directly pass through the door, but it was equipped with a microphone that automatically picked up voices. It was something visitors were unaware of.

“Enter.”

Actually, the voice originated from the speaker system embedded inside the door. The technology had advanced to the point that the speaker wasn’t visible to the user.

After he heard the sound confirming that the lock had been removed, Tatsuya opened the door.

Kazama was sitting at the desk in front of him, it seemed that today he was alone. A touch-screen terminal was on his desk, he was most likely looking over a proposal or a report until Tatsuya arrived. His responsibilities appear to have increased with his promotion.

Tatsuya stepped in front of his desk and saluted.

Although Kazama stood up to return the salute, he immediately sat down again. Tatsuya, who wasn’t invited to take a seat, stayed still.

“Special Lieutenant, at ease. So, what suddenly brings you here today?”

That wasn’t to say that Kazama was irritated. Even his voice had remained calm.

“Since our communication could have been intercepted, I thought that I would come and report to you directly.”

“Oh… Are you saying my battalion’s encryption code could have been cracked?”

“Affirmative. Actually, I was warned that there was a high probability that the communication codes of the Yotsuba Family have been deciphered already.”

Tatsuya revealed one of his cards immediately.

Kazama’s eyebrow twitched lightly.

“…Still, I think that the codes we are using should be stronger than the Yotsuba Family’s.”

“I am of the same opinion. But still, I thought that this was enough of a reason to be careful.”

Although Tatsuya didn’t mention exactly on what grounds he had thought that there was a need to be cautious, Kazama didn’t object.

“…Alright. Special Lieutenant, state your business.”

“There is a possibility that the special forces training grounds of the Zama base have been corrupted by foreign elements.”

The Special Forces Training Grounds —— This place had received this name due to fact that it gathered numerous Magic users who had seen their Magic Power strengthened after training there, and received the name “Special Tactical Soldiers”. Despite its name, it wasn’t so much a training center as a place where experiments were conducted on living humans. The Defense Forces were keeping those reinforced Magicians in a few of the well-known facilities.

Just this information alone would cause a large scandal for the Ministry of Defense if it was leaked, but the Zama base had another secret.

Within its walls, joint research was being conducted with the USNA.

Even though it was something unbeknownst to the rest of the world, it remained true that they were providing Japanese citizens for some foreigners to experiment on.

This was a dark side of the government that could never be made public, and a shameful heritage of the pre-war days.

Tatsuya was reporting that this kind of facility, which was constantly under extreme surveillance, had been partially taken over by foreign powers.

“…Did something happen?”

Kazama didn’t ask “What?” nor “Is that true?”. Neither did he ask “On what grounds can you say that?”.

Kazama was trying to figure out what could have happened to make Tatsuya come to this conclusion.

“Last Saturday at dawn, during the pursuit of the mastermind behind the Hakone terrorist acts, Gu Jie, there had been interference from Magicians specializing in ‘Combustion’. Without a doubt, these Magicians were supposed to be on standby at the Zama base.”

The special forces training grounds of the Zama base were especially useful in times of war, with psychics strengthened for “Ignition” or “Explosion”. The three people that Tatsuya killed last Saturday at Kamakura, after an investigation by Yoshimi, turned out to be Magicians who had been changed into “Generators” at the special training grounds of the Zama base.

“Are you saying that the terrorists’ hand has extended as far as the Zama base?”

“Affirmative.”

Kazama folded his arms and leaked a groan, a frown on his face. It had already been quite a scandal that Zhou Gongjin had concealed himself in the Uji Second Supply Base, but for geographical reasons, anything pertaining to the Zama base was immediately an even more serious matter.

It was right under the nose of the capital, Tokyo. A facility made in order to hide the truth about experiments on living beings. A comfortable cage where combatants comparable to heavy weapons were confined.

The simple fact that one of those bodies which had been experimented on managed to slip out of the base was a big problem in and of itself. If it became known that such beings had become the underlings of an anti-Japanese operative, then it probably wouldn’t just end with the National Defense taking responsibility.

“Who is aware of this?”

Kazama closed his eyes and asked Tatsuya so.

“So far, only the members of the Yotsuba Family.”

In other words, this information hadn’t leaked to the Ten Master Clans.

Hearing this, Kazama’s expression seemingly softened. Still, he had kept his posture with his arms folded, and his frown remained.

“Does Special Lieutenant intend on attacking the Zama base?”

“Negative, Lieutenant Colonel.”

Tatsuya’s tone had changed subtly.

“Even though Zhou Gongjin had been given shelter in the Uji Second Supply Base, I don’t think Gu Jie would do something similar in Zama’s base.”

“Gu Jie… Is that the name of the mastermind?”

Hearing a name that rang a bell in his head, Kazama looked up at Tatsuya, unfolding his arms.

“However, didn’t you just say that the experimented bodies of the Zama base had become the pawns of this Gu Jie?”

“There is no mistake in that fact. However, while it is true that reinforced Magicians from the special training grounds have been turned into ‘Generators’, assuming that Gu Jie himself is present there and responsible for this would be presumptuous.”

“So you think that someone in the Zama base cooperated with Gu Jie and took the reinforced Magicians out of the base?”

“Affirmative.”

“Hmm… Compared to thinking that an unidentified foreigner infiltrated the base, this is certainly more realistic. However, how exactly did he do that?”

“A staff member from the special forces training ground might have been turned into a puppet. There might be a Magician capable of an operation as complex as performing the remodeling needed to create a ‘Generator’, along with depriving someone of his free-will.”

Kazama put both of his elbows on the desk and joined his hands while silently thinking.

“…Are the identities of the people turned into Generators known?”

“Here.”

Tatsuya took out an unsealed envelope and presented it to Kazama. He retrieved 3 folded sheets of paper from it. These were photographs of the 3 people that had been turned into Generators, and their bodily features were recorded as well.

“If we shared that information with the base of Zama, we could probably get our hands on the puppets in a few days. However, would it be possible for this investigation to be left to me?”

Kazama matched Tatsuya’s gaze, still sitting. He was looking at him with such intensity that it probably wouldn’t have been exaggerating to call it a glare.

Tatsuya then revealed his second card.

“Speaking bluntly, I know where Gu Jie’s hideout is. However, that place is next to Zama’s base.”

“…Are you worried about involving Zama’s base and having this turn into an all-out battle?”

To Kazama’s low, yet heavy voice, Tatsuya returned an answer immediately.

“That is a possibility. Especially since the members of Special Forces Training Grounds of Zama’s base hold a strong enmity towards the Ten Master Clans, if someone who was sent there to investigate agitated them too much, it could be dangerous.”

Kazama couldn’t deny Tatsuya’s prediction possibly happening. This was a facility made with the goal of not letting its residents escape.

Various adjustments had been made in order to not let even the bodies that had gone through the strengthening experiment have a chance of leaving. With that in mind, escape was basically nothing but a dream.

Still, it was a fact that, every year, the Ten Master Clans helped in dealing with cases of escapees.

It might sound inhumane, but for the Defense Forces, disposing of them was a much safer way. If the experimented subject survived, it would take a great deal of effort to keep the whole thing a secret. On the other hand, a dead body would leave no tangible evidence behind it. Taking the power and influence of the government into account, burying such a mundane affair in the dark would be no trouble. At the very least, compared to the cost of keeping one alive, it was far cheaper.

If headquarters learned that an unauthorized fight broke out near Zama that involved a member of the Ten Master Clans, and the Yotsuba Family… They could make experiments escape on purpose to put the responsibility of disposal on the Yotsuba Family. This was a scenario that was likely to happen.

“Concerning the non-intervention promise made to the Zama base, we will need the cooperation of the General.”

“We wouldn’t have the time for this. Gu Jie would be able to escape.”

“…Special Lieutenant, do you want to settle things once and for all?”

“I’m planning to avoid as many fights as possible with National Defense personnel. However, if a fight broke out by accident or due to unavoidable circumstances, I will erase every single trace of it.”

Tatsuya was saying that if need be, he’d use his “Mist Dispersion” even on allied troops.

“It might be impossible to do otherwise.”

With a bitter expression on his face, yet deprived of hesitation, Kazama permitted the use of Tatsuya’s Mist Dispersion.




It was 8 P.M. when Tatsuya finally arrived near the Zama base, having traveled from the Tsuchiura base after taking his time to settle various affairs.

He didn’t talk to Katsuto and Mayumi about his coming here today. Of course, not even to Masaki. He missed today’s meeting as well. Rather, members of the Yotsuba Family were his companions.

It seemed like all the members were already gathered. Tatsuya stopped his motorcycle in the public park’s parking lot and stepped up to a van.

“Fumiya, Ayako, you did well in coming despite today being a weekday.”

Once he was in whispering distance he called out to his second cousins in a low voice, they had been erasing their presence just like he was.

“Tatsuya-niisan!”

While keeping his voice down as well, although unable to completely hide his astonishment, Fumiya responded.

“I didn’t even feel your presence. You keep getting better and better at being invisible.”

“Good evening, Tatsuya-san. I understand that the current situation demands it, but since this is bad for my heart, could you be more considerate?”

Fumiya let out undisguised praise while Ayako reproached him. Her attitude had changed a little ever since his engagement with Miyuki had been announced.

She was less reserved, and it looked like the distance between them had shortened.

However, this was Ayako trying her best to accept the reality of the current situation.

“It looked like Yoshimi-san would faint due to the shock.”

Near Ayako, Yoshimi shook her head from left to right in her usual mysterious style.

“Yoshimi-san, you don’t need to hold back. Tatsuya-san, despite being so straightforward, utterly lacks any form of common sense; in this situation it wouldn’t do any good to hide the truth.”

Those words may have been surprisingly abusive, but Yoshimi wasn’t one to have reserved thoughts. She was more the type to let her guard down.

“I’m alright. I won’t be shaken by something like this.”

“Eh…? But you looked pretty surprised from what I saw.”

“It’s not the case. I’m an adult after all.”

Yoshimi had become quite talkative with Ayako as well. Her wariness might also have loosened since they were cousins. For Ayako and Fumiya, Tatsuya was their elder second cousin, from their father’s side of the family.

Yoshimi, on the other hand is the daughter of the brother of Ayako’s mother. In other words, their maternal cousin.

Yoshimi’s full name was Shinonome Yoshimi. Although she was currently 21 years old, she wasn’t going to school. Even during her high school years, she had followed a correspondence system. Thus, she could perform investigative duties while learning.

With this in mind, it would make sense if she had developed a sort of elder sister role towards Ayako, but looking at them, it was pretty clear that it was Ayako who would grasp the initiative. It wasn’t due to her status as the daughter of the current Kuroba Family Head, but rather just their personalities.

“Tatsuya-niisan, are you going to change your clothes inside?”

Fumiya asked Tatsuya while ignoring the girls and their playful attitudes. Combat equipment for the upcoming operation had been prepared in the van.

By the way, Fumiya’s appearance was, as usual, his cross-dressing disguise. Although, had he finally decided to be more attractive with his make-up thicker than before.

“Alright.”

Without talking about Fumiya’s pretty girl style, he got in the vehicle.



The combat suit that the Yotsuba had prepared more or less looked like the clothes Tatsuya had been wearing just a few moments ago. The only difference would be that the blouson insides were tied up. However, as far as performance was concerned, it rivaled that of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion’s Mobile Suit.

Today, Tatsuya wasn’t using the gun-shaped Silver Horn but the thought-controlled type set with a Silver Taurus bracelet. Hidden inside his blouson wasn’t another CAD but a gun and a knife. If they were found by the police, it wouldn’t end with just an inquiry. This was also one of the reasons why they had changed their clothes here and not elsewhere.

The helmet Tatsuya was wearing could also function as a gas mask.

Fumiya was looking at his brave figure admiringly while he himself was wearing a mini-dress full of button ornaments —— that being said, all of those buttons were gas capsules and flashbangs —— when he called out to Ayako.

“We’re going soon.”

Fumiya, who was already looking at Tatsuya, nodded immediately.

Ayako and Yoshimi, who had somehow gone into a “Whose appearance is not suitable for this mission” debate, turned towards Tatsuya and slightly bowed.

Tatsuya, then, began to walk.

Directly behind him were Fumiya and Ayako, as well as several men in black suits.

The number of shadows around Yoshimi suddenly increased, and then she saw the three of them off.



“Still, the surveillance is pretty tight.”

Using something that resembled binoculars —— a sensor that made infrared rays as well as electromagnetic waves visible —— she reported so to Tatsuya in a concerned voice.

The three of them were observing the target building from inside the invisibility field that Ayako produced. Yoshimi had read this “Memory” of Gu Jie’s new hideout from the corpse of a former Generator. Although it was nothing but a private hospital on paper, in truth, this place undertook illegal requests from the army as an unofficial research facility. The intense policing they saw was to be expected.

“It wouldn’t be too difficult to sneak into the building, but with this kind of heavy surveillance, I don’t think they’ll only have guards. There might be some other things waiting for us.”

“So you think that there is some sort of trap set up?”

“Yes.”

Tatsuya assessed the situation with his own eyes.

Considering that we’re talking about an organization that was used to take on military missions, they were sure to be prepared.

The hospital’s owner might have already had his heart remodeled. He may even have been killed already. Anyone would’ve been able to guess as much, was what Tatsuya was thinking.

Based on this, he searched both the interior and exterior of the building.

The security equipment was certainly overbearing, but it wasn’t anything out of the extraordinary for a private operation. Compared to the several sensors installed throughout the Steeplechase event in the Nine Schools Competition, this was nothing.

He could see nine human shadows inside of the building.

Five of those people had a normal human’s information structure. They were probably doctors and nurses on duty.

One person had noise in the information structure of his head. He was probably the director of the hospital who had been made into a puppet.

Two people had a distorted information structure type that Tatsuya had seen before. Without a doubt, those two were Generators.

And a single person with a strange information structure was there.

Although he seemed more similar to a regular human than a Generator, his age data was definitely weird.

Even if a person had changed their body’s age to be different than their actual age, only their true age would be shown. The body’s age would be shown alongside their general health.

However, in the information body that Tatsuya was looking at now, there existed two different datasets for his age.

(Such an information body, I have seen one similar before… When, and where was it?)

Tatsuya sifted through the vast amount of data in his head, quickly finding what he was looking for.

(I see, this was Zhou Gongjin’s…)

Due to the fact that Tatsuya had been solely concentrating on localizing his true location that was camouflaged by Ghost Walker, the abnormality in Zhou’s information structure had gone unnoticed at that time.

However, with Tatsuya never forgetting a single detail, a sense of discomfort appeared.

“Found him. This is probably Gu Jie in person.”

Tatsuya reported to Ayako and Fumiya with a whisper.

Tension ran through the muscles of their back.

“Let’s move in immediately.”

Fumiya replied with a whispering voice, too. It looked like Ayako didn’t have an objection, either.

The three people walked towards the front gate. Due to the magic of the men in black suits, regular humans couldn’t see them. Although they had received orders to avoid a fight to the best of their ability, if there was any possibility of the National Defense getting involved, those orders would be ignored.

“Tatsuya-san.”

Nodding at Ayako’s voice, Tatsuya pressed the button on the radio he had in his hand.

The light that was illuminating the hospital’s gate disappeared. The men in black had cut the electrical wire that was supplying the building with energy. The wire in the ground as well; since there was no need to dig it up due to Magic, it had been a simple task.

To begin with, despite being a private hospital, it was still a proper hospital. It was quite probable that the building had an emergency power supply.

Tatsuya confirmed that the security system had been cut off and signaled Ayako with his hands.

Using Ayako’s “Mock Teleportation”, the three of them jumped on the roof of the hospital.

The light had yet to be restored.

“Let’s proceed as planned.”

The plan was simple, Ayako was to secure their retreat while Fumiya acted as her guard.

Tatsuya was to secure Gu Jie’s capture on his own.

Even though both Ayako and Fumiya had strongly opposed this plan, they weren’t so childish as to pose difficulties when the strategy had already been set in motion.

“Please be careful.”

The brother and sister, who looked like a pair of pretty sisters at present, sent him off in unison.



The lights came back on at almost the exact moment Tatsuya entered the building from the rooftop.

Looking at him, not even a trace of panic was present. This timing was roughly what he had expected, so it wasn’t as if it had been “in the nick of time”.

However, he wasn’t being carefree at all. Did their target guess that this kind of operation was taking place due to the power outage? The information body that Tatsuya thought was Gu Jie immediately headed for the emergency stairway from his former position in a room on the 3rd floor.

This movement was convenient for Tatsuya. The risk of involving doctors or nurses became smaller with it.

Tatsuya dashed towards the emergency exit, but stopped in his tracks once he reached the last room in the hallway.

Bullets came flying out of the door and crashed into the wall on the other side.

Tatsuya switched his “View” from the emergency stairs and focused it on the weapon of his ambusher.

He used “Decomposition” on the gun.

The Magic Sequence for “Ignition” was nullified and rendered useless by his Gram Dispersion.

The gun of another Generator who was approaching from the back was decomposed.

A door was vigorously flung open, and Magicians turned into Generators jumped out to attack him.

They were not only wielding strengthened magical skills from being prime field agents turned into Generators in the National Defense’s facilities, they were also making use of power and speed impossible for humans to achieve. One of the Generators tried to stab Tatsuya with a knife.

However, not only was Tatsuya a product of the Fourth Research Institute, he was also a Magician heavily trained in hand-to-hand combat. The training he had received had been more oriented towards physical strength rather than magic. As someone who primarily learned to use his body, he was completely familiar with the process of controlling his body with Psions.

Though he hadn’t received biochemical enhancements to make his body stronger, Tatsuya made up for this disadvantage by protecting the information structure of his muscles so that even if the burden on his bones exceeded the limits, his body wouldn’t suffer damage.

The Generator used the “Body Ignition” Magic on Tatsuya. Not needing a CAD, that might have been the proof that he had psychic ancestors.

Tatsuya once again used his Gram Dispersion towards the Magic Sequence aimed at him. At the same time, the Generator’s blade was parried with his own knife that he took out of his blouson.

The blade lock lasted an instant.

After Tatsuya parried the attack, his power slipped out, but at the same time, the Generator leaped back.

Tatsuya had wanted to destroy his opponent’s posture, but it ended up only lasting for a moment.

On the other hand, he had gained a distance where knives wouldn’t be able to reach.

Tatsuya turned his back on his opponent.

He then threw his knife towards another Generator who was approaching from the back.

Perhaps due to this surprising action, the opponent stopped and had to parry the knife throw with his own knife.

His eyes let go of Tatsuya for an instant.

When he turned his attention back to him, Tatsuya had pulled out his gun.

He turned his gun towards the Generator.

Due to the attached suppressor, a small gunshot sound leaked.

The Generator who had expected a magic attack ate a bullet straight from the front.

The high caliber bullet hit him right in the stomach, and the Generator, who had roughly the same physique as Tatsuya, was pushed back. No bleeding could be seen on the Generator who was now on the ground.

That was evidence that he was wearing an effective body armor.

Tatsuya turned around once more.

The other Generator had aimed for his neck with the knife in his right hand, and Tatsuya caught it at the wrist with his left hand.

His Magic Calculation Area dissolved the Magic Sequences of “Ignition” and “Scorching” that the Generator was about to unleash.

That Generator’s casting speed was nearing instantaneous levels as a psychic. By sacrificing diversity, his event modification speed had been so drastically enhanced that he could provoke it just by wishing. This came with being a Generator. By getting rid of their free will, it was possible to free up mental activity resources.

However, even with this, Tatsuya’s “Decomposition” was faster. Even faster than the Generator could complete his magic, Tatsuya’s decomposition came out first.

Tatsuya twisted the Generator’s right hand and broke his wrist. He then shot him from up-close with his gun.

Even though he didn’t have the capacity to feel pain, his faltering physical condition made magic execution nigh-impossible.

Even though the first Generator who had been knocked out had already recovered, his magic execution speed still wasn’t back to its normal level.

Suppressing all the Magic Sequences of his opponents, reserve power arose in Tatsuya’s Magic Calculation Area with which he counterattacked.

Tatsuya used “Partial Dismantling”.

In that instant, holes opened up in the chests of the Generators.

Although the Generators continued to weakly struggle without their hearts, they were in their death throes, and soon, even that stopped.

After confirming that all Psion activity had stopped, Tatsuya headed towards the emergency stairway once more.

Gu Jie had apparently already reached the 1st floor.

Tatsuya jumped down the stairway.

Avoiding damage with minimal inertia control magic, he aimed at the ambulance that Gu Jie had planned on using to escape.

Why was there an ambulance despite no emergency being signaled?

Why was there a need for an ambulance to be bulletproof and heat-resistant? Any such questions were shelved in the depth of Tatsuya’s mind.

The Psion noise provoked by the Cast Jamming emanating from the ambulance wasn’t a problem for him either.

The only thing that was left as an obstacle from Tatsuya were several High Power Rifle bullets shot in succession towards him.




On that day, a large-scale VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft from the USNA came flying to the Zama base. Considering that the Zama base was a shared territory between Japan and the USNA, this was not unusual. The existence of the Special Forces Training Grounds was a secret that was known to the USNA for historical reasons. There was no reason to refuse the landing and no possibility of that to begin with.

After the aircraft landed, the commander of the base accepted a report from the commanding officer of the transport. This wasn’t unusual either. In the case of the commander, if there were specific reasons to this visit, it could save some trouble.

The commander of the USNA Army introduced himself as Major Benjamin Lowes. The impression that the base’s commander had of him was that of a high-class officer, fearless yet smart. Not only because of their current alliance, but also because he had the type of personality which made him not behave in an unnecessarily rude way.

Still, the base’s commander didn’t relax. He understood with a glance that it was a high-caliber Magician who had just entered the room.

Since this was a base where Magicians were strengthened, there were precise magic power measurement devices. And although he had skillfully influenced the measurement results, on the contrary, it had only served to prove the height of his skill.

After the formal diplomatic exchanges, Major Lowes started to discuss an incredible matter with a refined tone.

“It is shameful to say, but I have been sent here in order to capture deserters.”

“Deserters, you say?”

The commander of the base barely managed to swallow his “Again?”.

He was one of the few officers who was aware that last year’s troubles with vampires had been caused by USNA deserters. This, too, was due to the special circumstances of the Special Force Training Grounds of Zama’s base.

“As you might know, on December of the year before last, soldiers of our army had deserted and fled to your country. Although we confirmed that most of them died, it appears that it wasn’t all of them.”

Major Lowes —— Commander of the Stars’ First Unit, Benjamin Canopus, seeing through the commander’s doubts, came up with a lie.

Since the commander wasn’t aware of absolutely all the details, he couldn’t doubt these words.

“We’re not sure what exactly their objectives are but we have confirmed that the deserters plan on kidnapping the doctor who has been providing medical treatment to the Magicians of this base. The attack will take place tonight.”

“…Major, you have our gratitude for this information.”

“Commander, I think you have an idea of what I’m about to ask of you.”

We will deal with this attack ourselves, was what the commander was about to say. Considering that this was about to take place right in front of their noses and that it concerned civilians who were cooperating with them, it was no wonder.

However, Canopus anticipated this reaction and prevented this sentence from coming out.

“I heard that the Ten Master Clans are also pursuing the deserters of our army. We think that stimulating the Magicians currently stationed in this base would be unfavorable for both of our countries.”

The commander made a sour face and swallowed the sentence he was about to say.

“Could you, at your discretion, overlook my unit’s action in this matter?”

“…This exceeds the range of discretion I am allowed as an officer. Approbation from headquarters is needed.”

“Commander. It’s an urgent matter. The deserter’s attack could happen in a matter of hours. If you say that it is impossible for you to entrust this entirely to us, we could agree to a joint operation with your own forces.”

Canopus played his cards right here and now.

“Indeed, if you could lend us soldiers of the Special Force Training Grounds… Number 024, 026, 029, 037 and 041 would be suitable for such a task.”

Those were the numbers of the strengthened Magicians that had been stolen by Gu Jie.

“…I agree to this cooperation. However, I’ll have you leave the reporting duty to me!”

Towards the speech of the commander, Canopus returned a salute with a nonchalant face.

This event had taken place 3 hours before Tatsuya had rushed into action.




Even though Tatsuya instinctively protected his vital points, he couldn’t dodge entirely. The first bullet hit his left arm, the second incoming bullet was decomposed while he rolled on the ground. The wound he received on his left shoulder was already healed by his “Regrowth” by the time he hit the ground.

The sniper who intervened just before Tatsuya could catch Gu Jie came from the sky. No, with such power, a better way of putting it would be that he fell from the sky.

Neither the shadow of a plane nor a helicopter could be seen. It was as if he had been shot from a human cannon to this place.

(Why is the USNA military here!?)

Tatsuya couldn’t help but be surprised after reading that person’s information with Elemental Sight.

Again, Zama was a joint Japan-USNA joint base. That a USNA soldier was present there was not that mysterious.

However, why would such a person help Gu Jie’s escape?

Despite holding such thoughts and hesitations, as a combat magician, half of his mind had automatically reacted to disempower the appearing threat.

The High Power Rifle the opponent was wielding was instantly turned into separate parts as well as the body armor he was wearing.

If that person had been a National Defense soldier, Tatsuya would’ve erased him.

However, since Tatsuya hadn’t thought about the USNA military possibly being involved, he had yet to decide an appropriate way of dealing with them.

(Erasing him would be —— bad.) Tatsuya concluded so after disarming the soldier. He was currently in the middle of an illegal operation. Giving the USNA a pretext to accuse Japan of abducting their soldiers would be troublesome.

Tatsuya shot at the soldier who was standing there, petrified, as he had yet to understand how exactly he had been disarmed. Once that was done, Tatsuya used his “Regrowth” to restore his body armor and rifle to their original state. This whole process had the sole purpose of making out which magic was used against the target next to impossible to discern.

Then, once again, he went after Gu Jie. The ambulance that Gu Jie had boarded had already driven off.

Tatsuya expanded his “View” to search for Gu Jie’s location.

However, he was unable to. The “Eyes” of Tatsuya were focused on something whose priority was higher, something that he couldn’t ignore.

Fumiya and Ayako were fighting hard.

He ran in the building at full speed.



Fumiya’s reaction to the soldiers who landed on the rooftop was immediate.

The Magic that allowed one to inflict damage to the mind and the soul, “Direct Pain”, deprived the soldiers’ hands of their strength and made them drop their weapons. Still, one couldn’t say that his reaction to the grenades that had been thrown from their back had been enough.

Ayako immediately erected a physical barrier, one that would correctly interact with the fragments released by the explosion. However, the grenades that had been shot were not exploding ones, but smoke grenades.

The rapidly expanding smoke made it even harder to see than it already was.

Fumiya was able to unleash magic without relying on his eyes, but he was still a long way from reaching Tatsuya’s level.

Fumiya’s “Direct Pain” was a magic that targeted the mind and the soul.

He apparently thought that not being able to maintain visual contact wouldn’t affect the magic’s effect too much.

However, it was in fact the opposite. The “Spirit” doesn’t exist in this world. Even if one were to search for them, he wouldn’t know where to look. Therefore, to aim this Magic, a link from this world to the spirit world was needed. Suddenly, a screeching like the scratching of glass came from the smokescreen towards Ayako and Fumiya.

“Cast Jamming?”

“No, not exactly. But, this is…?”

Ayako was the one to answer Fumiya’s doubt. Still, there was no trace of relief on her face at knowing that this wasn’t Cast Jamming. She anxiously searched for the noise’s source.

Fumiya, on the other hand, concluded that as long as this wasn’t the noise of Psion obstructing magic execution, finding out its source could be postponed. At the moment, their priority was to push back this mysterious enemy.

With the CAD on his right hand, he had planned on using an Activation Sequence to blow away the smoke screen with an air flow. However…

His CAD wasn’t functioning properly. His Activation Sequence was filled with “noise”.

The CAD he had tried to use was a Generalized portable terminal-type CAD, and he was as used to this one as the knuckle duster Specialized CAD he used before. Someone of Fumiya’s level couldn’t make such a mistake.

Piercing through the smoke screen. High Power bullets struck against the barrier one after the other.

“Yami-chan, increase the amount of Psions injected into your CAD!”

While shouting this to Fumiya, Ayako maintained the barrier by pouring an excessive amount of Psions into her own CAD.

Fumiya operated his CAD once again. As per Ayako’s advice, he used twice as much as Psions.

The strength of the signal that returned from a CAD was roughly proportional to the amount of Psions injected in the Activation Sequence. Despite the fact that noise was still mixed in the signal, Fumiya managed to filter it by himself and forcibly executed the magic he wanted to use previously.

The smoke screen cleared up.

The number of enemies had increased to five people. Three were equipped with High Power Rifles, the two that had suffered Fumiya’s attack still had trembling arms but were now pointing towards Ayako and Fumiya some sort of flashlight whose muzzle looked like a trumpet.

Fumiya and Ayako instinctively understood that this cylindrical tool was the reason for their misbehaving CADs.

This was the breakthrough in terms of casting obstruction devices that only the USNA had developed, “Cast Jammer”. Although neither of these two knew about it, their deduction was spot-on.

“Nee-san, leave this place immediately.”

Fumiya ordered Ayako so.

“I’ll report so you come back and get me later!”

“——Understood!”

For a moment, Ayako wanted to object but after thinking about it once more, she nodded to his words. She was aware of the fact that she wasn’t cut out for direct confrontation.

However, she was a beat too late. Fumiya turned away from the enemies at the front. He jumped, not caring about his long skirt, and threw a kick.

The soldier who tried to attack Ayako was thrown back in the air.

“Yami-chan, are you injured!?”

However, Fumiya didn’t come out completely uninjured either. His tights were cut up, blood was trickling down from his foot. The soldier who received the kick had apparently slashed him with his knife.

The material that made up Fumiya’s clothes wasn’t normal, either. It wasn’t on Tatsuya’s combat suit’s level but it was still a high-level protective suit. The knife that the USNA soldier used didn’t seem to be normal metal.

“I’m alright!”

Fumiya landed on his other foot and calmed down Ayako. However, simply judging from the fact that he didn’t land on the injured leg, the damage must’ve been pretty severe. Considering that reinforcements were constantly coming from the air, he didn’t even have the composure to treat his wound.

Ayako ripped off one of her buttons and threw it behind Fumiya.

An intense flash occurred, the movement of the soldier who was about to attack Fumiya was instantly stopped.

With Fumiya’s magic, the soldier fainted.

In the meantime, bullets had constantly been fired at the two.

Ayako had been unable to leave the place. In order to protect Fumiya from the barrage of bullets from High Powered Rifles, she had to maintain her barrier.

If there hadn’t been obstruction from the Cast Jammer, she could have easily used the interval between gunshots to escape with Mock Teleportation. Fumiya, too was badly affected by this, and normally he’d have been able to silence all of them at once. But right now, he had no choice but to use “Direct Pain” on a single target at a time. Neither of these two had the composure to wonder about the strangeness of their enemies.





The enemy purposely only replaced the knocked out members with soldiers.

If more numbers were sent at once, the battle would turn into an even bigger uphill struggle.

Neither Ayako nor Fumiya had noticed this.

Fumiya, in particular, had his hands full with holding his own against reinforced soldiers.

Ayako couldn’t escape, either, because she had to maintain her barrier to be protected from High Power Rifles. First of all, they had to find a way to deal with those.

Just when Fumiya was about to take desperate measures and try his luck, the situation changed drastically. Two gunshots resounded.

The noise that was disturbing the CAD’s functioning suddenly vanished.

“Tatsuya-san!”

Ayako instinctively called out his name.

Near the rooftop’s entrance, Tatsuya stood with his face hid by a helmet.

He was pointing his gun at the soldiers who had been operating the Cast Jammer.



One of the reasons Tatsuya didn’t just jump on the rooftop was that he wanted to avoid making himself an easy target for snipers, but that wasn’t all. He wanted to scatter sleeping gas on the 1st and 2nd floor too.

It was now necessary to abandon the idea of preventing a ruckus but he at least needed to find a way to prevent innocent doctors and nurses from being involved.

The extra time it took for him to scatter the gas capsules in each floor’s corridors made his arrival late, so much so that saying that he was “in the nick of time” wouldn’t be an exaggeration. At the very least, he had arrived in time to prevent Fumiya’s reckless final charge.

Along with the gunshots, the Cast Jammer effect was interrupted.

The gunshots had been nothing but a decoy, in truth, and Tatsuya had used Decomposition on the devices.

The High Power Rifles were turned towards Tatsuya.

Tatsuya did not Decompose them.

The high power bullets were propelled out of their muzzle. Reading their trajectory, he held up his hand.

It was a trick that he had already shown during the 2095 Thesis Competition, but still, it’s effect was undeniable.

The soldier, who mistook this for Tatsuya grabbing with his bare hand the bullets, was petrified.

Tatsuya did not overlook this chance.

With his Decomposition, tiny holes were made in their body armor. The soldiers who had been operating Cast Jammer and the five others rolled on the floor, bleeding from the holes in their stomach.

On the other side of the rooftop, Fumiya mowed down the rest of the opposition with “Direct Pain”.



“You two, are you inju…”

Beginning to say so, Tatsuya frowned behind the helmet’s visor.

He extended his left hand towards Fumiya’s injured foot. The knife wound disappeared in an instant. The cut up tights were also repaired in the process.

After confirming that this was the extent of their injuries, Tatsuya shot the five bodies in the holes created by his earlier Decomposition.

“Umm, what exactly are you…”

With a pale face, Ayako asked the reason for Tatsuya’s cruel deed.

“I want them to think they have been knocked down by a gunshot. Though they’ll probably understand just by looking…”

With what looked like a wry smile, Tatsuya used his knife to stab the enemies Fumiya had defeated.

“They won’t die. If their injuries are treated quickly, then they’ll be saved.”

From the inside of his helmet, an excuse that would do nothing to assuage their conscience came out. This wasn’t an excuse to justify his act, but an excuse to get Fumiya and Ayako’s consent.

“…Are we going to leave them like that?”

Fumiya wasn’t condemning Tatsuya. He was just wondering if they should leave the enemy here.

“These are USNA soldiers. Kidnapping them is probably a bad idea, and moreover, they probably have no clue about Gu Jie anyway.”

“Understood.”

Despite answering so, Fumiya wasn’t entirely convinced. They intervened in his mission despite being soldiers of the USNA, and for him, that meant that they had to have some clue about the whole affair.

However, he could understand why capturing USNA soldiers would be a foolish action.

“Well then, let’s retrieve the enemies that have been knocked down in the hospital.”

“Two Generator corpses are lying down in the 3rd floor’s corridor. I’ll show you the way.”

Nodding to Tatsuya’s proposal, the three of them returned in the building.




“Major Canopus. The obstruction force has been annihilated.”

“Wait until the Yotsuba members withdraw to retrieve them.”

“Understood, sir.”

At that time, in the USNA aircraft that had landed in the base of Zama, such a conversation was taking place.

“Did the car that Heigu boarded manage to escape safely?”

“No pursuing vehicle detected.”

“Good. Keep an eye on it with the satellite.”

“Yes, sir.”

Canopus was currently a step ahead of the Yotsuba regarding the pursuit of Jiedo Heigu. It was all thanks to their intelligence agency. As part of the precautionary measures regarding foreign Magicians, the Psion wave pattern of Gu Jie had been analyzed when he was in their country.

That, coupled with short distance radars that could recognize specific Psion wave patterns, was a technique that Japan didn’t have yet. It was as if the USNA Army had already captured Gu Jie.

However, Canopus wouldn’t move in to restrain Gu Jie’s course of action. He was diligently following the instructions he was given by Colonel Balance.

How to guide Gu Jie to the high seas while obstructing the movements of Japan’s pursuit units? Canopus thought about this for a long time.





Chapter 9




Ever since the US military had interfered in the tracking of Gu Jie the day before yesterday, there had been no progress in the operation. The events of that night gave Tatsuya a great sense of futility. If there was one saving grace, it was that the National Defense Forces didn’t start fighting his comrades. Tatsuya was so disheartened that he plunged into a state in which he had no motivation to participate in the mission anymore.

The issue of USNA troops helping Gu Jie escape had already been reported to Kazama by Maya. She, too, requested for Kazama to look into the situation. However, even though a full day had passed, nothing had been found.

Katsuto, Mayumi and Masaki were the same. Even in the meeting held by Katsuto, nothing noteworthy was brought up. After Tatsuya, omitting specifics, gave his report, other than witness reports in Zama, nothing came up.

Masaki had considered skipping school and devoting all of his time to the mission, especially since he had already changed residences in order to focus on the search. Though, if he were to do that, it would cause his father and Third High’s Principal Maeda to lose face, hence his frustration.

Since losing focus in the middle of an experiment could cause injury, he held his anxiety in, and kept his cool during the lesson. But sitting at the computer terminal, he found himself unable to concentrate. Realizing his current state, he stood up to grab a bite to eat.

The day before yesterday, Masaki had been invited by Honoka to sit at the table with Miyuki. To him, it was an unexpectedly fun time. As though Miyuki had anticipated it, she didn’t show signs of being intimate with Tatsuya. Instead she had spent more time talking to Masaki, seemingly worried.

But today, he didn’t want to show his defeated face to the girl he liked.

Thinking so, as soon as lessons ended, he stood up and left for the canteen alone.

“Ichijou-kun.”

But before he could leave the classroom, a girl’s voice rang out behind him. The two girls standing there were neither Honoka nor Miyuki.

“Please accept this!”

Faster than Masaki could reply, a small box with a ribbon was pushed to the front of his chest.

Reflexively accepting it, before he even had the opportunity to ask “What is this?”, the girls ran off with shrill voices.

“Ah, they ran off!”

“Then, me too!”

Taking advantage of Masaki’s shocked state, other classmates started swarming around him. To be exact, five of them. Like the girls before, they presented neatly wrapped boxes before exiting the classroom.

“Ichijou-san, you sure are famous.”

Masaki heard laughter, and turned around.

There stood three people. Honoka was in front with Shizuku and Miyuki behind her.

Miyuki smiled while looking at the boxes Masaki was carrying.

Masaki felt anxious —— although that feeling was unjustified.

“What is this…?”

Still in a confused state, Masaki directed a shocked face towards Shizuku. His expression was unusually easy to read.

“Today is Valentine’s Day.”

Masaki went rigid. Slowly, he looked down at his hands. There were seven boxes in his hands. Even if he tried to conceal them, he couldn’t.

Although hiding them now would have no meaning, Masaki hadn’t realized the date, and was upset.

“At this rate, it’s likely to increase.”

With a casual word, Miyuki severely beat down Masaki.



He placed the boxes in a carrier bag he received from one of his new male classmates —— even though he hadn’t asked for one and nobody said a word about it —— and placed it beside his desk. Though his original intention was to eat alone, he followed Honoka to the cafeteria.

At this point, Masaki finally noticed the atmosphere in the school. As the anti-magician sentiments had cast a shadow over the students’ hearts, compared to previous years, it was lacking in liveliness. Even then, it was certain that there was a sense of anxiety and anticipation.

“Ah, they’re here, they’re here.”

Recognizing Masaki, Erika smirked.

“Erika, stop that.”

“What? It’s fine. There’s no need for Miki to be jealous of him.”

Though Mikihiko tried to stop Erika with a bitter face, she ignored him completely.

Putting an untouched meal on the table at the seat beside Masaki, Erika quickly asked.

“Ichijou-kun, how many chocolates did you get?”

It would be nice if I could at least put the food in my mouth, thought Masaki. This was because he was in the midst of blowing on his food and was about to eat (his food was hot).

“Chiba-san, what are you saying all of a sudden…”

“Today, when I say chocolates, I’m obviously referring to Valentine’s chocolate right?”

As Erika’s rebuttal was truly only describing her question, Masaki was unable to reply.

“So, how many? I bet on more than single digits.”

“Bet?”

“Oops~”

With Masaki staring at her in shock, Erika hurriedly covered her mouth.

Looking at her happy eyes, it was clear that she felt no guilt whatsoever.

“Such a bet actually happened…? Erika, who are you betting with?”

There was no undertone of finding fault with Erika’s words in Tatsuya’s question.

“I can’t say.”

“I’m no longer a member of the Public Morals Committee, you know?”

“Isn’t the head of the Public Morals Committee here?”

With Erika pointing towards him, Mikihiko, with his left elbow on the table, rubbed his brow and let out a large sigh.

“Tatsuya, Erika…, that is within the jurisdiction of an Autonomous Committee Member.”

“Is that so? But still it’s a secret.”

Erika said as she stuck out her tongue, and once again turned to face Masaki.

“Then, how many were there?”

“The amount doesn’t matter…”

Masaki’s tone was considerably brusque. Probably because he came to understand there was no need to hold back towards Erika.

Anyhow, Masaki had no intention to continue discussing the topic. Even if Miyuki thought nothing about it —— for Masaki to receive chocolates —— the discomfort of him remembering his past fickleness was enough.

“Seven.”

“It was seven.”

But Masaki’s hopes of keeping it secret were instantly dashed.

Honoka and Shizuku both spoke out the number at the same time.

“Eh, seven huh… It’s still high noon. By the time you return home, it will, without a doubt, reach double digits.”

Though Masaki wanted to switch the topic as soon as possible, it wasn’t just Erika who was really getting into the topic.

“Seven? You only just transferred schools; that’s quite impressive.”

Leo nodded in an exaggerated manner. He didn’t look like he had any ill intent but even if there was no ill intent, he couldn’t laugh without causing offense.

“It’s not a transfer. Speaking about it, Saijou, how many did you receive?”

“Me? Zero.”

Having said that, Masaki wasn’t really vexed with Valentine’s Day. He wasn’t that petty. Thus, towards Leo’s unexpected answer, Masaki struggled awkwardly over a reply.

“Still, you sure are composed, huh, Leo.”

“That’s because I have club activities.”

(I’m guessing he’s implying he’ll get some at his club?)

Seeing Tatsuya and Leo converse in such a manner, Masaki felt relieved.

“What are you being so proud about? Anyhow, they’re obligatory chocolates.”

“Says the lonely girl who has no one to pass obligatory chocolates to.”

“Unfortunately, it’s not that I don’t have such people, but that I don’t have the intention to do so.”

“Even if you say that, the end result is still the same.”

“Aren’t you the one being too hopeful on receiving anything?[6]”

…With Leo and Erika arguing, Masaki became flustered yet again.

“Both of you, stop it…”

A tired Mikihiko interjected. At that time, Masaki shared the same equivocal sentiments.




After lessons were over, Tatsuya headed towards the school entrance.

The hunt for Gu Jie was still on, so he was still in the Student Council.

Although it was a “search”, Tatsuya himself had not done much information gathering. Rather, Tatsuya’s job was handling the clues that they had been (illegally) provided via the Perception magic users’ analysis results and their cooperative relationship with the intelligence agency, starting with Yoshimi. If they had no information about Gu Jie’s whereabouts, all they could do was wait.

Since the day the American Military had interfered, they had not been able to obtain any valuable clues. They were well-aware that as time passed, it would become more difficult to capture the target, but rushing around and trying to gather information unsuccessfully had only worn everyone out. There was absolutely no point in any of it. Had today not been Valentine’s Day, he would have been on his way to the Student Council for the first time in a while.

Tatsuya’s gait was a little heavier than normal as he made his way to the school gate, and when he heard running footsteps behind him he stopped.

“Tatsuya-san!”

Honoka had called out to him at almost the exact same moment that Tatsuya turned around to look at her.

Standing behind Honoka was Shizuku. Tatsuya was relieved to see that Honoka had someone with her. Maybe it was mean to Honoka, but he didn’t feel like being alone with her today.

“If it’s not too much trouble, can I have a moment of your time?”

Honoka sounded a little nervous, but she had an unwavering determination in her eyes.

“Should we go somewhere else?”

Tatsuya said in response, rather than nodding his head.

“Err, no, that’s fine, right here is okay.”

Honoka, then, from an antique bag —— a type called a “school bag” from 100 years ago —— produced a flat box that had been wrapped up neatly.

“Please take this!”

They were standing on the single road leading from the school building to the front gate. Tatsuya and the other two weren’t the only students passing by. Now, a few of the other passing students had slowed down to see what was going on as they walked past.

It was not that Honoka had been so nervous that she didn’t notice the circumstances. Rather it was the opposite. She had displayed her determination in front of all the other students watching them.

“Thanks.”

Tatsuya had not refused Honoka.

“But are you sure about this though? You know I’m engaged to Miyuki.”

Tatsuya’s response might have been even more cruel than a rejection.

“It’s fine.”

But Honoka was not discouraged in the slightest.

“I know how it is. That aside, I would be very happy if you would accept these.”

“…I see. Then, I will take them.”

Having been spoken to in such a manner, even Tatsuya had nothing more to say.

“See you tomorrow.”

“Wait a sec.”

Shizuku had called out to Tatsuya, who still had Honoka’s box of chocolates in his hand as he was turning to leave.

“Use this,”

Said Shizuku as she handed a stylish bag to Tatsuya. It was a black-and-white patterned imitation leather bag, shaped similarly to a tote bag, but with an airtight fastener on the opening that made it completely waterproof.

Tatsuya hadn’t brought his bag with him today so he had no place to put the chocolates away, so he was very grateful for Shizuku’s offer.

“Sorry. I’ll be sure to give it back.”

As Tatsuya took Shizuku’s bag, his brow furrowed slightly because the bag was a little heavier than he expected it to be.

When he went to put the wrapped chocolates in the already-opened bag, he realized there was yet another box already inside the bag.

“It’s for you.”

Tatsuya raised his head at the sound of that perfectly-timed voice.

“It’s just a little present, nothing special.”

Shizuku with a mischievous smile.

“Oh, and don’t worry about returning the bag.”

She immediately turned around to hide her blushing face.

A thin smile spread across Tatsuya’s face.

The tension between him and Honoka had been eased by this lighthearted atmosphere.

If it had ended there, it would have been a picture-perfect image of youth.

“Okay, me, too!”

But due to a surprise interloper, the curtain could not be drawn on that scene.

“Eimi?”

Ignoring Honoka’s irritated tone as she called out her name, Eimi ran right up to Tatsuya.

“Here’s a present from me, too!”

The item he was happily handed was a tiny box that fit perfectly in the palm of his hand.

“A, ah…”

Since Tatsuya had taken Shizuku’s “present”, he had no excuse for not accepting this one too.

“Eimi, what about Tomitsuka-kun!?”

Honoka demanded an answer from Eimi.

“I was gonna go give it to him after this!”

Eimi showed not even the slightest hint of timidness or embarrassment.

“You looked like you were about to head home, Shiba-kun. I figured that today was the only day I could give you a present like this.”

Tatsuya was totally indifferent to this.

“Then, I shall as well.”

Subaru stepped out from the shadows of the nearby trees as she said this.

What she handed Tatsuya was not a box but rather a small parcel.

“Ah, I think you already understand, but this is just a present.”

“Of course I understand.”

With a forced smile, Tatsuya accepted the parcel.

Honoka looked like she just didn’t even feel like protesting at this point.

Tatsuya thought that it was surely over now, but…

“Shiba-senpai!”

This time it was a first-year student that called out to him. It was the new girl that had been paired with Minami during the girl’s Shield Down event of the Nine Schools Competition. She was accompanied by her fellow classmates, and Tatsuya’s bag, which he received from Shizuku, was now so full of chocolates that it could not possibly hold anything more.




After his meeting with Katsuto and the others, Tatsuya headed back home once again, and when he arrived, he was greeted by Miyuki sitting with both hands on her knees in the entranceway of the house.

“Welcome home, Onii-sama.”

“Miyuki… What’s going on?”

Miyuki was sitting, wearing a long one-piece dress with a frilled apron on top of it in a manner that looked not unlike the way a Japanese wife would wait for her husband to arrive home. ——Tatsuya felt there was no mistaking that she was sitting that way to block his path.

“Is there something wrong?”

“No… nothing’s wrong.”

Miyuki did not move, so Tatsuya was left standing in the shoe-changing area of the entranceway.

“By the way Onii-sama, it seems like you’ve brought some luggage home with you? If you don’t mind, I’ll put it away for you.”

“As you can see, I have no luggage. …Why are you doing that?”

Miyuki lowered her eyes and hid from Tatsuya’s gaze.

“Well… when you came home from school, it looked like you had luggage with you and I was simply asking.”

Having heard her explanation, Tatsuya finally realized the source of Miyuki’s irritation.

“I didn’t get anything from Saegusa-senpai. She just loves to play pranks.”

The word Tatsuya had said, “pranks” called to mind Mayumi’s prank from last year —— those extremely bitter chocolates —— but he didn’t want to derail the conversation.

“She is the eldest daughter of the Saegusa Family so she doesn’t understand how her actions affect others.”

In response to Tatsuya’s flatly-spoken statement, Miyuki took a small breath.

“You’ve never given Ichijou a gift on Valentine’s Day, right Miyuki?”

Miyuki had never given her classmates or upperclassmen gifts on Valentine’s day. She didn’t like all the fuss involved. But that wasn’t the reason why she didn’t give any gift chocolates to Masaki. The real reason was that she knew that if she gave Masaki chocolates as a gift today, she couldn’t just pass it off as a “gift.” Tatsuya’s words called that to mind and Miyuki understood what Tatsuya was trying to say.

“When Honoka gave me chocolates I clearly reminded her that we are engaged. She still wanted to, so I didn’t say no.”

Miyuki suddenly raised her head, looking wide-eyed and confused.

“That’s…! Onii-sama, that’s a little…”

“Pitiful, right?”

Miyuki looked down again. It was the same position she was in before, but now the atmosphere was different. Her cute, pouty mood was gone now. A heavily strained atmosphere now formed between Miyuki and Tatsuya.

“I know you might feel that I’m pitiful right now. Thinking about Honoka, maybe it would have been better to clearly refuse, but…”

Miyuki stood up without raising her face.

“Onii-sama, you haven’t eaten yet, right? I will go and prepare something now, so please wait in the dining room.”

Ignoring Tatsuya’s self-reflection, Miyuki turned her back to him.



Tatsuya had told them that he would have dinner when he got home, so neither Miyuki nor Minami had had eaten dinner yet. It was a regular pattern for these past few days.

The three of them sat together around the dining table, but the mood was awkward and dinner ended on a somewhat sour note.

“Thanks, it was delicious.”

“She should have refrigerated it first,” thought Tatsuya as they all stood up from the table. He collected his dishes and started to head for the kitchen.

“Sorry, Onii-sama. Can we sit together for just a little while longer?”

Miyuki stopped him with those words.

With a nod, Tatsuya returned to his seat.

Miyuki and Minami exchanged a look, then Minami began to quickly clear the table.

Miyuki produced a large dish covered in a silver cake dome from the refrigerator and brought it to the table.





“To be honest, I don’t know whether it was right or not for you to accept Honoka’s chocolates.”

Miyuki was staring at Tatsuya intently.

“I don’t understand it, so I’m not going to think about it anymore. You may think of me as a cruel girl for this, but I have many other things to worry about.”

Miyuki inhaled sharply. It wasn’t for what she was about to say next, it was to calm herself down.

“If you are going to concern yourself with Honoka, Onii-sama, I ask that you do it in moderation. I really don’t want to have to do something unnecessary.”

With that, Miyuki lifted the cake dome. A powerful bitter scent wafted over the table, teasing Tatsuya’s nose.

It was a simple bitter chocolate whole cake with no fruits or cream on it.

But despite its simplicity, the surface of the cylindrical cake was so perfectly smooth and shiny that there was no way it was made by an amateur.

“Since I went to all the trouble of making it, I was hoping you would try it Onii-sama. Will you accept this Valentine’s chocolate from me?”

Minami placed a plate with a knife and fork on it in front of Tatsuya.

Tatsuya was a little hesitant to take a piece, but he took the knife and made a cut in the cake.

He cut out a 1/6th piece for himself and then placed his fork on his own plate.

“You know, I was actually looking forward to this, too,”

Said Tatsuya as he returned Miyuki’s gaze with a smile.

“I’ll go make some coffee!”

Miyuki stood up daintily and went to the kitchen.

Having turned her back to Tatsuya to face the hand-mill coffee maker, Miyuki’s cheeks were bright red, and her lips trembling uncontrollably.





Chapter 10




For the Magicians dealing with the depressing mood from the aftermath of the terrorism, yesterday’s Valentine’s Day was a long-awaited day for the Magic High School and Magic University students to safely show their feelings.

However, the time they could be intoxicated in such an atmosphere, was only a day.

Friday, February 15th 2097 A.D. What all Magicians, high school students, university students, civilians at large and people related to magic feared, finally come to a head.

No… perhaps it should be said that it had come to start.

At 11 A.M. in the morning, in front of the Magic University main gates.

The demonstration by the anti-magician organization, included plans to break through the university gates with brute force and engage the police there.

As a bank for vast amounts of intelligence pertaining to national defense, entry into the Magic University was already tightly controlled for unrelated personnel. The police stopping the forced entry by demonstrators was not them siding with the magicians but a matter of national policy.

However, the people holding negative sentiments against the Magicians failed to understand this. Or, rather, they did understand but purposely chose to misinterpret the situation. Some of the demonstrators made use of their strength, falling to violence.

Initially, they were knocking against the policemen in groups. Upon being pushed back by the police officers, they intentionally fell down, construing themselves as victims of abuse of authority. Subsequently, what followed was only to be expected.

“Ahh… Those guys, so they’ve finally started.”

Looking at the news displayed on the large screen in the canteen, Leo said this helplessly.

“They’re too much, honestly…”

It’s unclear if it was accidental or planned but after pulling out those over-excited protesters waving the demonstration cards around, even the other protesters started throwing stones at the police officers. Mikihiko frowned upon seeing this. (The road leading up to the Magic University gates didn’t actually have stones, the stones were picked up by demonstrators from the weed-proofing sheet by the tree, then thrown.) The broadcast cut to a live feed of the thugs among the demonstrators being pulled aside.

“…The number of people arrested so far is 24. Is that number large? Or small?”

This question was raised by Masaki, who had joined Tatsuya’s lunch group, since he did not know the situation in the capital.

“Compared to the number from the anti-war protest before, the number is small, but compared to recent events it can be considered on the larger side.”

Tatsuya answered Masaki’s question.

“However, Tatsuya. It looks like the number of people throwing stones compared to before has doubled.”

Without thinking, Honoka interjected. She has, these few days, been very enthusiastic.

“If they wanted to arrest everyone present there, the police would need many more officers there.”

“Even if they can’t arrest them on the spot immediately, the cameras on the streets would have captured them. Hence there’s no need to be anxious, arrests can be made after the fact as well.”

Having relatives who were police officers, as well as having lots of fellow disciples affiliated with the police, Erika followed up on Tatsuya’s comment.

“Eh? Erika, that, is that your brother?”

Zealously watching the news, Leo queried Erika while staring at the screen.

However when everyone’s eyes turned to the screen, the feed had already cut to the reporter.

“Those should be counted as civil law crimes too… Plus it’s a case related to magicians, I’m afraid he was probably called here to deal with the thugs.”

Actually having discovered Toshikazu even earlier than Leo, Erika replied indifferently.

Although not really out of consideration for the brother and sister’s poor relationship, Mikihiko changed the subject.

“Exactly how many people here participated in the protest?”

“Neither the police nor the media has released the numbers…”

As Mizuki said, the government not releasing the number of protestors was already something to be expected for a long time. As for the media, they could have analyzed the pictures taken from above in the air to roughly approximate numbers but perhaps out of consideration for the police, they did not do a report on the total numbers. As for the organizers’ published numbers, nobody would believe them.

“From the pictures on television, it’s probably about 200 people, plus minus.”

“So in total, about 300, 400… It might be more than 500 people.”

In reply to Tatsuya’s estimates, Masaki inferred the scale of the protests before sighing.

“People have the freedom to think for themselves, but despite that, for the side being viewed as enemies, it’s really disheartening to see this.”

“I feel the same.”

Responding to Masaki’s complaints, Miyuki concurred.

In the next second, Erika angrily shouted “What!?”.

On the television feed, lawyers were criticizing the actions of the police in making the arrests.

“What’s with ‘This is encroaching on the freedom of speech’! ‘Freedoms of assembly and association must be respected as well’!? That’s a failed attempt at illegal entry and obstruction of performing of public service!”

“Although I agree with what Erika said… the number of people giving the same excuses as those lawyers is probably substantial.”

Nobody refuted Mikihiko’s ominous prediction.




“Inagaki-kun, are you alright?”

Toshikazu asked with an expression that did not show much concern, “I’m fine.”

Inagaki replied with a dishonest attitude.

In actuality, the news broadcasted yesterday at noon had been purposely cut and edited to become that video.

In the video feed, police officers were suppressing the thugs who were using the demonstration cards as weapons. However, in the midst of that, in order to prevent onlookers from entering the driveway, the police had set up a human wall but were instead beaten up by some thug wielding a blunt instrument.

Perhaps they were trying to rescue their companions who were arrested.

That thug was caught by one of the alert plainclothes police officers mixed in with the crowd of onlookers, it just so happened to be Inagaki.

Because Inagaki had used magic while capturing the thug, the man was still in a state where he could not be questioned.

Hence, his ties to the group of protestors was still unclear until now.

Although it couldn’t be concluded that they were definitely connected.

The assailant with the hidden weapon could have been related to the anti-magic protests, but no one reported as such, yet it could also be seen as not letting the thugs be seen as connected to the protests by viewers.

Such intentions were obvious.

The police officer who was almost assaulted sustained no injuries because of Inagaki. Inagaki, who protected him, however, though luckily not suffering any fractures, had pretty serious bruises left on his hands.

Most importantly, however, injuries of this degree were very common in the Chiba dojo.

Moreover, Inagaki was also one who was able to become the next head’s left and right hand man through his ability. He was only forced to receive the blow with his hands in order to protect the police officer as well as the onlookers around from being hit by the blunt weapon, yet he was able to cleverly dodge in a such a way as to prevent heavy injuries.

From Toshikazu’s perspective, there was some obvious swelling in another spot.

“Eh? Inagaki-kun, was your head hit too?”

Toshikazu, surprised, asked Inagaki who was holding his forehead while frowning. The parts hit by the thug should have only been the wrists. For someone with Inagaki’s level of skill, it was impossible to be hit when catching someone by surprise.

“No, while listening to the police inspector’s story my head started to hurt…”

“You… It seems like you once again need to properly relearn to be respectful to people with a different rank.”

After that short spurt of verbal abuse, Toshikazu said “If you are feeling unwell, it’s fine to go home” while leaving his side. Lately Toshikazu had seen Inagaki perform that gesture of grasping his head many times.

This time, he tried to distract him from it with a joke but Toshikazu truly felt worried for Inagaki.




That night, there was a fairly intense conversation about the incident on the news with both people in favor of and against Magicians. That was not to say that there was a specific program where both pro-magicians and anti-magicians debated each other. On various channels, fairly heated debates started happening.

Carrying on the tradition of using channels in the analogue broadcasting time period, the famous congressman, Kanda, harshly criticized the way the police handled the situation.

[…The demonstrators did go a bit too far, however, it is clear that the police went too far by haphazardly arresting people. The police officers were equipped with both helmets and shields, and were perfectly prepared to defend themselves. Not a single police officer got hurt in the confrontation with the demonstrators.]

[To be fair, one of the police officers in plain clothing received a beating. However, that police officer who did not have anything get broken and only got bruises, retaliated against normal citizens by using magic to attack. That was clearly excessive when taking into account the power of a magician’s attack.]

[I think that police officers should be even more cautious when using magic than when using guns. I am against the use of magic in all situations. I plan to propose a bill to the parliament to increase restrictions on the use of magic and the punishment for it. I want Magicians to first ask for the approval of a superior before being allowed to use magic.]

During the broadcast of the cable and the internet Culture Communication Television Network, Cal-net, Congressman Ueno, who advocated for the rights of Magicians, calmly answered the casts questions who wanted to remove the rights of magicians.

[Since the beginning, the Magic Universities have been severely restricting outsiders from freely coming and going. They deal with a lot of research for the country and important requests for national defense. They did not respond harshly to the anti-magic doctrine demonstrators.]

[The demonstrators did not only swing around metal placards as weapons, but they also threw stones. In that situation, it was likely that not only the students from the Magic University would’ve gotten hurt, the people passing by as well could have gotten hurt. The police cannot evade the claims of negligence when they left the insurgents from the anti-magic doctrine alone previously.]

[Currently there are already strict rules on the use of magic. In this incident, the detectives complied completely with those rules while arresting the perpetrators. On top of that, they had to bind the legs and feet of those people because they interfered with their duty of protecting the safety of citizens. If they had not done that, I think that the citizens could have gotten hurt.]

[It has been scientifically proven that completely overpowering people by way of magic is safer than by using gas or a stun gun. It would be a loss for society if the public were to see magic techniques as the enemy. It is merely superstitious.]

Kouichi had an expression that looked like a teacher who was grading the exam of an average student while watching the broadcast together with Mayumi.

“Only congressman Ueno seems composed. I wondered if he would bring up any more extreme claims.”

While being forced to watch the broadcast together, Mayumi responded with a murmur without trying to hide her displeasure.

“Do you think that Ueno-sensei’s argument is bad?”

Kouichi turned an amused look to his eldest daughter, Mayumi, through his lightly tinted glasses.

“Congressman Kanda is a clown, however, it seems like it’s become more common for the audience to take such exaggerated speakers more seriously. It is the mark of a childish and idiotic know-it-all to decide things from an emotional speech, but the general public conveniently stops thinking and joins in on the surge of emotions. It is a shrewd method, but I think that person can easily deal with the situation.”

“I also think that Ueno-sensei is playing the crowd in a rather lackluster way.”

“He is expected to cool things down, not rile people up. Both parties should try to calm the situation.”

Mayumi frowned after hearing the words of her father who normally did not say anything bad about people.

“What should we do now, father?”

“First, we observe. It was unexpected of Cal-net to be on our side, however, let’s see if they call out that actress this time.”

“That actress? Could it be you are talking about Sawamura Maki-san?”

Mayumi hadn’t heard that her father knew who was backing that performer. Speaking of that prominent actress, it had not occurred to her that Sawamura Maki had visited this house last year in April.

“Yes. I know about her.”

“I don’t really know a lot about her… So, why see if they call out Sawamura Maki-san?”

“She is the daughter of the Culture Communication Network’s chairman.”

“Ah, so it is like that.”

Mayumi responded in a relatively sweet tone to the revelation of her father.



After having watched the same broadcast with the politicians’ performances, Takuma called up Maki.

“Oh, Takuma. Is something the matter?”

Maki seemingly sounded like she had been surprised by the sudden call.

If it had been the Takuma from a year ago, he would’ve probably said something like “Don’t play dumb with me” in an unhappy voice.

However, even if those were still his real feelings, he seemed to be able to hide them now.

“Sorry for calling at this hour. I wanted to give you my thanks.”

“Your thanks?”

While hearing the doubt in her voice, Takuma was able to hear some slight noises in the background.

“If you are in the middle of work right now…”

“I’m in between photoshoots so I don’t mind. So what is it?”

Even though Maki was laughing Takuma did not want to trouble her, so he kept it short.

“Congressman Ueno was on your cable network. The host also seemed quite favorable to Magicians. Was that your doing? I’m honestly thankful.”

“What for something like that?”

Maki let out a disappointed laughing voice.

“It is true that I advised my father to not take an anti-magic stance, but that wasn’t just because of your request, you know. There have been some new developments, and if you don’t keep up with them, you could lose profits. Father is an entrepreneur so he just made some calculations. We also did a favor for Ueno-sensei so you really don’t need to thank me.”

“You still helped me out, I’m truly grateful.”

“Is that so? If that’s the case, then I look forward to you returning the favor.”

“Ah, you can ask me anything.”

Takuma apologized once more for bothering her during work before hanging up.




It might be obvious, but a lot of people were also unhappy because the mass media didn’t take a one-sided stance on anti-magicians.

The fugitive, Gu Jie wasn’t only unhappy, but he was also impatient.

The main goal for his act of terrorism was to entangle the Ten Master Clans and the citizens, changing the public’s opinion so that Magicians would be seen as enemies. Gu Jie also predicted that the Japanese magicians who got cornered by this change in public opinion would evade criticism by using the Ten Master Clans as a scapegoat. His plan was to then use the Ten Master Clans to remove the Yotsuba Family from society.

Dividing the Magicians was certainly effective in creating an opening against the Ten Master Clans, but at the moment, Gu Jie realized that things would quiet down before anything could happen.

“Like this, there is no meaning to it. It is not over until I make those people who have stolen my revenge from me suffer like I did.”

43 years earlier, Gu Jie was driven out of his homeland by a single failure. He, who held great power and fame for an Ancient Magician, lost everything in a short time and got erased socially.

In the middle of his heart being torn by humiliation, Gu Jie swore that he would take revenge.

He wanted to thrust the Magicians of the Kunlunfang Institute era who exiled him into the same wretched circumstances that he experienced and laugh at their grief and resentment.

He couldn’t think of another way to avenge himself.

However, enacting his revenge became impossible. The people whom he wanted to take revenge on were crushed by the Yotsuba.

Having lost the target of his vengeance, having his opportunity stolen, he turned to those responsible.

To banish the Yotsuba from society just like he once was.

“——I won’t kill them. I don’t want to kill them. It would be best if they lived miserably crawling through the mud.”

The suicide bombing attack was the final plan for that purpose.

To deny the usefulness and contribution from the Yotsuba, the Ten Master Clans and all of the Japanese Magicians, to steal their status, their honor and pride from that place.

After he could witness that pitiful sight, he would only want to find a quiet place to die. However, if that plan failed, he wouldn’t concoct another plan. He did not plan to rot while he was bringing his revenge to fruition.

At any rate, he needed to get out of this country at once. He did not have the time to slowly plan for his next attack. Gu Jie was aware that he only had a small amount of time left.

The reason why Gu Jie could continue to escape was thanks to the many connections that Zhou Gongjin, who lived all over the place, had prepared.

Not being able to quickly use Hliðskjálf was a serious wound, however, Gu Jie had always thought that it was dangerous to rely heavily on that tool. He should rely more on his blood companion than that unidentified tool. He reaffirmed that belief yet again.

Time was ticking so he wouldn’t spend time erasing his tracks, and for the purpose of leaving the country as fast as possible, he needed strong pawns under his own control. It wouldn’t do if their potential wasn’t higher than the reinforced magicians he had stolen from the Japanese army.

Gu Jie then remembered that his familiar had carved a seal on a pupil from a magic clan with high potential.

“The person’s character wasn’t an issue, and it seems like it would be fine if that person from that clan became my puppet.”

By using that pupil as bait, he could fish for his teacher. Gu Jie continued working out his plan.




Saturday, February 16th. The Anti-Magic Association held another demonstration today. However, this time, the target wasn’t the Magic University. Their course was heading from the central government agencies to the National Parliament. Unlike yesterday, no one turned violent.

However, that didn’t mean that they did not cause any trouble. There was an incident 400 kilometers west of Tokyo that occurred at Second High in Nishinomiya. Two high schoolers were attacked by anti-magicians on their way back from school.

“Onii-sama?”

“Tatsuya-san?”

Having heard of the incident, Tatsuya returned to First High and was greeted by the surprised voices of Miyuki and Honoka.

“I came back after hearing about the incident at Second High.”

Tatsuya dispelled their questions in a single sentence.

“What are the details of the incident?”

And, moreover, returned a single question.

“The female students were attacked by hoodlums on the way back from school, however, they were safe thanks to other students rushing over to help them. Merely by being repelled, the hoodlums were fairly severely wounded because the students mistook the strength of their magic. By the way, Minami-chan is connecting to the audio conference channel of Second High.”

Just as Miyuki finished her explanation to Tatsuya, Minami reported that she had connected to the line of the president.

Nodding to Minami, Miyuki talked into the microphone.

“First High Student Council President, Shiba Miyuki, here. Second High, can you hear me?”

“Second High Student Council Vice-President, Kudou Minoru, here. I can hear you loud and clear.”

The voice that responded through the speakers belonged to the person with whom they performed a joint operation with last fall at Nara, Kyoto.

“Minoru-kun, you became Second High’s Vice-President, right?”

“Yes, surprisingly, it seems like I became the Vice-President. By the way Miyuki-san, won’t you switch your video connection on?”

“Eh, I don’t mind.”

It was good manners to not start a video meeting from the start. It speaks for itself that suddenly connecting to a camera on the corner of a terminal could sometimes be embarrassing.

Before long the conversation was switched to video after initially having connected by voice. After less than a second, Minoru’s face was reflected on the large screen inside the Student Council Room.

The sound of people taking deep breaths could be heard around the room many times.

The members who did not go on the preliminary inspection or went to the thesis competition saw Minoru’s face. Be that as it may, a beautiful face on par with Miyuki’s from the opposite sex was enough to overwhelm the girls apart from Miyuki.

Minoru lightly opened his eyes because he was surprised after seeing Tatsuya in the Student Council Room of First High. Minoru had heard from his family that Tatsuya was assisting in the search for the terrorists.

However, he knew that it wouldn’t be appropriate to ask him any questions about that now.

“This is sudden, however, Vice-President Kudou.”

Since she was talking to the Student Council of another school, Miyuki used her best tone of voice to ask a question.

“Could you tell me the details of the attack that happened to one of your school’s students?”

“Certainly, President Shiba.”

Minoru also responded in a tone of voice fitting for the Vice-President of Second High.

“About an hour before now on the way from our school to the station, first-year female students from this school got surrounded by 6 men who appeared to be around 20 years old.”

Having heard that story, the members of the Student Council, the Chairman of the Public Morals Committee, as well as a female member from the Public Morals Committee all knitted their brows at the same time.

“The men started preaching ‘Humanism’ doctrine to the girls in a loud voice. ‘Only God is allowed to perform acts of miracles, everything that twists the established natural providence of God is an act of the Devil. Humans must live merely by the power that has been given to them’ they proclaimed.”

Thus, hearing the claims of the religious assailants, it became clear that they were a cult that distorted the ideology of existing religions.

The students repeatedly and firmly asked them to step aside, however, the men did not release them from their encirclement. The students used the crime prevention buzzer on their portable terminal and one of the men then proceeded to try and confiscate her terminal. The situation then turned into a scuffle.

The functionality of the crime prevention buzzer included in the portable terminal is not only limited to letting out a loud sound. It also had the functionality to call the emergency number along with information about their location. It was easy to understand the reason why the men tried to obstruct the use of the buzzer.

“Having heard the disturbance, other students came running over. Three first-year students and one second-year student. The second-year student pushed his way through the wall created by the assailants, and the first-year students followed through the gap he created, then they got into a brawl with the cult followers. Their opponents were larger and on top of that, it seems like they also knew Chinese martial arts. At the moment that the second year student got knocked down, the girls from the first year finished their magic and made the cult followers powerless.”

“How were the injuries?”

“The second-year student’s nose was broken, his eardrum got ruptured, his ribs got cracked and he had internal bleeding in various places in his body. There was also damage to his internal organs, it seems like a fairly serious injury. One male first year student broke his collarbone and another one got a concussion. It seems like he took a blow to the back of his head. No other male or female student seems to have any other injury that stood out.”

“How about their opponents?”

“The magic used was ‘Spark’ and ‘Press’. One person’s pulse became irregular because the effect of ‘Spark’, while another person fell down, hit his head and cut the inside of his mouth, so it seems like he also broke a tooth. The rest got some bruises and scratches from being pushed down by ‘Press’.”

“I heard that the side of the criminals bore serious injuries, however, but isn’t the second year student the one with more serious injuries?”

Minoru showed a slightly bitter smile because of Miyuki’s remark. ——He regained his composure and the bitterness disappeared from his smile.

“The irregular pulse right after having received the magic attack seemed quite severe… Even though I know that some people’s blood pressures easily become irregular, the degree of the damage caused by the electrical attack was unknown before investigating. I think that turned into the story of ‘A severe injury’.”

The reaction of the First High students was separated in those who felt relief and those who let out a bitter smile.

Incidentally, Miyuki was in the group who felt relief and Tatsuya in the group that let out a bitter smile.

“If that is the case, it does not seem like the first year students went too far in their self-defense, right?”

“Now the President and one of the Vice-Presidents are going to the police together with a teacher. I can’t confirm if they know if they will return but it probably shouldn’t be a problem right?”

“Is that so. Well then, could you please inform me of the result when the president comes back? Just sending an email is enough.”

“Understood. I will inform you by email.”

“Please do, Vice-President Kudou.”

“Yes, certainly. Well then President Shiba, no, Miyuki-san. I’ll be taking my leave.”

“Yes. Farewell Minoru-kun.”

Cutting of the television meeting switch, Miyuki turned her head towards Tatsuya.

“Onii-sama, it is as you heard. Like Minoru-kun said, it seems like using magic for self-defense is still a delicate subject.”

“Even if it’s not deemed to be a crime this time, the problem of whether it’s appropriate or not still remains, right? There is no clear standard yet for the degree of magic use that is allowed for varying degrees of danger. Worst case scenario, the use of magic could be altogether forbidden by a judge.”

“Shiba-senpai, isn’t that too unreasonable? If such a ruling were to happen, wouldn’t that mean that in the end, magicians don’t even have the right to defend themselves?”

Izumi rebutted after Tatsuya’s pessimistic prediction.

“It would be fine to use methods of self-defense not involving magic.”

However, when Shizuku presented her hypothesis, Izumi was not able to make a new objection.



Having heard the answers of Minoru, the regular meeting came to a close. After returning home, Tatsuya sat down at the dining table.

“Seeing how much damage was done to both sides, will they realize it was a legitimate case of self-defense?”

“Yes… it’s not clear yet. I feel like Onii-sama’s prediction from earlier really hit the mark.”

Tatsuya and Miyuki both had the same worry. Finding the right criteria to set limits on Magician could lead to a judge outright forbidding the use of magic for self-defense, purely based on his ideological standpoint.

“…I think it would require some time to request clearly written rules about using magic as self-defense through the Magic Association. Assuming that it would be granted.”

With regards to existing laws, removing the cases where the use of magic was allowed for the duties of government officials and civilians who acted as agents for official business, it was actually fairly ambiguous. If there was a situation where there was an urgent need for the public good, the interpretation of the wording becomes quite broad.

That is, historically, when magicians have been used as a tool by the government. the government had freely used magic to preserve public order and quell disasters, and thus the regulations were fairly equivocal.

However, this time, it would become clear if it was insufficient to protect a single magician.

If Magicians hadn’t become a tool for the country, chaos could have very well taken hold by this juncture.

“It is not certain that First High’s students won’t be targeted. Minami.”

“Yes, Tatsuya-sama.”

Minami who stood in the kitchen entered the dining room after Tatsuya called out to her.

“Minami, when I’m not close to Miyuki, try to do as many things together with her, if possible. Try to not leave her side even more than you have been before.”

“Yes.”

“From now on, try not to receive any magical attacks and don’t use any magic that would injure your opponents. Also avoid ‘Reflection’.”

“However, Tatsuya-sama. Even ‘Isolation’ reflects the strength of an attack to the original caster. Using it together with ‘Deceleration’ with my amount of magic power will lower the duration of my shield remarkably.”

Alongside Minami’s objection, Miyuki came to help.

“Onii-sama. What if I take charge of ‘Deceleration’?”

However, Tatsuya’s reaction was not positive.

“No… In that situation your magic power would erode Minami’s shield. You would also be splitting your concentration between the control of my seal. In that situation, small adjustments would be difficult right?”

“That is… I don’t deny that.”

Miyuki responded disappointedly.

“Anyways, being the next Head of the Yotsuba Family, it would be bad if you used magic on civilians. Leave everything to Minami.”

Watching Miyuki nod, Tatsuya returned his gaze to Minami.

“If a situation occurs where it seems that Miyuki will be attacked, wherever you are, I will come dashing over as fast as I can. Therefore, just try and hold out until I get there.”

“Understood. I will leave it to you, Tatsuya-sama.”

Honestly speaking, the difficulty of Tatsuya’s request was fairly high.

However, above maid work, the protection of Miyuki was more important.

Minami nodded resolutely to Tatsuya.




——Despite it finally being Sunday, I had to meet that annoying guy in the morning—— Thought Erika as she returned from her long run. Just then, her older brother, Toshikazu, was going out and she met him by the gate.

It did not seem like Toshikazu was going out to play. He was in his work clothes, a coat and a suit. However, Erika did not think this was suspicious. It was not an exaggeration to say that the work of a detective didn’t stop on a Sunday. Or, at least, the detectives affiliated with the Chiba Family all felt that way.

Without saying anything or looking at him, she tried to sneak past him.

“Erika.”

Nevertheless, she was still stopped just as she had anticipated.

Erika didn’t like this brother who was from another mother. And, thus, wasn’t also good at dealing with her father.

She still remembered being knocked down time and time again until she couldn’t stand up again from her childhood during practice.

She got irritated remembering the various times where she got ridiculed in a joking voice. It was frustrating to her that his words accurately revealed the hidden thoughts in her heart.

Wishing it wasn’t such a thorn in her heart, Erika wondered what he needed from her. Since becoming a high school student, she had abandoned trying to reconcile things.

“What is it?”

The most Erika could do was to look at him with a pouting face.

“There’s something I want you to listen to.”

However, the usual sarcasm didn’t come.

“So, what is it?”

She still thought her tone of voice was angry but her pouting face disappeared while she answered the question.

Toshikazu was not concerned by Erika’s rebellious attitude. He felt like he didn’t have the time to mind because it was different every time.

“You haven’t seen Inagaki?”

“Inagaki-san?”

Because of the unexpected question, Erika unintentionally thought about it seriously.

“…I haven’t seen him lately. What timeframe are you looking for?”

“From yesterday to now.”

“Yesterday?”

Erika frowned because she didn’t understand Toshikazu’s intention. Is there a reason to worry about a healthy adult who hasn’t shown up for a day?

Toshikazu averted his gaze after Erika turned to him with a strange look, sensing his discomfort.

“After that guy took the day off yesterday I haven’t been able to contact him.”

Having sensed the need for an excuse, he explained uncomfortably while turning away.





“Inagaki lives alone right? couldn’t he have suddenly fallen ill?”

“He also isn’t at home. Where on earth could he be loitering around…”

“…You even went over to his house.”

Toshikazu turned his back to Erika’s quip.

“A-Anyways! If you see Inagaki contact me, as soon as possible and also inform my colleagues.”

Colleagues, that is to say, the students of the Chiba doujou.

Toshikazu quickly left Erika behind as she mumbled “Well, that’s fine but…”.



After a little while, Erika had taken a shower and finished eating dinner, then she entered the dojo.

Neither her father nor older sister were inside. Erika had aimed for this opportunity to train without them in the dojo. The sisters had a different mother and a bad relationship, living perfectly isolated from each other even within the Chiba Family.

Even though it was Sunday morning, there were a lot of students practicing. In the center, were young men in their twenties. Veterans from the same generation as Inagaki could also be seen.

Having suddenly remembered her talk with Toshikazu, Erika went closer to them to have them listen to the story.

“Naitou-san, Kadota-san, do you have a minute?”

Erika asked the two while one was swinging a wooden sword and the other was giving advice.

“Oh, Erika-san, good morning.”

“Ah, you came Erika-san.”

Having heard her call out, the two people stopped practice swinging and looked at Erika.

“So why I called out to you… the two of you both joined around the same time as Inagaki-san, right?”

“Yeah.”

“Although, Inagaki-san is still a bit older.”

“That doesn’t change anything, right.”

After Erika emphasized an age difference of only two years, Kadota gave her a cold look.

However quickly realizing she was not making any progress, she changed her mind.

“Well then, it seems like Inagaki-san has been missing since yesterday, so have you two heard anything?”

“Missing?”

Naitou who was the same age as Inagaki and probably the closest to Inagaki in the dojo, frowned his eyebrows in doubt.

“Hmm, that’s weird. From his character I wouldn’t think that there would be a task so urgent that he wouldn’t even leave a message behind.”

“Inagaki-san isn’t as methodical as Naitou-san.”

With a thump, a fairly harsh sound resounded from Kadota’s head.

“…Stop joking around.”

“I am just glad I didn’t get hit by the wooden sword.”

“Yeah, yeah, leave the playfulness out of this.”

Erika turned unamused eyes to Kadota who, in spite of getting hit on the head by a fairly powerful strike from Naitou’s fist, didn’t show a lot of pain.

“So, the both of you don’t know anything right?”

“We don’t. …Attention!”

After Naitou turned his head that looked towards Erika he yelled towards the center of the doujou in a loud voice.

“Raise your hand if you have seen Inagaki today or yesterday!”

No one lifted their hand.

“No one knows where Inagaki is!?”

This time, two young men passed twenty lifted their hands.

“I haven’t seen him yesterday, however, the day before yesterday I saw him around my home town.”

After he said that, other people nodded as well.

“You guys live in Kamakura right?”

“Yeah.”

“It seemed like he was looking for something. I thought he was doing an investigation so I didn’t call out to him.”

“You didn’t notice anything else?”

“I only glanced at him… Sorry.”

Naitou turned to Erika.

Erika returned a nod to Naitou.

“Got it. Resume practice!”

Removing his gaze from the students who resumed practice and simultaneously yelled out “Yes!”, Naitou turned his body back towards Erika.

“It is as you have heard. My apologies that we weren’t of much use.”

“You don’t need to apologize to me. Originally, it was brother’s task. Naitou, please confer the contents of this conversation to my brother.”

Saying that, Erika left Naitou and Kadota.

Knowing very well that Erika had trouble dealing with her brother, Toshikazu, Naitou agreed with a smile.



Having been contacted by Naitou, Toshikazu got into his undercover patrol car without even entering the temporary investigation headquarters.

He called out Kamakura and flashed his lights.

While at the same time, his feeling of regret slowly rose.

The house of the Ancient Magician who explained corpse control magic that they went to together was in Kamakura.

Just before that, Toshikazu received a warning from Fujibayashi. That Ancient Magician was a person under surveillance of the Magic Association. It was rumored that he was friends with former magicians from Dahan.

There were signs as well. After hearing that Magician’s story, Inagaki had unnaturally held his head many times.

I fear that the Magician, “Doll Maker,” used an Oumi Kazukiyo technique. It was probably a type of mind control magic.

Why did I fail to notice the symptoms that Fujibayashi had told me about in Inagaki?

Toshikazu tried to resist the impulse to verbally abuse himself by biting hard on his teeth but some sound still escaped from his mouth.

Toshikazu stopped his undercover patrol car one block from the “Doll Maker” Magician’s residence and erased his presence before going to the front of the building.

It was not to the degree of Ono Haruka, the counselor of First High with the nickname “Phantom,” however, Toshikazu’s hiding technique was also first class. It was an easy feat to fool the passerby’s while holding a sword cane in his hand. He could not deceive machines, however, if it were fellow humans, he had complete confidence that he could easily stay hidden.

While Toshikazu was erasing his presence, he extended his perception beyond his five senses to the inside of the residence. His magic didn’t cover the target like a cloth, but acted more like countless threads radiating and extending from him.

Against his expectations, there was nothing hindering him. There was no isolation wall to cut off the thread nor was there a special lineage trap that would take advantage of the threads to counterattack. Nevertheless, he continued searching deeper inside the residence without becoming careless.

He quickly found the presence of Inagaki.

Toshikazu remembered to be more careful because it went a bit too easily.

However, he soon pushed away that worry from the corners of his consciousness.

The presence of Inagaki that returned from the thread seemed like he was on the brink of death, and terribly weak. Even when not eating or drinking anything for a full day, he seemed to have weakened way too much. It seemed like it would be a race against time.

There was no time to be worried. Toshikazu instantly abandoned regular procedures.

——Even if he was mistaken, he would just write his letter of resignation—— Becoming serious, Toshikazu decided to enter the residence.

To start with, he peacefully rang the intercom. He couldn’t simply meekly open the door, but he was thinking of a pretext to break the lock.

Toshikazu was getting riled up to do that however, “Ow, the police officer from a few days ago? I opened it with my key, come in.”

Suddenly hearing that reply, he prepared to dodge any questions.

Even though he his sense of foreboding was increasing, he told himself “Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained” and turned the door knob.

The door wasn’t locked.

Toshikazu walked into the entry hall and the hall got illuminated automatically. Nowadays, a gimmick like that wasn’t that unusual because most houses didn’t have windows anymore. Furthermore, it was now the second time that he came here. Toshikazu put on shoes (that were also in the house’s style) and went further down the corridor.

There was an old man wearing a costume with a long stand-up collar waiting for him inside the corridor. From his appearance, you would guess his age to be between 50 years old and 60 years old. His hair was pure white, however his skin was dark with many wrinkles and cracks, however, he did not seem to have any liver spots. From the color of his skin and his looks, it seemed like he originally came from the peninsula of Indochina, thought Toshikazu. In any case, he didn’t look like he was Oumi Kazukiyo.

“Oumi-sensei is out right now, however, he said to let any police agent straight through.”

Said the older person in Japanese while lowering his head. Toshikazu felt like the older person had an English accent.

“Excuse me, who are you?”

Toshikazu was aware of the fact that he asked the question in a fervent manner.

“I am called Guen, an old friend of Oumi-sensei.”

As expected, thought Toshikazu, he seems to be from Vietnam. Provided that it was not a fake name.

“An acquaintance of yours is here.”

“Are you talking about Inagaki?”

Even though he lost his fervor, he did not let his guard down. Toshikazu continued questioning the old man who called himself “Guen” while warning himself to not let lose his wariness.

“Inagaki-san. Oh, right. Oumi-sensei told me about him.”

The old man answered Toshikazu while having his back turned to him and leading the way.

The old man opened the door to the room.

The figure of Inagaki laying down came flying into Toshikazu’s vision.

On top of the bed, weakly, painfully breathing.

“Inagaki!”

Toshikazu’s dashed into the room. Instantly realizing that this put the old man behind him he stopped.

The old man didn’t seem to notice the unnatural behavior of Toshikazu and continued walking towards the side of the bed where Inagaki was sleeping.

Toshikazu made sure he could see both the old man and Inagaki before walking closer.

“What is the meaning of this?”

Toshikazu asked another question while suppressing the anger in his voice and looking down upon the face of the old man.

“Your friend has received a curse.”

“A curse?”

“My apologies. Someone is stealing his life force by using a curse technique.”

“A curse technique you say…?”

Toshikazu was bewildered, however, that was not that surprising.

Toshikazu thought Inagaki had received a magic attack from a “Doll Maker”.

But it seems like in this situation, the “Doll Maker” was giving medical treatment to Inagaki.

“Oumi-sensei found your friend collapsed and brought him to this residence to perform emergency treatment and alleviate the effects of the curse. Due to that, he couldn’t contact you. The telephone line has also become an avenue of attack for curses.”

For the time being, he had a feeling that the old man’s words made sense. However, that was not proof that he spoke the truth. Toshikazu did not hear any inconsistencies.

But it was hard to take a hostile attitude here and be rough to him.

Toshikazu thought about returning to his car so he could call for reinforcements.

However, he wasn’t able to do that.

“Police inspector…”

He was stopped by the weak call of Inagaki.

“Inagaki, you are awake!”

Toshikazu unintentionally put his left hand on top of the bed’s frame.

However his right hand was still free so he could be careful of the old man behind him.

Inagaki’s right hand lightly grasped Toshikazu’s left hand.

However in the next moment, Inagaki’s hand grasped Toshikazu’s wrist with the strength of a vice.

Toshikazu tried to repress his surprise.

The strength was incredible. For having been so weak up until now —— when it looked like he could be mistaken for a deceased person, he was able to put out this amount of strength.

Inagaki’s left hand jumped out from under the futon. In that hand was something that looked like a syringe.

Toshikazu used his right hand to defend against Inagaki’s left hand reflexively.

Right after that, Toshikazu felt a shock on his back with the strength of a stun gun. Not having the strength to turn around, his consciousness fell into the darkness.




The magicians spearheaded by the Ten Master Clans deployed their full strength to find the ringleader of the act of terror in Hakone, and the police were also investigating the whereabouts of the terrorists.

However, it had already been two weeks since the terror incident and the date had changed to February 18th, yet they still had not been able to find the whereabouts of Gu Jie.

They hadn’t been able to find new clues from the dead bodies of the generators obtained in Zama. While the feeling of getting stuck in a stalemate in the investigation started to float around, Tatsuya started to investigate the location of Gu Jie once again.

However, Tatsuya suddenly got a feeling of impending danger while on the way to Kamakura alone on his motorcycle. You might be able to say that he was a guy who could feel it in his bones. Stopping his bike and focusing his eyes on the deep snow, he wasn’t able to find that which had given him that feeling of danger. There was no skill to look into the future.

Nevertheless, following his feeling of uneasiness he turned his bike towards Hachiouji.




There was still a lot of time to go before the school day ended, however, Miyuki went to the front of the nearest station from First High.

“Miyuki-sama, I’m incredibly sorry.”

Minami, who was walking next to her, frequently apologized.

“Haven’t I told you many times that it’s fine? This is also Student Council work so I don’t have any intention to force it on Minami-chan and the others.”

“But even so, Miyuki-senpai, is it really okay for it to be just us.”

Superficially, it seemed like Izumi was apologizing as well, however, she was not able to hide her real intentions.

Miyuki went out along with Izumi and Minami to purchase souvenirs to give to the graduated students. Every year, the souvenirs are ordered from a shop in front of the station. At last year’s appointment Miyuki went alone, but this year going alone wasn’t enough so she brought along two other people.

“Excuse me. We are the members of First High’s Student Council.”

“Yes, please come in.”

The person who came out to receive them from within the shop wasn’t the shopkeeper, but his wife.

The shop’s side had also learned various things from last year’s negotiations.



“It took quite some time, didn’t it, Miyuki-senpai?”

Having just left the shop, Izumi let out a complaint in a small voice.

Some way or another, a fed up atmosphere drifted around after hearing the complaint coming from an elegant voice.

“Right. However, today’s plans had already roughly been decided so we did our best.”

Miyuki consoled with a smiling face.

“That’s right, Miyuki-senpai, you negotiated wonderfully. As expected of Miyuki-senpai.”

Izumi instantly lifted away the tension.

“It’s not like I think it was to be expected…”

“No, being able to settle that conversation that fast was all thanks to Miyuki’s strength.”

Turning her back on her integrity by having just earlier said that it took quite some time and then saying to Miyuki “That she did it that fast” was Izumi’s default. Of course, attached was the intention to maximize the time she spent with Miyuki.

“Still, it’s wonderful to be that modest.”

Up until now, it had mainly been one person that praised Miyuki.

Miyuki was experienced in ignoring Izumi’s excitement with a smile.

Leaving that aside, the school day would come to an end before long.

Girls generally walked around with various small makeup items so it wasn’t like they left school empty-handed, but It was still necessary to temporarily return to school before going back home.

“Well then, let’s quickly go back to school. It isn’t like we will only barely make it, but we don’t have that much time left over.”

“That’s right.”

“Yes.”

After hearing Miyuki’s remark, both Izumi and Minami nodded in turn and the three of them turned their feet towards First High.

However, after only having walked for 10 minutes the girls had to stop.

In a side street horizontal from the main street that students took to go to and from school, they encountered a group of around 10 men.

Through the cracks of the circle they stood in, they were able to see the boots that First High female students wore.

“What are you guys doing!”

Izumi, who quickly noticed the female students inside the group of people, quickly walked closer and questioned them in a loud voice.

Some people who stood next to the group of people turned around to face her. The men started talking amongst themselves “Hey, that’s the one from the Saegusa Family”, “Do you know that the one behind her she is First High’s Student Council President”. Their voices reached both Miyuki’s and Izumi’s ears.

“Izumi-chan, wait.”

Miyuki, who quickly caught up to Izumi, stopped her by grabbing her arm.

However, Miyuki’s restraint had been too late.

No, the men’s movement had been quick.

Leaving behind the female students that they had been pestering, they crowded around Miyuki’s group.

“What is it, who are you guys!?”

The men did not respond to Izumi’s normal question.

“That’s the ringleader’s daughter from the users of those sinful black arts!”

Except in a violent play, Izumi did not expect to have that line thrown at her.

“Repent!”

After that person loudly shouted that, the other men also called out “Repent!” in unison.

“Pardon?”

“Izumi-chan, wait.”

Izumi, who started flaring up against the men was stopped by Miyuki.

“Only God is allowed to perform acts of miracles, everything that twists the established natural providence of God is an act of the Devil!”

The men recited the verse that they had learned by ear, however, Miyuki took Izumi’s hand and turned back around.

“If you won’t open the path.”

The men who got glared at by Miyuki showed flinched expressions, however, not responding to Miyuki’s words, they once again recited “Repent!” in unison.

“Humans can only use what has been given to humans by God.”

Miyuki also did not want to listen to them anymore.

“If you do not move aside, that would be unlawful confinement. Are you fine with that?”

The guy who looked like the leader stopped the verse he was reciting to threaten the youth in front of him.

“Hey, shut up!”

The man next to the one Miyuki had asked that question to yelled at her.

Miyuki did not pay any attention to the man’s threat.

“Minami-chan.”

“Yes.”

Minami gave a short response to Miyuki’s call. Minami had already finished preparing a magic barrier composed of both “Isolation” and “Deceleration” that just barely did not touch the men.

At that moment, the men did not understand what Minami had done.

Miyuki took out her terminal to ring the crime prevention buzzer.

The man who shouted at Miyuki attempted to grab her terminal with his hands. However, his hands were repelled by Minami’s wall.

They noticed that they could not reach their hands towards the three girls.

“You think it’s good to use magic as you please, do you!”

A voice rose up from the crowd.

“I am merely defending myself against flagrant illegal confinement.”

Miyuki answered in a clear voice to the accusation of the shameless person.

“As a woman, I can feel when my body is in danger.”

She added in a scornful voice.

Izumi turned to the leader with a cold look.

That look was an unbearable provocation for people who did not doubt their own virtue.

“Punish them!”

The leader lifted his right hand up and forcefully brought it down again.

Including both the people to his left and right, a total of four young men stepped forward, pushing out their right fists in front of them.

On their middle finger was a brass ring that was giving off a dull shine.

“Could that be Antinite!?”

Izumi let out a panicked statement.

“Divine punishment!”

As the leader’s order was carried out, Miyuki, Izumi and Minami were attacked by the Cast Jamming noise from the Antinite.

Minami, who was supporting the barrier magic let out a moan.

The shaking wall was surrounded in every direction by the outstretched hands of the men.



(To be Continued in the next volume)





Afterword




The series has already reached its 18th volume. Tatsuya and Miyuki will soon be third-year students. I get the feeling that a lot of goals have become closer. However, lately I am getting more worried that I haven’t had enough time to write episodes and have left plot points unfinished.

…No, it’s probably due to the fact that the finish line is approaching.

First I planned for the arc to have two parts, but this Master Clans Conference Arc has three parts instead. This is because time and time again, I kept thinking, “If I don’t write this”, “and It would be better if I wrote this as well.” For example, in the original plot of this volume, Raymond wasn’t going to appear. However, while I was writing about his different standpoint within the “Seven Sages” and how he differs slightly from the other six, I reconsidered my original idea of only hinting at him and decided to touch on him. While writing, the appearances of Fujibayashi Kyouko and Chiba Toshikazu also increased.

With these small additions piling up, the number of volumes has increased.

Speaking of getting worried about leaving things unfinished, on the other side of the Steeplechase Arc, the encounter that Erika and Leo had keeps getting pulled to the back of my consciousness all the time. I don’t have the intention of writing another side story after this book, but after the Master Clans Conference Arc is over, I think I want to write an extra arc about Leo and Erika.

Even though I say this, it’s not something that I can decide at my own discretion. The only thing currently decided, is that Volume 19 will conclude the “Master Clans Conference Arc”.

I think that the announcement of wanting to deliver the next volume “Master Clans Conference (III)” will be made as soon as possible, I would appreciate your thanks.

Notes




Kamakura (鎌倉市): Is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, about 50 kilometres (31 miles) south-south-west of Tokyo. Although Kamakura proper is today rather small, it is often described in history books as a former de facto capital of Japan as the seat of the Shogunate and of the Regency during the Kamakura Period. Kamakura was designated as a city on November 3, 1939.

Danna-sama: Master

Garçon: Waiter

Tsukkomi: Boke and tsukkomi are loosely equivalent to the roles of “funny man” or “comic” (boke) and “straight man” (tsukkomi) in the comedy duos of western culture. Outside of owarai, boke is sometimes used in common speech as an insult, similar to “idiot” in English, or baka in Japanese.

Casquette: Is French for “cap”.

Translator’s note: Erika referring to club activities.
