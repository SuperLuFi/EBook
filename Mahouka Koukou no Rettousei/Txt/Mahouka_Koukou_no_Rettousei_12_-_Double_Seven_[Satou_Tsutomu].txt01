“By the way, why are you in Tokyo, today? Aren’t you in charge of work in the Kanto region, Fumiya?”

When the word “work” exited Tatsuya’s mouth, Fumiya sat up like he remembered something.

“Actually, I have something to tell Tatsuya-niisan and Miyuki-san.”

As he spoke his eyes flickered to Minami who was standing behind Miyuki awaiting her command.

“Don’t worry about Minami.”

Tatsuya answered the question in that gaze.

“This girl is Sakurai Minami. Miyuki’s Guardian.”

Both Ayako and Fumiya showed naked surprise at Tatsuya’s added explanation.

“Eh, but Miyuki-san…”

“Tatsuya-san, did you quit being Miyuki onee-sama’s Guardian?”

Tatsuya smiled and shook his head to Ayako’s question which she had suddenly interrupted Fumiya to make.

“No, nothing like that. Oba-ue is probably considering various possibilities.”

“So that’s the way it is?”

Ayako examined Minami meaningfully, but Minami kept her eyes cast down and didn’t show any special response.

“Understood. So there should be no problem with the girl staying.”

Before the mood could become awkward, Fumiya resumed his explanation with an “Actually…”.

“Currently, foreign anti-magician forces have been doing some kind of mass media operation.”

Hearing those words, Miyuki just made an “Oh, my!” by widening her eyes slightly.

“From where?”

Tatsuya on the other hand did not show any surprise. At least, no changes could be seen from the outside.

“USNA’s ‘Humanism Agitators’.”

Humanism has arbitrarily decided that magic is an unnatural power for humans, so the movement advocates the expulsion of magicians because it is part of their faith that heaven (or maybe God) has dictated that humans should only live with the natural abilities they have been granted.

“The so-called Humanism Agitators have already infiltrated the nation a long time ago or is that a different group?”

Humanism had widespread influence on the east coast of the North American continent, and even now the number of sympathizers within Japan could not be ignored.

“No, I think they are fundamentally the same. I don’t believe that they have entered a new phase.”

Tatsuya had grasped the “foundation” of Humanism from a certain information source. He had not informed them, but the Yotsuba high command should also have a grasp on who was pulling Humanism’s strings.

“So an anti-magician campaign using the media?”

Of course, he wasn’t asking about that. That would be a confession that he was concealing information himself. Tatsuya switched his mind back to the matter presented in front of his eyes.

“It’s not just the media. Diet members who are part of the opposition party are also secretly taking part.”

Prompted by Tatsuya’s question, Fumiya supplemented his own words.

“On the grounds of defending magicians’ human rights, they are going to first criticize the use of magic in military affairs. Next, they will use the fact that forty percent of the graduates of the national magic university join the military as the basis to spin the fantasy that the magic education system and the military are colluding with each other, and in the third phase of what I recently learned is their plan, they will target First High School which sends the most graduates to the national magic university with an appeal, ‘Save the children from being used by the military’.”

Fumiya wet his throat with tea after his long explanation. When he looked up again, Tatsuya was giving him a look of praise.

The Kuroba family was a branch family of the Yotsuba clan that gathered intelligence. They did not limit themselves to magical means; they used a variety of information gathering methods such as wiretapping, hacking, and traditional human investigation. However, no matter how capable the people and equipment they are paired with, if you did not manage them well then you could not expose a plan concealed within isolated events. By not confining himself to events that already happened, Fumiya had proven that he had mastered how to use the power of the Kuroba organization.

“Fumiya, you have done well to uncover this much, it’s impressive.”

“Um, no… Thank you, Niisan.”

Fumiya who had spoken so much without stopping once had become temporarily incoherent. If you looked closely, you could see his face getting red. If you looked that closely it might seem as if Fumiya had somewhat unusual inclinations, but that would be a misunderstanding. Fumiya was simply happy.

“Fumiya really likes Tatsuya-san.”

Nevertheless, right now Fumiya was with someone who was in the mood to tease him about it even though she understood that.

“Neesan! Don’t say things that can be misconstrued!”

“Oh my, I’m mistaken? You don’t like Tatsuya-san?”

“The way Neesan was putting it had a different meaning!”

“Hmm? I wonder what meaning you heard.”

“That was…”

The thoughts of the trio watching the playful siblings — Tatsuya, Miyuki, and Minami — were in agreement on the point that “the twins sure get along well”, but the looks they displayed all showed different emotions: Tatsuya’s smile had a bitterness to it, Miyuki’s was amused and Minami’s face was apathetic.

Ayako and Fumiya gave them more details after they informed them about the propaganda war First High School was facing then went to a hotel within the city. In the end, they did not reveal their information sources or their information gathering methods, but such things were closely held secrets. Tatsuya did not intend to criticize them for not being “open”. He did not recommend to the pair “It’s late so you should stay here tonight” more than once, so they were both guilty of that.

Besides, even though they had heard nothing about the means or sources for acquiring the information, they understood. Fumiya’s details had included that Saegusa Koichi and Kudou Retsu were conspiring to do something.





Fumiya’s and Ayako’s intelligence gathering abilities were unmistakably impressive and the abilities of the Kuroba organization were probably the most preeminent in the Yotsuba clan. However, the head of the Saegusa clan was not someone they could easily put a tail on. If their opponent was Mayumi then even Ayako might have done it somehow, but Saegusa Koichi was still too much of an adversary for Fumiya and Ayako to take on. Perhaps, this could be intelligence their aunt procured by her unknown method.

—Tatsuya pondered that in bed in his own room lying with his hands folded behind his head on his pillow.

Believing that he might be dancing on the palm of Yotsuba Maya’s hand was not a pleasant feeling, but there was no way he could ignore this. With First High School facing an attack from the media and the politicians under the influence of the anti-magicians in the near future of only a few weeks to less than a month away, knowing was more beneficial than not knowing. While he had these unsatisfactory thoughts, Tatsuya constructed a plan on how they must respond to this.





Chapter 10




The National Magic University was founded on the old Nerima Garrison. On the surface, this land was empty after the expansion of the Asaka Garrison absorbed the Nerima Garrison, however, approving the construction plan for the Magic University also played a part in combining the Nerima and Asaka Garrisons.

With this developmental process, the Magic University shared a close relationship with the military. At least 40% of the Magic University’s graduates chose to pursue a career in the military or related to one. While there was somewhat of a misguided feeling here, once society’s needs for Magicians were taken into account this ceased to feel unnatural. Precisely because of this, one would think that the atmosphere at the university was just as disciplined as that of a military academy – and just as rigid, which was not actually the case. For example, the dress code was entirely up to the students and even the more incredible or casual garb was excused so long as they did not infringe upon any morals. Any warning was only restricted to mutual warnings between students. In various areas, the sense of freedom was even greater here than the magic high schools. That was how Mayumi felt in the past half a month.

Speaking of which, today Mayumi was dressed in a soft, A-style dress that left the shoulders exposed with cardigan sweater with sleeves. The cardigan was thinly knit with large holes and while the dress ran to her knees, the lace only extended 15mm downwards, enough to allow her shins to peek out from the thin stockings. Her wardrobe was far more revealing than a high school uniform, but neither the students nor the faculty sent any disapproving gazes her way.

Currently, she had been asked to come to the buffet. Her presence had been requested by a male student who also happened to be a freshman at the Magic University. In spite of this, it was plain that there wasn’t a hint of anxiety or excitement about her. As for the reason why, that was because the individual who invited Mayumi was someone she was well acquainted with.

Upon arriving at the café, Mayumi suddenly felt a little dizzy, and not because she was feeling unwell. The overwhelming amount of couples present gave a shock to her nervous system. Rather than being frivolous, Mayumi knew that they were all quite serious about their relationships, but that knowledge was little comfort to the single Mayumi. She too bore dreams of love like any normal person. When seeing close couples, ideas like “envy” or “go away” would float across her mind. Naturally, she refused to acknowledge the fact that she would think this way and didn’t plan on any self-reflection, just like most people.

There was also the possibility that this feeling was amplified because the person she was contacting today was in no way, shape or form related to love. In reality, he wasn’t wholly unrelated, but on some level, such a close proximity caused Mayumi to unconsciously expel this possibility beyond her sight.

“Juumonji-kun, sorry for the wait.”

The moment Mayumi opened her mouth to speak, many eyes were drawn to her table. At the Magic University, no one was ignorant of the meaning behind the name “Juumonji”, though many did not know him personally. The expression that graced many an onlooker’s face signified “so that’s Juumonji”.

“Hardly, I just arrived 5 minutes ago.”

He didn’t just arrive, but was here a mere 5 minutes before. Mayumi smiled a bit at these words that were just like Katsuto’s style.

“My apologies for specifically calling you here, Saegusa-san.”

With Katsuto’s response, the number of prying eyes grew even more. Sensible students who had not turned their heads at the name “Juumonji” were unable to sit still when the “Saegusa” name dropped. This year, practically every student knew that Mayumi was attending the Magic University. So long as they were not hermits who renounced the world, no one could ignore the news that Saegusa Mayumi was attending, regardless of gender. –Furthermore, it does need to be said that the male students cared a whole lot more.

As for Mayumi, she ignored the dozens of stares sent her way as if it was perfectly natural as she sat across from her guest.

“Pay it no heed. Juumonji-kun isn’t the type of person to call me if there wasn’t something important to discuss, right?”

Mayumi laughed lightly as she caught Katsuto’s gaze.

“Also, in such a populous place too.”

Mayumi knew of the rumors that cast her as one of the potential marriage candidates for Katsuto. On the surface, their relationship was definitely not what people on the outside believed it to be. In fact, people more in the know about Magicians would actually find that rumor to be preposterous. In truth, the Saegusa and Juumonji Families had discussed this matter. Currently, when compared to the Juumonji Family, it was the Itsuwa Family with their 20-year old head of house that seemed more welcoming to that idea. Setting aside the Juumonji Family for the moment, the Saegusa Family had no plans to put in motion any real union between Mayumi and Katsuto, but the rumors would be correct in terms of the word “candidate”.

Mayumi’s mischievous allusion “in such a populous place” meant that they were feeding the rumor mill. Mayumi was joking of course, but if asked, she would be hard pressed to deny that she never had such an inkling. Once she became a potential candidate for marriage, it was hard to remain just friends even with the person currently in 2nd place.

“I feel that this is far better than intentionally going somewhere no one visits.”

This response could initially be interpreted as “gentlemanly”, but was actually an “obtuse” reply, causing Mayumi to feel that she was the only one who cared. Katsuto wore a casual suit without a tie or any other articles of fashion, so it was easy to tell at first glance that this thought never crossed his mind even at this point. Still, once she thought about such peaceful things, she could only notice the news article flittering across Katsuto’s palm.

“……What an irritating topic.”

On the table, the electronic newspaper was headlined with topics such as “truth behind Military Magicians”, “JSDF using youths as weapons”, “JSDF dominated by Magicians”, and “preferential treatment for magic officers”. Extremists on both sides were either blaming the JSDF for using the Magicians or covering for Magicians, but both sides were similar in that they censured the connection between the JSDF and Magicians.

“While pretending to act as civil rights advocates for Magicians, they are actually trying to discriminate Magicians from society. Don’t you think such hypocritical news is incredibly vile?”

Katsuto didn’t respond to Mayumi’s complaints and smoothly began operating the cellphone-shaped CAD he removed from his belt.

Carrying CADs was not forbidden on the Magic University’s campus and the standards around magic use were also more relaxed when compared to the streets. Especially dangerous magic was blacklisted and prohibited from use in the labs and experimental offices, while a large number of magic was allowed in general areas that had nothing to do with research labs or experimental rooms. Right now, the soundproof area of effect magic that Katsuto was constructing was also allowed on school grounds.

“Is it something that important?”

Needless to say, a soundproof barrier was needed for private talks, but there was no secret between Mayumi and Katsuto that they feared would be overheard. Even so, a quick glance at Katsuto’s expression confirmed that the subject matter was not something that could be solved by normal conversation.

“Since the beginning of the week, anti-magic sentiment has been on the rise in the news.”

As he said this, Katsuto used the filter on the electronic newspaper to display the articles he was talking about.

“I concur.”

Katsuto eyed Mayumi as she replied back with a serious expression.

“And, what of it?”

Seeing those serious eyes that could appropriately be described as solemn, Mayumi asked without any attempt at a joking manner.

“The reason why the media has taken two stances is because each has a different sponsor.”

“So there are two forces behind them?”

“As you know, we, the Juumonji Family, are not adept at gathering intelligence.”

Katsuto didn’t directly respond to Mayumi’s question, but his words hinted that what he was about to say next was the result of the investigation from the Juumonji Family.

“I have no concrete proof for what I’m about to say, but neither is it entirely groundless. I pray that you will remain calm and listen to me.”

“Of course. Let’s hear it.”

Realizing that this was not going to be a pleasant topic for her, Mayumi subconsciously straightened herself.

“Of the two dialogues, the backers of the group blaming the JSDF might very well be the Saegusa Family.”

“Wha……!”

However, the news that came from Katsuto’s mouth surpassed Mayumi’s tolerance level.

“There may be other conspirators as well, but at the very least, the Saegusa Family plays a large role.”

“That’s impossible!”

Mayumi slammed her hands on the table and jumped to her feet. Thanks to the soundproof barrier, no one was able to hear her voice from the outside, but that magic was unable to block the light, so Mayumi’s sudden elevation to her feet drew a lot of stares from across the café. Seeing the astounded looks coming from all around her, Mayumi sat down in shame. Nonetheless, Mayumi raised her eyes after taking a seat and stared directly at Katsuto.

“It’s true that my father is a strategist who likes to plot behind the scenes, so it is true that even as his daughter, I am not always aware of what he’s doing.”

Her eyes were burning with a flame that was enough to repel the pressure of Katsuto’s gaze.

“Yet, no matter what the reason, he will never forget his duty as a member of the Ten Master Clans. He definitely wouldn’t do something that would bring misfortune to the Japanese magical community.”

After receiving Mayumi’s heated words, Katsuto quietly replied back.

“Then, Saegusa-sama must believe that this must be beneficial to the Japanese magical community.”

There was the sound of a heavy weight dropping and reverberating in the depths of her consciousness.

“Don’t be ridiculous. Everything they talk about will end with……”

As she said this, Mayumi pointed at the news article on the table surface.

“A better world where Magicians have disappeared. Did you think that this blatantly obvious jibe at protecting the human rights of Magicians would be enough to fool my father? Even if it’s Juumonji-kun, I cannot ignore this level of slander.”

“I never planned to offend.”

Katsuto’s reply to Mayumi, who stood there with her teeth clenched in fury, was devoid of any excuses. Feeling the powerful confidence behind his attitude, Mayumi’s head slightly cooled down.

“So you’re saying that above the discrimination against Magicians, there is an ulterior motive in action?”

“As to what that is exactly, I have no idea. The only thing I do know is that Saegusa-sama appears to be engaged in media activity that runs counter to the Ten Master Clans.”

Mayumi pinned Katsuto with a particularly fierce gaze.

That gaze failed to conjure any faltering in Katsuto’s eyes.

“……Fine then, Katsuto-kun. Do you have any plans tonight?”

“No.”

“Then please come to my house. Whether it is truly as Juumonji-kun said, I hope you will make your decision after directly asking my father.”

“I understand. In doing this, you actually help me quite a bit.”




Even if they were the Ten Master Clans that represented Japanese Magicians, that did not meant that they were famous lineages that went back several hundred years. Normally, visiting the home of a college friend did not require a specific appointment with the family. However, Katsuto and Mayumi had come today specifically to see the head of the Saegusa Family, Saegusa Koichi. As the acting head of the Juumonji-Family, Katsuto’s request to see Koichi was granted after setting 8pm in the evening as the designated time.

Wednesday, April 18th, 7:59pm. A pitch black limousine stopped before the threshold of the Saegusa household. From the backseat, a giant of a young man dressed in a formal suit with a tie opened the door himself and disembarked. The reason why the young man appeared colossal was the overwhelming personality he carried that did not befit his age. A special existence even among students who graduated from high school recently, he was the acting head of the Juumonji Family, Juumonji Katsuto.

The one who greeted him was the eldest daughter in the Saegusa Family, Saegusa Mayumi. Wearing a darkly colored formal gown that extended to her ankles, Mayumi curtseyed to Katsuto before showing him the way. At precisely 8pm, Katsuto set foot in the Saegusa household.



“Your investigation was very thorough.”

After conversing with Katsuto in the guest room, Saegusa Koichi readily admitted to the inquiry regarding whether he was one of the backers behind the anti-Magician media inciters.

“Otou-sama! What have you done!?”

Faced with her brazen father nodding his head, Mayumi furiously reprimanded him.

“Relax, Mayumi. Why are you so excited?”

Earnestly tilting his head at his daughter’s vibrant reaction, Koichi calmly scolded Mayumi.

“How can you tell me to relax!? What Otou-sama has done is blatant betrayal to the Ten Master Clans, no, to the Japanese magic community as a whole!”

Perfectly calm, Koichi easily took in the stern gaze leveled at him by his own daughter, who had leaped from her seat on the sofa.

“This is no betrayal. Mayumi, you’re thinking in the wrong direction.”

“What is—”

“Saegusa.”

Mayumi wanted to keep pressing her father, but was halted by the still seated Katsuto by her side. Recalling that they were not the only two people sitting here, Mayumi reluctantly closed her mouth and took a seat.

“Saegusa-san.”

Sensing that Mayumi had regained her composure, Katsuto looked towards Koichi.

“I do not know what you are thinking, so I hope you are willing to explain yourself.”

Koichi slightly bent forward at the waist to look upon Katsuto.

“Is this a request from the Juumonji Family?”

“As a question leveled by the Juumonji Family.”

Koichi allowed his forward posture to relax along the back of the seat before lightly heaving a long sigh.

“As we are both of the Ten Master Clans, I will honestly answer the question the Juumonji Family has for the Saegusa Family.”

Koichi adopted the same proper posture, devoid of panic, that Katsuto had.

“First, in order to dispel any misconceptions, I will first declare that this propaganda was started by foreign anti-magic forces. Not only have they provided information to the media, they have made funds available as well.”

“In the form of investing in the media?”

“The reasons may be as donations or marketing, though the ostensible purpose can be whatever they deem fit.”

In regards to the question Katsuto posed, Koichi serenely replied back in full confidence. In terms of acting behind the scenes, Koichi was far above Katsuto. Katsuto also realized that there was no point in asking about unnecessary details.

“So Saegusa-sama intervened in the media as a countermeasure?”

“Katsuto-kun, do you know the most effective way to counter ‘public opinion’?”

At Koichi suddenly adopting a pedantic tone, Katsuto showed no hint of answering. He was aware that Koichi’s question was rhetorical.

“In the first place, ‘public opinion’ is both an opinion and a judgment. That is, something that someone said and someone accepted. Opinion belongs to the one who came up with it, just as the originator must bear the responsibility.”

There was no way to tell whether Koichi’s change in tone was intentional. The difference in age between Koichi and Katsuto, the head of house for one of the Ten Master Clans and the acting head who was only the son of the current head. Taking into account all these differences, Koichi’s tone was not lecturing, but more of a natural turn of events.

“Once the ‘source’ behind the opinion is known, then refuting it becomes easy. Direct your questions towards that individual, find the gaps in their logic, and cause them to acknowledge their error. There is also the possibility of a compromise where both sides point out the lacking areas lurking in each other’s arguments.”

This was why Mayumi was the only one who wore a furious expression at Koichi’s high and mighty tone whereas Katsuto didn’t find anything out of place.

“This is why refuting ‘public opinion’ is so difficult. If pressed for a reason, it is because there is no opponent to counter when it comes to public opinion.”

This was the same even though Katsuto found Koichi’s words to be quite tedious.

“Even if public opinion is just an opinion, the moment someone says it, their advantages and disadvantages become revealed. However, the ones who came up with this opinion are ‘citizens’ and the ones who hide behind this ‘public opinion’ never take the stage. The media only reflects the citizens’ wishes, activists present the citizens’ demands, and politicians open their mouths to adhere to their citizens’ opinions. When someone says it, their stance and purpose become revealed. Nevertheless, under unclear circumstances, acting as the spokesperson of public opinion and describing the opinions of the originator grants them immunity to the duty of taking any hits.”

Still, Katsuto began to suspect Koichi’s true intent after he beat around the bush so long.

“Public opinion also contains a side that benefits whoever strikes first.”

There was a possibility that Katsuto’s dire view of Koichi was painted all over his face. Koichi smiled slightly as his tone returned to a more polite, gentle one.

“The first public opinion to achieve majority becomes justice at that time and place to bring pressure on the dissenters. Even if the dissenters have logic on their side, even if public opinion is rife with childish holes, logic is unable to stand against a flawed public opinion. As for the reason why, that is because public opinion is not equipped with someone to hold a discussion with, so no discourse could be reached.”

“So you’re saying that the anti-magic supporters are ‘striking first’, Otou-sama?”

Mayumi wore a displeased look while obediently listening to all this before finally interjecting in an agitated voice.

“The seeds of anti-magic sentiment were sown over a year ago. They saw through the fact that we were unable to act against them on that stage.”

Casually handling his daughter’s impulsivity, Koichi immediately turned his eyes back to Katsuto.

“Countering public opinion would achieve little. So, Katsuto-kun, how would you act against public opinion?”

“Scattering their opinion would do.”

Without puzzling over it or being overly theatrical, Katsuto replied back in a frank manner. Even if it wasn’t him, anyone reared to carry the burdens of the Ten Master Clans would logically arrive at an answer. This was not the only answer nor the absolute answer, but a possibly correct answer.

“Correct.”

Everyone knew that this was not the one true answer, though Koichi continued to lecture.

“Simply agreeing with the basics of the aforementioned public opinion removes the possibility of being hunted as an infidel. Then, small differences in dogma will easily cause public opinion to unravel. A scattered public opinion will then lose its momentum and ultimately become forgotten. So long as there is no one who holds the course, of course.”

“Doesn’t that run counter to Saegusa-sama’s definition of public opinion?”

Hearing Katsuto’s point, Koichi smiled in satisfaction before nodding.

“It is as you have said, Katsuto-kun. So long as he continues to obscure himself, there is no way to maintain public opinion’s lost momentum. Even if he continues to hide himself, once he tries to reignite the flames of public opinion, the citizens will see through him and bite back. That’s because the public contains the foolishness to be manipulated once, but the wisdom to prevent the same trick from succeeding twice.”

“So that’s why you intentionally changed the direction of the public’s ire while conducting anti-magic propaganda.”

“That’s just a vent, Katsuto-kun. There is nothing we can do about people with no talent being jealous of those who have talent. That is the same when it comes to magic. Trying to suppress aroused envy even once with whips or candy is impossible. The only thing that can be done is to allow them to vent somewhere. Before they coalesce into an inferno, scattering the sparks into numerous small fires is a much easier way to prevent a catastrophe.”

Koichi finally closed his mouth. Although unwilling to accept his words, Mayumi wore a conflicted expression because she was unable to counter his words. Whereas Katsuto,

“Compared to an inferno, a small spark is preferable. I do agree that might be true.”

After speaking in a solemn voice, Katsuto turned a fiery gaze on Koichi.

“However, there are still people who lose their lives because of small fires. If the individual, scattered sparks are not put out in time, then the small sparks are no longer small and may very well become an inferno that devours lives.”

“That is a hypothetical situation.”

“The pot calls the kettle black.”

After crossing gazes with Koichi, Katsuto rose upon seeing that his opponent was not going to speak any further.

“Elder Saegusa.”

Using the title exclusively used at the clan meetings between two equals, Katsuto called out to Koichi.

“The Juumonji Family deeply regrets the Saegusa Family’s actions in regard to the media and petitions that you immediately cease and desist any anti-Magician propaganda.”

“The Saegusa Family requests that the Juumonji Family deliver their protest in writing. A reply will be prepared after an official protest has been made.”

Koichi also stood and slightly raised his head to look at Katsuto before replying.

“I understand. When I return home, I will get them to agree with me.”

“I am sorry that you came all this way out here today. Mayumi, see Juumonji-sama out. Carefully see him to the door.”

Katsuto silently bowed to Koichi, to which Koichi just as silently returned. Mayumi hurriedly moved in front of Katsuto as he was about to turn around and led him to the threshold.



When Mayumi returned from seeing Katsuto to the door, Koichi was still in the guest room. With a stern expression on her face, Mayumi stood before her father where he was relaxing on the sofa.

“Well, Mayumi. Come, sit. There’s no need to be polite.”

Seeing Koichi leisurely lean back on the sofa with one foot on top of the other, Mayumi sat down without saying a word.

“I more or less know what you want to say…… But you might as well say it anyway.”

“Much like Otou-sama thought, I believe that Juumonji-kun’s opinion makes sense.”

Seeing the intense emotions warring with the steely determination in her eyes while his daughter maintained her decorous self-control, Koichi smiled and nodded.

“It is only to be expected that you would think this way. After all, Katsuto-kun and I were only speaking superficially just now.”

Hearing her father’s bravado, Mayumi’s hands tightened their grasp.

“So there’s more than meets the eye.”

“You didn’t understand? Katsuto-kun seems to have noticed already.”

Mayumi slightly shook her head and hid her discontented, teeth-clenched face from Koichi’s vision.

“As expected, Katsuto-kun has much higher tolerance than Hirofumi-kun.”

Hirofumi referred to the oldest son of the Itsuwa Family, “Itsuwa Hirofumi”. The Itsuwa Family wished for Mayumi to marry Hirofumi. Koichi had intended to compare Hirofumi with Katsuto, but fortunately such words never reached Mayumi’s ears.

“Mayumi, Elder Kudou is already aware of this. Mister did not disapprove of my plan.”

In place of the murmurs that didn’t reach her ears, Koichi dropped a bomb into his daughter’s ears.

“Sensei, he……?”

As Koichi had planned, Mayumi was befuddled into silence, but Mayumi was not about to go away so meekly.

“I have no idea what is on sensei’s mind. What I do know is that playing with the lives of people who are of the same country and are also Magicians is wrong.”

Seeing his daughter’s unexpected feistiness, Koichi was not feigning but honestly surprised.

“This will only last a month at most. I have no plans to allow this to develop to such a point that it could impact daily life.”

“Even if it’s a merely a month, a week, it can still bring about a permanent mark on someone’s heart. Maliciously wielding a pen can leave a far deeper mark than the wound left behind by a sword…… I believe the pen is mightier than the sword, and that is not just restricted to positive strength.”

The normal Mayumi would have bowed out long ago. Seeing this sterner attitude that did not befit his daughter’s style, a question suddenly floated across Koichi’s mind.

“Mayumi, on whose behalf are you so angry for?”

“Eh……?”

Although this was a spur of the moment question, it had delivered a surprisingly telling blow against Mayumi.

“Is this for Katsuto-kun? Or is it for someone among your underclassmen at First High?”

“I didn’t……”

Even Kudou Retsu’s name was not enough to cower Mayumi, and yet, here she was, wavering to the point that she trembled with terror.





Chapter 11




The wave of anti-magician sentiment in the world grew stronger on a daily basis, but a school is something like a self-governing fiefdom. It doesn’t have the independence of an extraterritoriality, but it is unmistakably, to a certain extent, an isolated society. Inside the grounds of First High, tranquility was also preserved. Nevertheless, Tatsuya had been certain that this was the calm before the storm since he had heard Fumiya’s story.

April 19th, Thursday night. At last, the announcement of when the storm would arrive traversed the phone lines to reach Tatsuya.

[Tatsuya-san, thank you for your hospitality to us so well the other day despite the suddenness of our visit.]

“You’re welcome.”

Even though she called it hospitality, all they had done was set out tea and snacks. Tatsuya knew Ayako was using polite phrasing when she said that, but he wasn’t one for exchanging flattery and protestations of humility.

“More importantly, what kind of news do you have for me today?”

[Tatsuya-san, wouldn’t it be nice if we chatted for a while?]

“Next time.”

Should she be angry or shocked - the two looks fluctuated on Ayako’s face but in the end she chose to be resigned.

[Well… That’s fine for today. Certainly, I have important news to impart.]

“Let me hear it.”

Tatsuya’s mind was concentrated on the “important matter” even before he spoke. Being examined by a gaze strong enough to cross the screens, no, it was strong enough to cross the open space between them, made Ayako avert her eyes in shame.

[About the matter you heard about from Fumiya the other day, the schedule has been essentially set.]

Nevertheless, the embarrassed Ayako steadfastly did her duty. Concerning such things, Ayako was not the frivolous girl she appeared to be.

[On April 25th, Wednesday of next week, a member of the national diet will visit First High for an inspection.]

“The Civil Rights Party’s congressman Kanda?”

[That’s right. Good guesswork.]

“Isn’t it rather a lack of unpredictability.”

Congressman Kanda, a young politician and a member of the civil rights’ branch of the opposition party which was well known to be extremely critical of the national defense force, had rapidly received increased media exposure this week. And his words and deeds were being circulated by the media, which, while superficially pro-magician at a glance, was actually for the exclusion of magicians from the military, which anyone who paid it a little serious attention understood.

[That’s true.]

Perhaps because she thought Tatsuya’s point was only natural, Ayako chuckled as she smiled.

[So that Congressman Kanda will invade First High with his usual entourage of reporters.]

“What will he do when he invades?”

[Who knows, I haven’t thought that far.]

“So he hasn’t prepared some big trick.”

Tatsuya didn’t even bother pretending to consider Ayako’s behavior and simply nodded with an understanding look.

[I think you might be interpreting this in some kind of twisted way……]

This conversation was being held between Tatsuya and Ayako only. Miyuki wasn’t near Tatsuya and Fumiya wasn’t next to Ayako. Perhaps because she was so relaxed over not being watched, Ayako looked flabbergasted in a way that was appropriate for her young age.

“If something large scale was prepared for that stage, there’s no way you wouldn’t know, Ayako, right?”

[……I accept your words of praise.]

“You’ve been praised, so enough of that.”

While he summed it all up in those words, Ayako barely managed to give a cool reply (at least she thought it was); however, as could be expected of Tatsuya, he took up the chase more seriously, making her genuinely at a loss for words.

[Tatsuya-san……are you perhaps doing this knowingly?]

“What?”

[You are such a……no, enough.]

Apparently Ayako was making a show of being hounded but the girl swallowed the words she was going to say, faced with the poker face with no hint of emotion peeping out from it as if it was an iron wall. And also for the reason that she finally remembered that she had not made the call for that purpose.

[As you have said Tatsuya-san, I don’t know what they are going to do with that too large of a stage. Maybe, it’s the usual performance, right. However, the journalists who accompany him are going to be many times the norm so he probably intends to make a big fuss.]

“I see, that seems to be it.”

At this point, Tatsuya appeared to have sunk into thought in front of his second cousin for the first time that evening; however, that was only for about five seconds. Tatsuya returned his gaze to Ayako and gave her a slight smile of thanks.

“Thank you for contacting me. The information is worth considering.”

[I will look forward to you displaying your skills.]

Tatsuya responded to Ayako’s affectation with a smile and after the polite niceties, the call was ended by her.




The following day, April 20th, Friday. Tatsuya called Azusa and Isori to the student council room before class started.

“Eh, that’s a very serious matter!”

When she heard about opposition party Congressman Kanda’s inspection, Azusa stood up kicking her chair, raising her voice in distress.

“……Is it something to get that upset about?”

Sticking to Isori like glue as usual, Kanon presented the question “aren’t you going overboard”.

“No, this is a grave situation, Kanon.”

Isori rebuked his betrothed’s optimism.

“If you look superficially, Congressman Kanda appears to advocate for magician’s rights. However, his arbitrary reasoning is that magicians being inducted into the military is decidedly wrong; beneath the surface is his concealed intention to obstruct the relations between magicians and the military.”

“Even I understand that somewhat. But Kanda’s target this time is the relationship between the military and education, right? Not us.”

Perhaps, Kanon disliked Isori siding with Azusa and Tatsuya and not herself. She directed a slightly displeased look at Isori as she answered.

“Even if it damages our freedom?”

Kanon’s face made an “eh?” at Isori’s retort. Kanon still had not hit upon what Isori was worrying about.

“If the people who believe that the practical application of magicians by the military should be stopped take power, they will certainly prohibit both magic high school students like us from choosing to enroll in the defense college upon graduation and graduates of the magic university from joining the military as well.”

“You mean they’d employ thought control.”

Kanon asked with a look of disbelief to which Isori turned his head away from so he could close his eyes. This was not a rejection of her spoken question, he was rejecting the look on her face when she asked the question.

“Fundamentally the principle of pacifism doesn’t even accept the analysis that defensive armaments are needed to deal with military threats to one’s own nation. They’ll suppress freedom of speech by forbidding slightly positive assertions about the existence of the army. For that purpose not even violent measures would be forbidden. To them, there is probably no reason to hesitate using thought control on us. While they preach about the human rights of magicians, they take away a magician’s right to choose their own employment without concern.”

It was an unexpectedly wicked diatribe. Since Kanon who should know Isori better than anyone else seemed somewhat daunted, it might be natural for Tatsuya to feel surprised. Perhaps, Isori had some kind of bad memories about the “fundamental principles of pacifism”.

“……For that reason, we can’t pretend that it is someone else’s concern, Kanon. So, Shiba-kun, how do you intend to resist them?”

Perhaps even himself feeling that he had gone a little overboard, Isori changed the topic with an awkwardly amiable smile.

“You called us here because you had some kind of idea, right?”

“Yes.”

Tatsuya gave a brief answer to Isori, and turned around to exchange a look with Miyuki. From the time Azusa and the rest had come, Miyuki had been hanging back behind Tatsuya’s back, but now she passed the electronic blackboard she had been carrying in her hand over to Azusa and Isori. Tatsuya saw their gazes drop onto the electronic blackboard and immediately began his explanation.

“They are condemning Magic High Schools as sites of military education and claiming that the schools are directing students into military related fields. So then, wouldn’t it be great to show that the fruits of magic education are more than things related to military purposes?”

Tatsuya spoke in a frank tone anticipating the conclusion. No one responded to his words with sounds of comprehension, objections or questions.

“So I thought we would want to hold a slightly showy demonstration that coincides with Congressman Kanda’s visit to the school.”

“…Slightly?”

“…This?”

Azusa and Isori finally made these responses. Their shocked faces were an indirect form of protest. However, their voices did not express their shock as well as the looks on their faces so it gave off a superficial impression.

“It will need large-scale preparations, but the demo itself wouldn’t be all that different from normal electrical discharge experiments, implosion experiments and the like. The outward appearance is superior, though.”

“Maybe we could only make a show of it.”

Although Azusa protested in a weak voice, Tatsuya’s wry smile with which he was enduring this did not change.

“If we made something only similar in appearance the meaning would be quite different… And so this would be eminently effective. But, Shiba-kun…”

Perhaps he finally got over the shock, Isori after vocally persuading himself to agree gave Tatsuya a somber look.

“Can you really do it? One of the Three Great Puzzles of Weight Systemic Magic, The Gravity Control-Type Magic Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor.”

Isori’s questioning of the most essential part of the plan made Tatsuya make a slightly hesitant face.

“I can’t make the actual thing yet.”

However, this did not indicate a lack of confidence regarding the practicality, he was pondering how he should answer the question.

“I did not say an experimental reactor. Not in the form of an reactor. But, we can produce something with the potential to implement nuclear fusion in a showier and more easily understood way than the thesis we did for last year’s competition.”

“……A ‘stellar furnace’?”

Azusa, who had never taken her eyes off the electronic blackboard throughout the conversation, murmured that, still in the same posture.

“The Gravity Control-Type Magic Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor. I think this concept is the opposite of Suzune-san’s proposal of an intermittent style of nuclear fusion.”

Azusa was staring at the electronic blackboard as if boring into it; she didn’t look at either Tatsuya’s face or Isori’s face.

“The quantity of energy that it is capable of producing per unit of time is incomparably larger than Suzune’s system…… If Shiba-kun’s stellar furnace is implemented, there will be no distinction between day and night, it would be possible to supply energy that is unaffected by the influence of weather conditions. Factories also could operate without worrying about the electrical supply and it would put an end to fear of another radical temperature drop. There is probably no other demonstration superior to this for showing magic’s use for peaceful purposes.”

Azusa broke off her monologue-like whispering and turned to face Tatsuya.

“Is this an original plan of yours, Shiba-kun?”

“It’s not a unique idea in by any means, but certainly, this is something I am working to create. The method is still far from practical since the magic skill level needed is so high, but if our school’s students have the ability and if it’s for a short period of time, then there is potential to operate an experimental reactor.”

As Tatsuya answered Azusa’s question, he nodded firmly and deliberately. It was like he was saying the Gravity Control-Type Magic Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor was the summit of his ambitions. The stellar furnace was nothing more than the main component for realizing his own original goal, but at this point of time, Tatsuya did not intend to make that obvious.

“Is that so…… understood.”

Azusa also returned his nod with uncharacteristic boldness. Tatsuya hadn’t told them everything; however, his feelings about making the stellar furnace a reality were genuine. And, Azusa sensed Tatsuya’s sincerity and nodded.

“Isori-kun.”

Azusa turned to face Isori.

“I wish to cooperate with Shiba-kun’s plan. How about you, Isori-kun?”

“I will also cooperate. A public stellar furnace experiment. Not just a countermeasure to Congressman Kanda; as someone aiming to be a magic engineer, I am all for doing it.”

As he answered Azusa, Isori also nodded his head up and down.



On the noon break of that day, Tatsuya went to the staff room to visit Professor Jennifer Smith. To hold experiments not in the course curriculum, a written application must be submitted; if it is part of club activities then to the club adviser, if it is an independent experiment not part of club activities then to the class teacher, if there is no class teacher due to being in the second course then to the staff room; no experiments are allowed without the school’s permission.

When Jennifer looked at the list of magics to be used at the beginning of the written application, she suddenly raised her eyebrows.

“Gravity Control, Coulomb Force Control, Four Phase Shift, Gamma Ray Filter, and a Neutron Barrier? Shiba-kun, do you intend to do a high output laser cannon experiment?”

“I do not intend to do something like that.”

Tatsuya artlessly replied to his professor’s question in a traditional style. There was no need to give his answer a strange aspect, but perhaps his choice of a cliché phrase that he didn’t have to think about was due to the sheer unexpectedness of the question. While he compiled the list of magic combinations he had offered, he had not been aware of the potential for their use to complete a laser device that uses a nuclear fusion reactor until Jennifer had pointed it out to him.

However, Jennifer was not even listening to Tatsuya’s answer, so they might be even. Her question had been a kind of a monologue; Jennifer’s eyes were glued to the written application.

“The subject of the experiment is extremely ambitious……”

Jennifer looked up from the electronic paper displaying the written application and turned her eyes to Tatsuya who was standing to the side.

“Can you guarantee the safety?”

“According to my calculations, I can guarantee it.”

Tatsuya’s answer could be thought of as irresponsible, but Jennifer did not chide him about it. It was the role of an experiment to determine whether a theoretical possibility was an actual possibility. “Stopping an experiment because it was unknown whether it was actually safe” was in a sense putting the cart before the horse. She was a scientist who wouldn’t have anything to do with that kind of foolishness.

“In this school’s presentation at last year’s Thesis Competition, a proton to proton chain reaction was used to avoid exposure to neutron radiation. Why does this experiment use a heavy hydrogen reaction?”

Of course, that did not mean she did not consider the risks. That risks should be minimized by calculations was something Jennifer naturally kept in mind.

It goes without saying that Tatsuya also considered that point. There was no hesitation in his answer.

“The conditions for using the original proton to proton chain reaction were too strict for the energy source. The techniques in Ichihara-senpai’s experiment were likely to guarantee the successful control of the reaction, but if the utility of the energy reactor is taken into account, I believe the returns are too little to justify the investment of the techniques. Besides, with the proton to proton chain reaction, the danger of exposure to radiation is only slight if the neutrons don’t break out.”

Jennifer silently considered Tatsuya’s answer for a while with her arms crossed.

“……Understood. I cannot give permission at my own discretion. The written application will circulate. A decision should be made by the end of the schoolday.”

“Thank you. Furthermore, please keep the experiment secret from outsiders.”

Tatsuya had not thought that he would receive immediate approval to use the radiation experiment room and the campus. After a few additional last words, Tatsuya bowed a goodbye to Jennifer.



“So, did you get permission for the experiment?”

After school in the Student council room. Tatsuya, who was posed this question by Azusa, offered the written application with the principal’s electronic signature stored on it that had been sent to him.

“A condition has been attached, but it was approved.”

“Condition?”

Hearing Isori’s question to Tatsuya, Azusa looked up from the electronic paper displaying the written application.

“It’s only natural, a teacher will supervise. That is the condition.”

“I see. So, which teacher will work with us?”

Just as Isori was asking for a more detailed answer from Tatsuya, the chime rang signaling a visitor.

“Tsuzura-sensei. He has thoughtfully come here for the meeting.”

Miyuki, who checked the monitor, turned around to answer Isori.

Izumi promptly stood up. She didn’t seem the least bit energetic; however, as the only first year among upperclassmen, it was proper for her to go to the door to greet Professor Tsuzura.

Student council activities temporarily ceased with the coming of Tsuzura. Izumi, who was in the middle of training in student council procedures, also stopped her hands and went to the table for the meeting. Tsuzura sat down in the seat the student council president usually sat in, and the student council room quickly changed into the experiment meeting room. Of course, Tatsuya, who had planned this experiment, had also planned on helpers beyond the student council members here. He had asked them to meet him here without telling them the reason.

“I’ve gone over the protocol for the experiment. I think it’s an interesting approach.”

After moistening his throat with the tea Pixie served, Tsuzura was the first to speak up at the meeting.

“So, Shiba-kun. Have you considered who to assign to which duty?”

What he meant by duty assignments was who would perform which magic. The magic that was to be used in this: Gravity Control, Coulomb Force Control, Four Phase Movement, Gamma Ray Filter, Neutron Barrier.

“First, I want Mitsui-san to take charge of the Gamma Ray Filter.”

“Me!?”

Abruptly designated, Honoka spoke out hysterically. She hadn’t even heard the particulars of the experiment until this stage, so it was understandable.

“In magic involving controlling the frequency of electromagnetic waves, I know of no one who is superior to you, Honoka. Won’t you undertake it?”

“I understand! I will do my best!”

Nevertheless, in the end, Honoka, after hearing no more than Tatsuya’s “please”, nodded her head in agreement. Considering her feelings, this was probably fairly inevitable.

“Isori-senpai, please take Coulomb Force Control.”

Perhaps they had already discussed this, as Isori just silently nodded.

“For Neutron Barrier, there is a first year I know of, I think she can take care of this.”

At this statement of Tatsuya’s, Izumi’s face twitched.

“A first year? Is that okay?”

The unease was probably insuppressible even for Tsuzura. It felt like he interrupted without thinking.

“Yes. The girl possesses genius level talent for barrier magic against objects.”

“Who is it?”

“Her name is Sakurai Minami. My cousin.”

“I see.”

However, hearing Tatsuya’s explanation, Tsuzura relaxed to his former posture with a relieved look. Tatsuya thought Tsuzura changed his attitude a little too easily. Maybe, it wasn’t because she was his cousin that Tsuzura’s worries eased; Tsuzura was probably confident because she was Miyuki’s cousin, Tatsuya extrapolated.

“I haven’t determined who to ask to handle the Four Phase Movement, yet. And, I believe my sister will handle the necessary Gravity Control.”

At the same time as Tatsuya said that, Miyuki made a small seated bow.

“I believe that is a suitable personnel selection.”

This time, Tsuzura’s face showed understanding. Currently, in First High school, the student with the highest level of magic power aside from the third years was Miyuki. Tsuzura naturally knew this.

“With all that done then, the only thing undecided in the first order of business is who to ask to handle the Four Phase Movement.”

As he spoke, Tsuzura turned his eyes to Azusa.

“Is there any impediment for Nakajou-san?”

The one who replied to Tsuzura’s suggestion was Tatsuya, not Azusa herself.

“I believe the president should oversee the overall operation.”

“I see. Certainly, that would be appropriate.”

Withdrawing his own suggestion, Tsuzura once again looked lost in thought. At that point, Izumi raised her hand.

“Umm, is it all right if that task were left to us?”

This proposal should have been something unanticipated, but, without letting what was going on in the back of his mind show, Tatsuya asked in a businesslike tone.

“By us, do you mean the two of you, Kasumi and yourself?”

“Yes, I might not have enough power myself to do it, but if Kasumi-chan and I do it together, I think we would surely be useful.”

Listening to Izumi’s words were the other six people (Tsuzura, Azusa, Isori, Tatsuya, Miyuki, Honoka) here, among whom four had a puzzled look on their faces.

“……I can understand Tsuzura-sensei knowing, but I didn’t think even Shiba-senpai would know.”

Naturally, Izumi herself felt having doubts was more natural, so she had not expected to be easily accepted. There was no way an upperclassman who had been chosen as an engineer for the Nine Schools Competition and as a representative to the Thesis Competition would not know what it meant for two people to be in charge of one sequence. Furthermore, he had not shown any surprise. There could be no other reason than that he knew of the scope of their power.

“Let’s go into that topic at another opportunity. Such an opportunity might never come though.”

Tatsuya easily sloughed off Izumi’s searching stare to look at the model of the experiment reflected on the screen in the surface of the wall.

“Tsuzura-sensei, Mitsui-san, and Saegusa-san do not know the particulars of the experiment. So I thought going through the explanation would also confirm the details.”

With Tsuzura’s agreement, Tatsuya went over the details of the experiment with the student council members. Azusa, Isori, and Miyuki already knew the contents but no one looked bored.

“……The stellar furnace system from a technical point of view is still underdeveloped. However, if we cooperate and function as a team, then without a doubt we can succeed in this experiment concerning what is one of the so-called three great problems.”

At last he summed it all up and Tatsuya’s “stellar furnace” was turned into a small stunt.




The stellar furnace experiment’s actual preparation period was from April 21st to April 24th, a four day period. If the time spent crafting the experimental devices for the Thesis Competition is considered then it was a hopelessly insufficient period. However, this time there was not going to be a full school mobilization. In the first place, Tatsuya and the others were not supposed to know of Congressman Kanda’s forthcoming inspection. This experiment must appear unrelated to the visit of Congressman Kanda and the media. It wasn’t necessary to conceal the Stellar Furnace experiment itself, but it was temporarily confined to volunteer accomplices and the student council officers.

However, from the start Tatsuya and Miyuki hadn’t been pessimistic about the situation. As he had said to Isori, this time they were not going to build the structure of an energy reactor. They were only going to display the structure. This experiment was fundamentally a performance: they were not constructing actually functioning experimental devices like they did for the thesis competition. Tatsuya was very conscious of the difference. On the other hand, Miyuki could not look on anything Tatsuya attempted pessimistically.

The preparations steadily advanced to the goal and begun to look like the real thing, and the faces of the other participants in the experiment began to look less impatient. From the face of Kasumi, who seriously worked on the experiment determined not to do less with her efforts than that darn Miyuki with a frowning expression that all but said she was unwilling as well; from the face of Hirakawa Chiaki, whose attitude displayed the question, “how did this happen?”, but never let her hands rest for a second either; and from the face of Tomitsuka, who had innocently dragged in Chiaki with good intentions and whose face went back and forth from letting his unease disappear to looking resistant. —Among them was a silver haired first year who had intended to only gaze at his hero, Tatsuya, but whose whole body spoke of his delight at helping; Sumisu Kento had managed to slip in despite being an outsider.

And April 24th, Tuesday. After school the day before the main event, in the radiation experiment room, the final rehearsal was being held. A 50% heavy water and 50% light water mixture had been poured into the globe shaped water tank made from a highly transparent, pressure resistant resin. The large quantity of heavy water had been provided by Tsuzura. It was possible to industrially manufacture heavy water from ordinary sea water, but securing a large quantity of heavy water was of course difficult for a simple high school student. The abundance of heavy water that they were able to get was the result of Tsuzura exercising his connections to the fullest.

“Okay, let’s start. Miyuki.”

“Yes.”

First, Gravity Control magic was invoked.

“Kasumi, Izumi.”

“Four Phase Shift, go.”

The twin sisters spoke as one and executed the Four Phase Shift magic.

“Honoka, Minami.”

“Gamma Ray Filter in effect.”

“Neutron Barrier, in place.”

He did not rely on the girls’ reports; Tatsuya used his own “eye” to confirm that the steps of the experiment had been cleared.

“Miyuki.”

“Focus point established.”

Tatsuya called out Miyuki’s name once again, informing Miyuki that all the preparations were made.

“Isori-senpai.”

“Electromagnetic repulsion force neutralization, start.”

And when the last safety valve was released, the voices of the members in position in front of the gauge fluttered about doing the checklist.

“Degree of Gravitational field Stability, no issues.” “Gamma rays, measurement within safety limits.” “Neutron rays, measurement within safety limits.” “……”

Tatsuya serenely gazed at the first step of his dream while listening to those voices.



The last rehearsal ended well. If this was a simple experiment then they would have been satisfied with the conclusive results they received today. However, this experiment was being held as a demonstration against anti-magician advocates. Tomorrow was the crucial moment. The participants were keeping their expectations quiet as they departed from the experiment room.

Due to Azusa and Isori taking on the cleaning up and closing up, the other participants moved to the student council room. It was nearly time for the gate to close, but maybe they felt they had entered some kind of state of continuous emergency. Tatsuya pondered that. Still, the other participants, Miyuki and Honoka who followed Tatsuya, Izumi, and Minami who followed Miyuki, and Kasumi who followed Izumi, formed a kind of chain. Kasumi and Minami were not members of the student council; however, no one here right now was bothered by that.

“Welcome back.”

Shizuku greeted Tatsuya and the rest. She wasn’t a member of the student council either, but, like the boss of the public morals committee, she frequently used the stairway that connected the student council room and the public morals committee room. From her taciturn exterior, it was hard to imagine that Shizuku actually had a pretty laid back personality. Even so, her sense of responsibility was above average, so, since she was asked to look after things in their absence, she diligently did the duty like this.

“Sorry for making you wait, Shizuku. You really helped us out.”

“Nothing special happened.”

Miyuki’s words of thanks were met by a “don’t worry about it” headshake, and after informing them that nothing unusual happened, Shizuku turned to face her best friend.

“Honoka, about that?”

Instantly, Honoka’s face displayed an “urk……” flinch. Perhaps discerning the answer to her question from merely that, Shizuku just showed an “oh, well” look.

Rising up and moving behind Honoka’s back, Shizuku grabbed both of her friend’s shoulders. Honoka was taller by half a head; however, paying that no mind, Shizuku forcibly changed the direction Honoka’s body was facing, so Honoka was directly opposite Tatsuya facing him head on. Taking her hands off, leaving Honoka there, she looked here and there in the vicinity until she found Honoka’s bag and reached in to get a small box wrapped in pretty paper. Pressing that box into Honoka’s hands, she went behind her friend’s back again to give her a strong shove in the back.

Honoka stopped herself after one step and looked up at Tatsuya’s face that was closer than before. There was still too much space between their positions to enact a love scene. Of course, with this many onlookers, no matter how easy it was for Honoka to constrict her vision, it would be difficult for her to act boldly. The attempt she was going to make was going to be a very innocent occurrence.

“Umm, Tatsuya-san!”

After that statement, Honoka squeezed her eyes shut and offered the box with both hands.

“Today is your birthday, Tatsuya-san!”

Leaving no room for Tatsuya to answer, Honoka continued speaking. She was talking so fast it was doubtful that she was taking the time to breath, but it definitely wasn’t hard to understand what she was saying.

“It’s not much, but I worked hard at picking it out! Please accept it!”

Kasumi’s voice saying something like “Do Mitsui-senpai and Shiba-senpai have that kind of relationship” reached Tatsuya’s ears from a corner of the room, but Honoka undoubtedly didn’t hear her.

“Of course, I will accept it.”

The moment Tatsuya’s hand touched Honoka’s present, he felt not a piercing but a penetrating gaze. However, when he took fleeting sidelong glances behind him, all traces of that sword-like stare had disappeared.

“Thank you.”

“N-No, it’s nothing. Umm, please unwrap it when you’re alone.”

“Hm? Ah, got it.”

Tatsuya nodded with a slightly mystified look and Honoka let out a big sigh. She seemed like she was just about ready to collapse having used up so much of her strength, but fortunately all she did was stumble. Shizuku decided by the “I adore Tatsuya” look on Honoka’s face that she was not up to anything else and took charge from next to Honoka.

“Tatsuya-san, are you free next Sunday?”

As usual, Shizuku suddenly started speaking. Tatsuya was quite used to it, but he couldn’t keep from being instantly confused.

“What time?”

Of course, he was only confused for a moment. And he continued the conversation without missing a beat.

“The evening. Around six o’clock.”

“……That’s fine.”

He had a meeting on developing a completely thought controlled model of CAD on Sunday with FLT’s R&D section three, but six pm in the evening left him plenty of time to return. Neither the main office or R&D section three were in the habit of letting their meetings run over.

“It would be a little late, but I want to hold a birthday party for Tatsuya at my house. Is that okay?”

This “Is that okay?” was packed with three different meanings: “Is it okay to count on your participation?”, “Is it okay to have it at my house?” and “Is it all right that I just went and planned a birthday party for you?”.

“It’s completely fine. Thank you for inviting me.”

There were no ulterior motives beneath Shizuku’s proposal to give Tatsuya a birthday party out of her own good will, he knew that without even checking. Tatsuya nodded without even pretending to think about it and Shizuku answered with a slight nod. While she looked expressionless, there was a slight hint of smugness in the shape of her mouth.

“Miyuki and Minami-chan too.”

Without a moment’s delay she spoke to Miyuki and Minami, needlessly hiding her embarrassment.

“Yes, it’s fine.”

“Thank you for your invitation.”

Unrelated to Miyuki’s smiling answer and Minami’s more diffident answer, Kasumi was looking at Tatsuya with an appraising eye. Kasumi hadn’t thought Tatsuya was the type to be popular with girls, but that mental evaluation was shaken.





Chapter 12




On the way back from school, as the three of them parted from their friends and boarded the Cabinet, Miyuki seemed strangely agitated.

There was nothing noticeable on the surface. Even close friends would probably only wonder “is she considering something?”. But in Tatsuya’s eyes, his sister was fretting considerably. Getting off at the station closest to home, her condition only worsened as they approached the ticket gate.

“Mi-”

“Uhm, Onii-sama.”

At the same time Tatsuya tried to call her name, Miyuki timidly raised her head.

“Ah, what is it?”

Miyuki didn’t reply immediately at Tatsuya’s inquiry, but instead moved aside so as not to block the other passengers and stood still.

“That……well, could, you please accompany me shopping for a little while?”

“I don’t mind at all, but……”

Just what in the world is the matter, Tatsuya swallowed without saying. Miyuki wasn’t the type who enjoyed going out shopping as entertainment on weekdays. If there was something they really needed to buy she’d order it online and it’d arrive the very same day. Besides, she wasn’t asking straightforwardly.

“Minami-chan, sorry but could you go back and prepare dinner yourself?”

“Certainly, Miyuki-neesama. Tatsuya-niisama, I will be going on ahead.”

Without showing any concern towards Miyuki, Minami briskly headed towards the commuter hall. This also invited suspicion. Although not as astute as Tatsuya, Minami should have also perceived Miyuki’s state. If the reason was because Minami was confident in Tatsuya’s abilities as an escort, this would be somewhat understandable. But Tatsuya could not help but feel something was off.



Separated from Minami, Tatsuya led Miyuki towards the nearest cafe. He thought it’d be best to hear her out first.

Entering the store, Miyuki seemed relieved. This further increased Tatsuya’s suspicions. Miyuki had said she wished to shop, but now that they were in the cafe she was for some reason making what seemed like a “mission accomplished” expression.

When the waitress came for their order, Tatsuya had a hot coffee, and Miyuki, under some stress, ordered not a cup, but a pot of tea. It appeared they wouldn’t be leaving the cafe anytime soon. Could it be that Miyuki had simply wanted time alone to talk, Tatsuya wondered.

“Miyuki.”

Increasingly worried, Tatsuya spoke up to Miyuki before their drinks had arrived.

“Yes, Onii-sama.”

Miyuki, as she replied, was her usual self. She smiled happily as she spoke his name. Her distress earlier seemed like a dream. However, just because of that he couldn’t leave matters unsettled.

“Is there something up?”

Tatsuya decided to try the straightforward route.

“Eh, oh no. It’s fine now.”

It seemed Miyuki herself was also aware of her previous state. She shook her head quickly, but Tatsuya perceived there was yet something unmentioned in her heart.

They broke off the conversation when the waitress came with their drinks. Miyuki checked the tea leaves by opening the pot lid, then after closing the lid and waiting a while poured into a small cup. Her careful movements, more polite than necessary, could only be described as gradual.

Miyuki took a small sip of the tea, then wordlessly added half a spoonful of sugar. Twice, three times, four……upon the 20th Tatsuya could keep quiet no longer, and spoke to Miyuki in a coy tone.

“As unlikely as it is, could it be that you took Honoka’s present……”

The spoon clanged as it bounced off the cup.

“Not at all! I would never!”

“Sorry, of course not. I never considered it for an instant. Forgive me.”

As Miyuki desperately denied it with a flushed expression, Tatsuya awkwardly apologized.

“Oh no……I’m not unhappy or mad at all, it’s just I’ve been preoccupied, and……it’s just a complete misunderstanding. So um, Onii-sama, there’s no need to bow your head.”

Now upset, Miyuki appealed to Tatsuya to raise his head. Pushed by her vigor Tatsuya looked up, but the question lingered in his mind. As he said, he had not seriously thought that Miyuki’s consternation was due to jealousy. The reason for her suspicious behavior remained unaccounted for. He decided, however, that pursuing it any further would be awkward and gave up.

Seeing Tatsuya’s unsure expression, Miyuki tilted her head anxiously. As their confused eyes met, they both began to laugh.



After that, they did a bit of window shopping for an hour before heading back. Tatsuya also put Miyuki’s “worries” out of his mind. It wasn’t that he didn’t remember them anymore, but rather he simply didn’t bring it up since she seemed alright again.

Just what had she been suffering. The moment he finished changing and stepped into the dining room, having been called via the communication unit, he found out.

The sound of crackers welcomed him in. A shower of colorful streamers blocked his sight, before falling at his feet.

“Onii-sama, happy birthday!”

Having taken off her uniform jacket leaving only the necktie, Miyuki stood in her one-piece. The dress was sleeveless and pure white, complimenting Miyuki’s slender figure. It was the familiar uniform she wore everyday, yet the impression after removing the jacket was significant. It was like it had been designed for her alone.

Behind Miyuki was Minami in her usual highneck one-piece and apron. Upon the table were the vivid masterful results of her cooking.

“So, you were stalling me for the preparations……”

Tatsuya raised an eye as he looked towards Miyuki. She shrugged nonchalantly as she glanced away.

“Well……I’m really happy. Thank you.”

In short, they had wanted to surprise him. Certainly, this would not have been possible when it had been just the two of them before. It may have seemed slightly childish, but Tatsuya was deeply aware that it had all been for him.

“Onii-sama, please take a seat. We’re waiting on the cake right now.”

As Tatsuya smiled, Miyuki’s face shone as she fired up and busied herself. With a slight look of resignation, Minami approached carrying a cake, inserted candles, placed a knife and fork in front of Tatsuya, and lit the candles before turning the lights off and sitting down.

“Onii-sama, please.”

As he watched Miyuki bustling around, without saying a word, Tatsuya as requested blew out the 17 candles in one breath.



Unexpectedly treated even to Miyuki and Minami’s singing voices, the birthday party ended vibrantly despite only three people being present. He had been dragged along from beginning to end by his sister’s exuberance and even made some noise of his own such as clapping, but now he was relaxing in his room by himself.

Preparing for the experiments tomorrow, it was a good change of pace. His sister had likely thought of that too, Tatsuya thought. He then suddenly remembered that he hadn’t even untied the ribbon from the gift he’d received from Honoka.

He took a long, thin box from his bag. Despite the size, it was rather heavy. Expecting it to be some technological product, he removed the ribbon and carefully peeled off the wrapping paper. What was revealed was a luxurious wooden box. Opening the lid, he saw a spring loaded antique pocket watch.

“Wasn’t this expensive……?”

Muttering subconsciously, when he checked the manufacturer engraved inside he smiled subtly. Carved within was the mark of the corporation run by Shizuku’s father. In other words, this had come from Shizuku.

The back of the lid where a photograph went was empty. Shizuku would most likely have placed a photo of Honoka there, but Honoka herself seemed to have been less than enthusiastic.

Imagining the scene playing out in his head, Tatsuya let out a chuckle.

Through the sound of his laughter, he heard a knock on the door.

“It’s Miyuki. Onii-sama, may I come in?”

Her voice barely reached inside the room, it was so quiet. Whatever her intent, it seemed she didn’t want to disturb their housemate. Tatsuya likewise opened the door silently with this in mind.

His sister stood there resplendent, regally dressed with a touch of makeup. Her one-piece dress was a robe decollete of pale cherry, with plenty of lace and boldly exposing the chest and back. Her flowing black hair had been tied back, revealing her blemishless skin, and its complex combed out form shone against her pearly back. The skirt, which reached her ankles, comprised strips of cloth of different length, and the shape of her flawless legs peeked out from the thigh down. Her charm now was even greater than in the morning when she had awoken him, and he was lost in her beauty for an instant.

“Um, Onii-sama?”





“Ah, sorry. Come in.”

Tatsuya had been entranced by her momentarily. Dazed and blocking the entrance, at Miyuki’s puzzled voice he came to and moved aside, letting her in.

Miyuki had not come empty handed. Her right hand held a bottle, a handbag dangled from her left elbow, and in her left hand were two glasses.

Seeing both her hands full, Tatsuya softly closed the door. Miyuki lightly bent her knees in thanks, then placed the bottle down side by side with the glasses on Tatsuya’s desk.

“Is this Honoka’s present?”

Miyuki spotted the pocket watch still on his desk.

“Yeah.”

“It’s a very elegant design isn’t it?”

“It is.”

Miyuki herself probably held no ill intent, but Tatsuya felt bad somehow, and stowed Honoka’s present away in a drawer.

“So, what’s all this?”

Retrieving a spare chair from the wall storage for Miyuki, then sitting down in front of the desk himself, Tatsuya glanced over the bottle and glasses. Miyuki moved her seat, a wheeled stool without a backrest, next to Tatsuya and sat a distance away, smiling shyly.

“Onii-sama, do you remember April 24th last year……?”

“Of course.”

Her question had absolutely nothing to do with his question, but it seemed that if he didn’t answer this he wouldn’t get an answer himself, so he thought back.

“You suddenly appeared in a kimono.”

He had been stunned then as he was now by this dress — not that he said that aloud.

“Right, that happened too.”

Miyuki murmured as she shifted herself out of sight slightly. She had been earnest back then, but looking back, it seemed even she was embarrassed.

“Uhm besides that……last year, Onii-sama, it was just the two of us.”

“Yeah.”

Just what Miyuki wanted to say, Tatsuya already knew by this stage. As he smiled with love, Miyuki also returned a clear smile.

“The year before, was celebrated with just us two as well.”

“I remember.”

“Minami-chan is with us this year, so we celebrated together but……”

Pausing, Miyuki looked down in embarrassment.

“In the end, I really……want some time alone too. For a little while, could we celebrate Onii-sama’s birthday with just me……?”

Leaning forward in his chair, Tatsuya reached for Miyuki’s face.

His hands brushed her cheek.

Miyuki’s shoulders were trembling.

Gently held in Tatsuya’s hands, Miyuki’s head was brought up.

Their eyes met.

Miyuki’s eyes were moist, and her face red.

Suddenly, she turned away.

To avoid her brother discovering the heat now emanating from her cheeks.

“Onii-sama, a toast?”

“Champagne?”

Tatsuya quietly lowered his hands, but his eyes remained firmly fixed on Miyuki.

“Yes, but it’s alright. There’s barely any alcohol in it.”

“Ah, I’ll open it.”

Perhaps the cork was in tight; Tatsuya took the bottle from Miyuki’s trembling fingers. Deftly removing the cork without sending it flying, he returned the bottle to his sister.

“Thank you……please go ahead.”

She placed a half-filled glass in front of Tatsuya. Pouring into her own glass, Miyuki held it up with her right hand.

Tatsuya took hold of his glass with his left hand, and held it near Miyuki’s.

A clear sound rang out.

“Onii-sama……happy birthday. I’m thankful that Onii-sama is with me.”

“Thanks. I’m thankful that I could be your brother.”

The two of them tilted their glasses at the same time.



On a side note, the present Miyuki had prepared was in the handbag. Within the box was a somewhat oversized locket pendant, exquisitely engraved with motifs of the sun, moon, and stars. A 3D photo of Miyuki in the dress she wore now had been placed inside. Earlier Miyuki had been regretting about “letting Honoka take the initiative”, but in these terms it seemed Miyuki was still in the lead.

—And Tatsuya, unable to fathom his sister’s intentions, worried continually for over an hour.





Chapter 13




Tuesday, April 24th. Today, Shippou Takuma spoke privately with the ally who shared his goal of “a new order”, Sawamura Maki, at the usual time before heading home.

The time was already 2300 hours. In order to avoid troubling people at home (including the servants), he had dined outside and called ahead to inform his family that they didn’t need to wait for him. The servants living at his house should have already turned in for the night, so Takuma slipped in through the backdoor without ringing the doorbell.

“Takuma-san.”

As he was removing his shoes, a young man a few years his senior called out to Takuma.

“Sensei is waiting for you in the study.”

Sensei referred to the head of the Shippou Family, Shippou Takumi. The young man serving as his father’s assistant must have received orders from his father to wait here for Takuma. Despite thinking “how irritating”, Takuma couldn’t ignore this. After replying “Got it” to the young man, Takuma headed for the study.



On the surface, the Shippou Family worked as investment advisors, especially in the field of weather derivative instruments. As a particular type of risk management tool, weather derivative instruments were broadly used to predict atypical weather hazards. As a financial tool, the value of weather derivative instruments was determined by various weather values such as temperature, humidity, condensation, etc. While industrialization of the food industry has decreased the efficacy of weather derivative instruments, the rise of solar energy as the principal provider of electricity in more developed countries has rendered the estimated time for sunshine a major indicator for earnings projections used by corporations. The reason why Shippou Takumi was referred to as “sensei” was because he was publicly acknowledged within the nation to be the authority on annual weather predictions.

However, right now Takuma was facing the head of one of the 18 Replacement Clans, a Magician whose magical prowess rivaled that of the Ten Master Clans, Shippou Takumi.

“Come in.”

This phrase was spoken to Takuma as he entered the study, shortly before he sat on the set of sofas that were separated from the thick, heavy desk that his father used.

Takumi rose from his office table and sat down while facing Takuma.

“Takuma, how’s high school? Are you enjoying it?”

Did you call me here at this hour to talk about this nonsense, that was what Takuma thought on reflex. Though he knew very well that this was just small talk, Takuma’s infuriated emotions were about to eclipse his rationality.

“Father, I should have already said this a countless times before. For me, high school isn’t a place for fun and games.”

In response to his son’s words, Takumi wore a “Seriously?” expression.

“How stubborn you are. There’s no need to overexert yourself to this degree.”

“Father, you’re the one who is too relaxed!”

Seeing Takumi’s placid attitude, Takuma’s agitation finally exploded.

“We obviously only have one more year until the next Ten Master Clans Selection Hearing. At this rate, those Saegusa wallflowers will once again seize our place in the Ten Master Clans while the Shippou will again suffer the indignity of being inferior to them!”

“The Selection Hearing is something that selects 10 families out of 28 families.”

The voice Takumi spoke towards Takuma was interlaced with a sense of futility.

“Fixating only on the Saegusa Family is absolutely pointless. Even you, Takuma, should be aware of that level.”

This was not the first time Takumi said these words. Rather, save for the days that he never interacted with his son, Takumi had the feeling that he said this to his son on a daily basis in the past year.

“There is a point.”

Furthermore, there was never an instance where Takuma came around to his father’s words.

“The Saegusa Family is nothing more than one family among the 28.”

“Those guys are different.”

Today, Takuma’s attitude was as stubborn as ever.

“Takuma.”

“They’re not the same. The Saegusa are different.”

Takumi heaved a sigh filled with exhaustion.

“Who was it who implanted such a deeply rooted obsession in you?”

“It doesn’t matter who it is! It is true that the Saegusa betrayed the name ‘3’ and used the stolen ‘7’ to win their place among the Ten Master Clans!”

“Takuma…… The days where they were the ‘Saegusa (3)[4]’ instead of the ‘Saegusa (7)’ preceded the establishment of the Ten Master Clans. When Sensei proposed the Ten Master Clans system, the Saegusa had already become the ‘Saegusa (7)’. Furthermore, they do indeed possess the strength that towers above others in the 28 families.”

“In terms of the strength that towers above others, that’s only the result of them secretly devouring the research results from the 3rd and 7th Research Labs. Plainly the final experimental body came from the 3rd Research Lab and broke away from the 3rd Research Lab before stealing the ‘Herd Defense’ that was originally conceptualized and developed by the Shippou Family just as we were on the last phase prior to completion entirely for their own benefit. Not only our Shippou Family, but the Mitsuya, Mikazuki, Tanabata, and Nanase Families were all duped by the Saegusa Family! Father, how are you so calm even when this is clearly how the situation was!?”

“Takuma. Like us, the Magicians from the Saegusa Family are also experimental bodies.”

Hearing the sentences uttered by Takumi in such a bitter tone, even the excitable Takuma fell silent.

“They are beings who have been constructed. The only difference is that, unlike the other 27 families…… no, the other 26 families content with their lot as experiments, they have chosen their own path. This is not something to rue, but is instead praiseworthy.”

“……So in essence, Father, you are saying that treachery and stealing a march are praiseworthy things?”

Takuma managed to muster a response.

“Aren’t you trying to steal a march on the Ten Master Clans right now?”

“That’s……!”

However, Takuma’s retort was like a boomerang that missed its target and came back to its thrower.

Before his son, who had fallen silent with a sullen expression on his face, Takumi sighed slightly.

“Forget it. I know you weren’t going to accept this regardless of what I say.”

Takuma’s “accusation” and Takumi’s “persuasion” had not started today. Including this instance, father and son had retread the same conversation several dozen times. In spite of this, they still couldn’t help but argue with one another, which only proved that their bond as father and son could not be sundered.

“I called you here today because I had something else to say.”

“……At such a late hour?”

Takuma threw in as much sarcasm as he could in his response.

“That’s because it was absolutely necessary to tell you this today. Seriously, if I knew you would return so late, I would have arranged a meeting with you beforehand. This way, I could have spoken with you when you returned home from school.”

Nevertheless, this was a self-destructive gesture on Takuma’s part.

“……Sorry.”

“You do not have to apologize to me. However, you do need to ask your mother’s forgiveness. She should still be awake.”

Snap, without trying to hide his expression, Takuma’s eyes drifted all over the place as Takumi cut to the chase.

“Takuma, take the day off from school tomorrow.”

“Father? What are you saying all of a sudden?”

Takuma’s shocked expression was not feigned. He was truly bewildered by his father.

“Tomorrow, Congressman Kanda from the opposition party will be touring First High.”

Takumi had predicted that his son would find this peculiar, so he directly started to explain his reasoning without wasting any time.

“Congressman Kanda from the opposition party, as in Kanda the human rights proponent and anti-magic supporter?”

“Correct. As well as his media underlings.”

“For what reason?”

Even though Takuma asked this, he really already guessed the answer. After taking into account Congressman Kanda’s recent statements that were highly publicized by the media, his purpose behind visiting First High was nigh apparent. Takuma’s question was merely for verification purposes.

“He’s putting on a show about protecting adolescents from being forcibly stripped of their freedoms by magic.”

“Civil rights!?”

Even knowing this, Takuma couldn’t help but spit that out. “No need for you to worry” was written clearly across his face.

“I understand what you’re trying to say, but our opponent is a national congressman. Causing an incident would be very problematic.”

His father’s words caused an irate expression to appear over Takuma’s face for an entirely different reason than before.

“Even if it’s an irritating opponent, I’m not going to pick a fight without paying attention to the consequences. I’m not that childish.”

“Even if they are picking a fight with you?”

“……Uh, of course. Would I be provoked that easily?”

Takumi relaxed and leaned deeply back into the sofa.

“Good. Since you speak so resolutely, then be prepared to bear responsibility for your words.”

“I know that! That’s all you have to say, right?”

Seeing these oft-repeated words and belligerent attitude, even someone other than Takumi would wonder if Takuma was truly “beyond provocation”.

“Takuma, the situation is being handled by Saegusa-sama. Under no circumstances are you to do anything unnecessary.”

Yet, this particular phrase from Takumi was not spoken out of concern for his son’s attitude, but carefully timed instead.

“Saegusa!?”

As expected, Takuma displayed an intense reaction.

“Do not do anything unnecessary. You must bear responsibility for your own words.”

Nonetheless, this was already after they had reached an accord.

“The Shippou Family will not interfere with this incident. You heard me, Takuma. That is the decision.”

It’s not like he could recant after all this,

“—I know!”

So Takuma had no choice but to reply in this fashion.




They were unexpected visitors for practically everyone at First High, though they were probably also unwelcome visitors for everyone affiliated with First High.

Ten men and women disembarked from three pitch black limousines.

They were composed of Congressman Kanda, his secretary, reporters working for the congressman, and bodyguards.

During 4th period, the first class after noon, they suddenly demanded to meet with the principal. Of course, no appointment was made ahead of time. Generally speaking, they would be graciously rebuffed and sent to the door, but the status of a national congressman was such that they were able to do something tyrannical like this. In this regard, things had changed little from the previous century.

With Congressman Kanda wholly ignoring decorum and demanding an audience, the Dean Yaosaka of First High could only greet them with a sour expression on his face.

“Congressman Kanda, I have already said that Principal Momoyama is away on a business trip to Tokyo today. Please, would it be possible for you to come again when the principal is here?”

“Ho. Are you trying to dismiss I, Kanda, like a child and tell me to come again?”

“I dare not dismiss you like a child.”

“Then the dean is fine as well. I wish to view the classes of your illustrious school in action.”

“This is not something I can grant by myself. As I thought, you need to speak directly with the principal.”

Kanda and Yaosaka were both in their fifties. At first glance and with a mind towards television appearances, Kanda appeared to be younger thanks to the efforts of makeup artists and plastic surgeons. However, upon closer inspection, Kanda also carried symptoms that befit his age. Though the two men were of the same age group, the sight of one overbearing side speaking with greater and greater fervor while the other side sweated and fretted away without daring to retaliate made for a hilarious sight despite its rather common frequency.

Speaking of which, Kanda knew from the very beginning that the principal was absent. Rather, it would be more precise to say that he invited himself specifically during the principal’s absence.

The principal of First High, Momoyama Asuma, was 71 years of age. Since taking over as First High’s principal until now, a full 11 years had elapsed. To the outside world, he was widely known for contributing greatly to the establishment of higher education for Magicians. However, at the same time, he was also criticized for neglecting the differences between Course 1 and 2 students, thus allowing the resulting negativity between the two camps to fester and grow. Still, the criticism leveled towards his responsibility in allowing the gap to grow only stayed at the level of whispers behind his back. Not just in magical education, Momoyama Asuma was also considered an authority in higher education, and his connections spanned across multiple fields. For Congressman Kanda, he was not someone he cared to cross swords with directly.

Wishing to successfully put on a performance while Momoyama was away, Kanda argued with Yaosaka, who was trying to prevent media coverage while the principal was away, as time gradually ticked away with Kanda holding the advantage. The dean would like nothing more than a result where time had expired. For Congressman Kanda, that result would be synonymous to “winning the battle and losing the war”. Just as Kanda started to become agitated and was about to force the issue, a sound that imitated piano music resonated from the principal’s office.

Accompanied by the sudden chime of a clock, the monitor on the wall covered with a famous Impressionist painting began running secretly. Swiftly, the image was transformed into a clear, real-time picture.

“Principal!? Aren’t you in a meeting?”

The one who appeared on the screen that could forcibly exchange broadcast signals for receiving signals was Principal Momoyama, who should have been in a meeting with the Magic Association.

“I was able to make a little time available.”

Only sparing a single sentence towards the dean’s question, Principal Momoyama turned his gaze and stared at Kanda.

The image shown by the cameras installed at strategic locations at the four corners of the monitor gave the misconception that an actual person was standing there. Under Momoyama’s piercing gaze, Kanda began to feel a little uneasy.

“So, Congressman Kanda. What is your business today?”

In the image, Momoyama kept his white hair groomed in the chonmage fashion and the bottom half of his face was covered by a pure white mustache and goatee. Unobscured by white hair, the area surrounding his eyes was sunken, rendering his expression difficult to decipher. Even so, the piercing gaze emanating from the depths of those sunken eye sockets perfectly conveyed the utter fury caused by this rude visitation with no room for misinterpretation.

“Ah, no, I humbly apologize for bothering you without making an appointment ahead of time.”

Though this was more or less the same way he treated Yaosaka, this time Kanda tightened his abdomen when he replied.

“Since you are already aware of that, could you please change your visit to another day?”

Seizing hold of Kanda’s words, Momoyama stepped his demand as if completely covering his words. Coming from the highest authority in the school, the words “visit another day” had even more weight than if he was here personally. Though Kanda’s reflexes almost prompted him to nod, he barely managed to stop in time thanks to the reporters in his employ urgently whispering “congressman, congressman”.

“Usually, I would have done as the principal had requested, but currently I have a thought of my own.”

“Ho.”

Momoyama maintained his solemn gaze as he urged him to speak further. Even through the camera, Kanda was still clearly being overwhelmed by Momoyama’s aura, but his tongue was barely able to function.

“Recently, there have been some ugly rumors floating around society in regards to the curriculum here at the magic high school. Have the students at the nine magic high schools been brainwashed into becoming soldiers?”

“What a ridiculous notion.”

His expression highly incensed, Momoyama fired back. He was just the principal of First High, so he had no authority to command all of the magic high schools, but the improvements he had made to the magic high school curriculum had all been adopted as the standard by the other 8 magic high schools. As an educator, Momoyama was fiercely proud of the Magician developmental project that he had personally devised.

“Congressman Kanda, are you aware of our school’s graduation statistics? For example, 65% of our graduates last year chose to attend the Magic University. Less than 10% of the students chose to attend College of National Defense.”

Momoyama retaliated against Kanda with clearly defined metrics. However, Kanda replied back to the retaliation with a delighted smile as if he had been waiting for that move for quite some time.

“Yet, after researching the advancement of the Magic University graduates, 45% chose a job related to the JSDF. If combined with the students who enrolled in the College of National Defense after graduating high school, more than half of the students educated in the magic high schools become affiliated with the JSDF.”

Seeing Kanda wearing an expression that fairly crowed at unleashing his trap, Momoyama never wavered.

“That’s merely the paths they have chosen for themselves. In the final year at Magic University, they are mature adults capable of making their decisions. Even small interjections from the wayside cannot cause any meaningful effect.”

“Of course.”

For some reason, Kanda nodded gravely at Momoyama’s argument.

“My thoughts are perfectly aligned with what the principal said. Precisely because of this, I have come to inspect the school in order to erase the irresponsible impression that magic high schools are nothing more than a developmental camp for the military.”

Kanda’s unspoken words were that he was going to spread propaganda about the magic high school’s impression in the manner of his choosing. For the wily Momoyama, a ploy on such a level was never going to slip by him.

“What a headache. Technical Skills classes for magic are extremely delicate. A sudden visit may cause a disturbance among the students.”

“I definitely won’t cause you any trouble.”

At this point, Kanda’s attitude hardened. Rather than him recapturing his original pace, it was more appropriate to say this feeling was as if he had grown stubborn because he couldn’t beat Momoyama.

“……If you say it like that then I will grant you permission to observe.”

After making the motions to pretend that he had considered this for a while, Momoyama adopted the stance of approving Kanda’s request. Heedless of the openly thunderstruck and bewildered Dean Yaosaka, Momoyama continued speaking in a tone that brooked no refusal.

“However, you are only allowed to observe from the fifth period onward.”

“That…… No, that’s fine.”

Kanda was about to object to the unexpected condition out of reflex, but since he had already said that he “definitely won’t cause trouble”, he was in no position to make any objections.

“Dean, which classes are scheduled for Technical Skills classes during fifth period?”

Feigning ignorance to Kanda’s internal battle, Momoyama asked this question to Yaosaka.

The mixed feelings of surprise and bewilderment in Yaosaka were exchanged for complete amazement. That was because even without Yaosaka’s reply, Momoyama usually had a perfect grasp of the class schedules for every class across all years.

“There is no class scheduled for Technical Skills during fifth period.”

Even so, his current situation did not allow him to question this and only allowed him to answer the question posed. Yaosaka replied back to the question asked of him.

“However, excluding official class schedules, the students from Year 2 Class E have requested to conduct an extracurricular experiment in the school quad.”

“It’s just as you heard, Congressman Kanda. It looks like you’re better off coming another day.”

“That cannot be! Then at the very least, allow me to observe halfway through fourth period.”

Accommodating their schedule on another day would allow Momoyama to make all the necessary preparations ahead of time. Principal Momoyama also had close connections with the opposition party that Kanda was a part of. Clearly, their forced visitation today was a surprise attack because he feared Momoyama’s influence, which was an advantage he wouldn’t have if he came another day.

Kanda had backed down because he had this in mind, but now he had already agreed.

“Congressman Kanda. In the middle of an experiment, students will lose their concentration and be distracted by microphones and cameras. In the worst case scenario, students can even suffer irreparable harm due to failure in magic. Nor would any teacher wish for something like this to occur.”

At the end of the day, Kanda was an outsider when it came to magic. He had no basis to refute Momoyama’s words. Just as Kanda used students as an excuse, he didn’t dare to cause a ruckus that might ruin a student’s future.

“……I understand. In this case, even if it’s an extracurricular experiment, please allow me to attend.”

“I see. Dean, summon Smith-sensei and have her guide Congressman Kanda.”

Highly frustrated, this was the only thing Kanda could say. Without betraying any glee, Principal Momoyama gave these orders to Dean Yaosaka and cut the connection.



After fifth period began, one of the reporters in Kanda’s employ began whispering to him while Jennifer was leading them to the radiation lab that was being prepared.

“Congressman, don’t you think something is odd?”

“What are you referring to?”

The voice Kanda responded with was low with displeasure, but the reporter paid no mind as he continued.

“The fact that there was not a single Technical Skills class. It’s almost as if they knew we were coming.”

“Nonsense…… It’s just a coincidence. They should have no idea about our movements. After all, I didn’t even report this to the party.”

“But, this coverage was a little strange from the get go. Usually, any media coverage related to magic would immediately draw interference even during the planning phase, but no one spoke up this time.”

Just as Kanda was about to reply that this was natural, he suddenly quieted. The reason why the Magic Association didn’t interfere today was because steps were taken at the highest level within the association. Though the helping hand remained anonymous, Kanda was more or less able to guess their identity. With that in mind, it was true that several points became suspicious.

Though Kanda was acting as an anti-magic supporter, he wasn’t of the belief that Magicians were inhuman creatures. In reality, he acknowledged the benefits Magicians posed. His political agenda involved championing anti-magic sentiment in front of the media. With a little fiery rhetoric that was popular with the masses, Magicians could come under serious fire. The one acting behind the scenes to ensure that today’s coverage (the political propaganda with this as the goal) remained free of interference understood this, hence Kanda was tacitly approved by this mysterious benefactor to engage in this demagogy to prevent politicians who truly hated Magicians from seizing power.

Yet, was this reason sufficient to allow them to turn a blind eye to his anti-magic demonstration? If it was truly that person, then it was highly likely that he would use him as a political tool to the fullest. However, that did not guarantee that everyone in the Ten Master Clans saw eye to eye in this.

While he was ruminating on this and the reporters who were serving as his underlings fretted, their group with Jennifer in the lead arrived at the radiation lab.



As Kanda and company stepped into the radiation lab, they abruptly came to a halt when they detected unfriendly eyes on them. The icy gazes directed towards them from the students making preparations in the lab were almost as if they knew that they were coming. Yet, that only lasted for an instant as the students seemed to completely forget about the politician and his coterie and directed all of their attention to the task at hand. No matter if it was Kanda or the reporters, they all got the feeling that the earlier cold gazes sent their way seemed to be misconceptions.

“Smith-sensei, these people are?”

The one who spoke up – the only one who showed any sign of caring - was Tsuzura, who was currently overseeing the students.

“Congressman Kanda and several reporters on tour of the school.”

“A national congressman is one thing, but why are there reporters accompanying him? Media coverage on campus requires permits approved ahead of time. I have heard absolutely nothing about this.”

Kanda’s face almost crumbled when the handsome man who, even at first glance, carried himself with a scholarly air swept a surprisingly sharp gaze over him.

“The principal has granted permission.”

Fortunately, Kanda had no need to answer Tsuzura’s question as Jennifer replied for him.

“I thought the principal was away on business.”

“He made some time and communicated this over the phone.”

“I see.”

Both Kanda and the reporters under his employ were mildly dissatisfied with how easily Tsuzura accepted such a simple answer. Still, compared with groundless enmity, this was a far easier way to go about their business. Convincing himself to accept this, Kanda struck up a conversation with Tsuzura.

“I apologize for interrupting your class.”

“Hardly, this isn’t my class actually.”

But haven’t you set your sights on us? Though they heard the sound of someone unable to hold back a snort of laughter, by the time they turned their eyes towards the students, they were all working away with serious expressions on their faces, leaving no way to tell who laughed. Kanda drew deeply within himself to suppress the mounting rage that had nowhere to go as he spoke to Tsuzura again.

“I heard this is an extracurricular experiment. What are they planning to do?”

“The students have volunteered to conduct an experiment that is not covered by the curriculum.”

In response to Tsuzura playing dumb (in Kanda’s eyes), Kanda had to take deep breaths to control his frustration.

“What kind of experiment is it?”

This question was posed by one of the reporters. The reason why Tsuzura turned a disapproving look on that reporter was because he had failed to present himself. However, no response to the reporter’s question or question directed towards the reporter’s name was formulated here.

“Sensei, we have finished our preparations. May we move the experimental device?”

As the leader of the experiment, Isori contacted Tsuzura and happened to interrupt the conversation between the reporter and Tsuzura.

“……Hm, you may.”

Using an information terminal the size of an A4, Tsuzura verified the checklist that Isori passed along and gave his approval. In response, the members of the robotics club responsible for support only replied back that they had been waiting forever before beginning to operate the controls on the wall.

Throughout all this, Kanda’s expression remained unchanged, but his underlings’ eyes bulged in shock.

The wall of the radiation lab opened without a sound.

This was just a tunnel used to transport large machines, but seeing one wall of a windowless lab soundlessly yawning open gave off vibes usually found with a secret base.

Still, this feeling only came from personnel from the outside, as the students had long since tired of this sight and began pushing a pedestal holding a spherical sink measuring 2 meters in diameter that was half filled with a combination of heavy and light water (the other half was filled with steam) before the wall opened completely. Despite using the word push, the pedestal was equipped with a motor, rendering movement a piece of cake so long as the proper direction was provided. One by one, the students left for the school quad, with Tsuzura following afterwards.

“Let’s go.”

With those words from Jennifer, Congressman Kanda and the reporters frantically hurried to catch up.



“Speaking of which, why isn’t an official experiment being conducted during class time? Is this common?”

“Infrequently.”

In response to the question coming from the reporter who hurried to catch up, Tsuzura gave a cold reply. However, he must have felt that such a reply was too inhospitable and immediately expanded his explanation.

“Based on the original plan, this experiment was supposed to be conducted after school. However, since quite a few faculty members who knew about the details wanted their own students to participate, we temporarily put a hold on all Technical Skills classes so that all the interested students can freely participate. Holding the experiment on school grounds also came from the same reason.”

“Is this an experiment proposed by the students?”

Another reporter asked in disbelief.

“Actually, this experiment will be highly meaningful from both the theoretical and practical perspectives.”

“In terms of practical, you are talking about something like the secret weapon used during the ‘Scorched Halloween’ that could one shot an entire enemy fleet?”

Tsuzura cast a chilly gaze on the reporter who wore a mocking smile as he asked this.

“This experiment is intended to challenge one of the three Great Puzzles of Gravity-Type Magic.”

After leaving this answer, Tsuzura walked towards the students gathered beneath the spherical water sink.

The reporter attempted to inquire further from Jennifer, but she beat him to the punch.

“It’s starting.”

Maybe due to their professional instincts as journalists, all of their attention was drawn towards the experimental device fastened in the school quad by the school buildings to the side.



The experimental device known as the Stellar Furnace was composed of a simple design that had a spherical water sink on top of a pedestal. The water pump had already been removed in the radiation lab. Metallic cups 15cm across were attached to the equator of the water sink, to which four rods extending from the pedestal supported these metallic cups. The water entry point directly above was stoppered by a circular pan 30cm across the diameter and a similar pan was affixed on the other side.

The experimental device attracted the attention of many a student standing in the windows of the school dorm. Practically all the classrooms had abandoned any pretense of actually studying. Predicting that this would happen, most of the faculty had halted Technical Skills classes and switched to terminal lectures.

Students who were unsatisfied with standing by the windows also came downstairs to the quad. The entire Year 2 Class E as well as the Student Council members who were not part of the experiment were all in attendance. Likewise, previous members of last year’s Year 1 Class E as well as all the female participants from last year’s Nine Schools Competition were present as well. Beyond the students, quite a few teachers were also here.

“Commence the experiment.”

The one on the mike was Tatsuya. All the students gathered in the quad fell silent without another word. Swallowing hard, the students and faculty looked on in wonder as Tatsuya gave the signal.

“Gravity control.”

Miyuki activated Gravity Control-Type Magic. A gravitational field formed in the interior of the water sink as the mixed water that was half heavy water and half light water became hollow in the center, pushing the water outward towards the inside of the water sink.

“Ionization.”

Kasumi and Izumi activated Shift Magic – Dispersal-Type Magic. Transforming liquid into the fourth phase, which was essentially ionization magic.

On the surface of the water with a hollow center formed by Miyuki’s Gravity Control-Type Magic, Miyuki deftly manipulated the mixed water within the influence of the gravitational field to create deuterium, hydrogen, and oxygen ions.

“Neutron Barrier. Gamma Ray Filter.”

Minami added the Neutron Barrier between the magic area of the Gravity Control-Type Magic and the magic area formed by the Shift Magic. As its name implies, Neutron Barrier was a type of magic that generated a field that prevented neutrons from rebounding.

On top of that, Honoka inserted the Gamma Ray Filter between the Neutron Barrier and the Fourth Phase Shift Field. Gamma Ray Filter was a type of magic that gathered the heat energy from gamma rays and expressed it as visible light.

Both Gamma Ray Filter and Neutron Barrier were classified as Dispersal-Type Magic. Dispersal-Type Magic was defined as magic that interfered with the movement and interaction of elementary and composite particles. Magic that manipulated gamma rays was categorized as Dispersal-Type Magic because the magic interfered with light particles, but on some level this was a later classification. These two magics were originally developed to neutralize the danger of nuclear fission weapons and the two of them were researched together in most situations. For ease of research, Gamma Ray Filter and Neutron Barrier were both categorized together.

“Gravity Control.”

Miyuki began activating the second Gravity Control-Type Magic. In the center of the spherical water sink, a heavy gravitational field that was 10cm in diameter appeared. To be precise, a new gravitational field was created within the spherical area that was 10cm across and acted against the original Gravity Control-Type Magic pulling outwards by pulling towards the center, hereby amplifying matter’s mutual gravitational attraction.

As for the metallic cups attached to the equator of the water sink, they were composed of 60 Specialized CADs linked together as a sighting assistance device. The cup-shape allowed the sighting assistance device to accurately translate the physical data and distributed condition in the empty space 10cm in diameter at the center of the spherical water sink into information that aided magic casting. This information was passed along the wires inside the pillars that supported the water sink into the operating device, which happened to be the large, fixed CAD that sat in front of Miyuki for this experiment.

With processing power that dwarfed mobile CADs, the fixed CAD aggregated the data from the 60 sighting assistance devices and sent the Activation sequence to the caster. Thanks to this information, Miyuki was able to devise Gravity Control-Type Magic that was able to counteract the shifting energy within the gravitational field and implement it. Of course, this was only possible with her Magic Power as a prerequisite. Still, without the repeated gravitational field technique developed through Flying-Type Magic and the precise sighting assistance device that combined all 60 data sets, even Miyuki would not be able to continuously maintain such a stable, heavy gravitational field. This sighting assistance device was the key cog for the “Stellar Furnace” experimental device.

“Coulomb Force Control.”

Thanks to Isori exerting control over Coulomb Force, the electromagnetic repulsion within the field was lowered to 1/10000. The electromagnetic force among the particles in the nucleus of the deuterium atom was 10^36. When that electromagnetic force was lowered to 1/10000, gravity became 100 times greater than normal, hereby preventing nuclear fusion. However, there was enough thermal energy gathered to spontaneously ignite a nuclear fusion reaction, meaning that the kinetic energy of the ions had decreased. For that matter, just the rise in pressure caused by ionization was sufficient to meet reaction requirements.

A dim light appeared. A wordless shout emitted from the students observing the experiment. The brightness gradually grew stronger as the light continued for a minute, then two minutes.

The water within the spherical water sink began boiling furiously. The theory behind this experimentally gathered thermal energy was the same as magnetic confinement thermonuclear reactors. By hitting neutrons with a decelerator, the kinetic energy of the neutrons could be converted into thermal energy. In terms of the design for this sort of nuclear fusion reactor, structural weakening due to constant exposure to neutron radiation was a problem that must be overcome in order to directly bathe the thermal energy gathering device within high speed neutrons. Structural weakening due to exposure to neutron radiation became the defining threshold for creating a practical and enduring thermonuclear reactor. However, in this experiment, water was used as the decelerator for neutrons and the hollow sphere formed of water completely encompassed energy from the reaction, hereby removing the problem of having the neutron radiation pass through a vessel to hit the decelerator. This design was also a highly effective countermeasure to the structural weakening of the walls. Gravity control turned the possibility of creating an empty sphere within the water a reality.

The digital thermometer set alongside the spherical water sink showed that the mixed water boiling inside had reached 300 degrees. The air pressure within the sphere could be calculated to be 100 atmospheres. Although gravity control could prevent the device from falling apart regardless of how high the internal pressure rose, the vessel’s endurance was about to reach its limit.

“Experiment concluded.”

Three minutes after the start of the experiment, a declaration announcing the end of the experiment was issued from Tatsuya’s lips. The Coulomb Force Control-Type Magic and the second Gravity Control-Type Magic were halted and the light within the experimental device faded.

“Disabling Gamma Ray Filter.”

After verifying that the nuclear fusion reaction had halted, the Gamma Ray Filter used to capture the neutron’s gamma rays was also disabled.

“Disabling Gravity Control, maintain Neutron Barrier.”

The wall of water covering the inside of the vessel succumbed to Earth’s gravity and fell to the bottom of the vessel.

Operable arms from the robotics club connected a cable to the top of the spherical vessel. The front end of the cable contained a gas analyzer. After opening the lid, gas within the vessel quickly flowed towards the analyzer on account of the difference in pressure.

“Gaseous composition includes steam, deuterium, hydrogen, and oxygen. No deuterium ions or other radioactive compounds have been detected!”

Sitting in front of the analyzer, a highly excited Kento gave a simple report of the findings. Despite calling it simple, so long as there were no calculation errors, there would be no chance of missing anything. This caused an excited ruckus to ripple through those assembled here to observe the proceedings.

“Begin adding water.”

Following Tatsuya’s orders, a malleable water hose was connected to the cable and began pumping cold water into the receptacle. Thick steam began to be emitted from the inside of the spherical water sink, but the steam swiftly faded away to reveal a water sink full of transparent water.

“Disabling Neutron Barrier.”

Tatsuya directed a grateful look at Minami, who was in the process of lowering her shoulders, before directing his gaze towards Honoka, Kasumi, Izumi, and Miyuki in that order. Finally, he and Isori caught each other’s eyes and nodded before Tatsuya passed the microphone into Asuza’s hands, as she had been diligently observing the various recording devices until now.

Shaking her head repeatedly, Azusa tried multiple times to press the microphone back to his hands. However, unable to withstand Isori’s smile and Tatsuya’s wordless pressure, Azusa wore a tear stricken expression as she accepted the microphone.





After taking many deep breaths, Azusa moved the microphone to her lips. Adopting a determined expression – though it seemed more like a self-destructive expression – she made her declaration to the assembled students who had witnessed this entire process.

“The sustainable thermonuclear experiment using continuous Gravity Control-Type Magic as its core has reached the expected goal. I hereby declare the ‘Stellar Furnace’ experiment to be a success.”

Both the quad and the dorms were filled with cheers at the same time. The fervent cheers that could be described as a tad volatile were also the cries that heralded both the possibilities and future of “magic”.



Overcome by the students’ cheers, Congressman Kanda and his reporters stood completely frozen and it was only when the spherical water sink was being brought back into the radiation lab and the students were filtering out of the quad back to their classes that they finally recovered their wits.

“What was that just now?”

In a voice quaking with fear, one of the reporters asked of Tsuzura and Jennifer, who were deep in their own conversation.

“That experiment was about the continuous Gravity Control-Type Magic Thermonuclear Reactor.”

However, a literal question received a literal answer. The reporter’s voice grew rougher due to his agitation, but Kanda, as expected of someone who had survived the double-dealing world of politicians, was not so easily ruffled.

“What is that thing? Didn’t they give up on a practical thermonuclear reactor?”

That was Kanda’s question,

“Who said gave up on?”

“Gave up on what?”

And those were replies given at the same time by Tsuzura and Jennifer. The two exchanged a glance after their voices overlapped before Jennifer once again opened her mouth.

“We never gave up. We just set its priority below finishing a solar energy system first. Although research on a large-scale experimental device was halted due to budget issues, the topic itself continues on even in fields other than magic.”

Although they heard a snide “Ho, is that so” slip out of Tsuzura’s mouth, both Kanda and Jennifer ignored him.

“Using magic to conduct thermonuclear research is also a part of this. Thermonuclear reactors using electromagnetic magic were abandoned due to its complexity, but in comparison, the new thermonuclear reactors relying on Gravity Control-Type magic continue to be researched in the world of magic theory.”

“When you say research on thermonuclear reactors, is that so you can create a viable thermonuclear detonation through magic?”

“Such as the one used during the ‘Scorched Halloween’?”

The questions posed by the two reporters were filled with malice, causing Jennifer to wrinkle her brow.

Nevertheless, barbed indictments did not fall from her lips.

“HA HA HA HA……”

Tsuzura’s insolent laughter removed Jennifer’s sting and slightly terrified the reporters.

“Thermonuclear detonation? Pray indulge my question, but what were you just observing?”

The unnatural usage of the two-fold niceties was an intentionally impolite jab. Even an imperceptive individual could tell that the words literally meant “are your eyes just for show?”. This man who bears the name Tsuzura not only had an arrogant attitude but also carried a sarcastic personality.

“Creating a miniature explosion doesn’t even require such a complex magical combination, nor would the giant explosion you guys are talking about use one either. Furthermore, the only successful example of a large scale thermonuclear explosion comes from the Brazilian Army’s Miguel Diaz and his Strategic-Class ‘Synchronized Linear Fusion’ Magic. No one else has been able to recreate Diaz’s ability. Even with the countless talented students at our school, did you really think such a thing is possible?”

Heightened displeasure had contorted the reporters’ faces. They were aware that their opponent was the expert and they were only outsiders. In addition, they were completely ignorant on how difficult “Synchronized Linear Fusion” was. If there was only one successful example in the world, then there was no way they could forcibly stretch this to include high school students even at the experimental level.

Yet, they had long since grown accustomed to this level of sarcasm. The source of this expected displeasure was the dismissive attitude that treated the reporters like common rabble. Not only Tsuzura, the reporters felt that the dean, the principal, the female teacher standing over there, and even the students never bothered to treat these messengers of public opinion with any sort of respect.

“Today’s thermonuclear experiment was aimed at the energy sources that are the foundation of society. Although there are quite a few more hurdles left to circumvent, if this Stellar Furnace becomes more practical, then it will probably provide a more abundant source of energy than solar energy.”

Tsuzura kept his eyes on Kanda as he said this. Even if they were unwilling to accept this, the reporters knew from the bottom of their hearts that they were nothing in Tsuzura’s eyes.

“What do you think, Congressman Kanda? Our students have a fine spirit of peaceful, civic contribution, do they not?”

“You are…… quite right. I think that their proactive attitude towards the betterment of society should be commended.”

Maybe he had a switch somewhere, but in the face of Tsuzura’s brazen tour de force, Kanda could only nod his head unwillingly.

In response, Tsuzura revealed a fake smile and bowed towards Kanda.

“Thank you very much, Congressman Kanda. I will record the words you just spoke. I’m sure you will not object, in the name of fostering students’ motivation?”

“No, that’s……”

“Surely there’s no problem?”

“Ah, no, there would be nothing better if I could help out these children.”

Keeping his eyes averted, Kanda politely nodded and left this simple sentence before quitting the field. Not just the school quad, but First High altogether. He remembered that above all else, it would be terrible if he came out on record with statements that ran counter to his original intent, so today he would have to temporarily retreat.

Without a god to worship, one could not remain at the festival. Abandoning the triumphal parade was the only choice as the reporters could only bring their coverage of First High to a grinding halt.



Jennifer watched the congressman’s party responsible for this disturbance leave and once they were out of sight, immediately spoke to Tsuzura.

“Tsuzura-sensei.”

Completely immersed in Japanese culture, Jennifer was in no way different than a Japanese person save for her appearances alone. When referring to her colleagues, she used “sensei” and not “Mr.”.

“Didn’t you go a little too far?”

Still, putting it so politely was also distinctly Japanese. Being brutally honest would surely be chalked up as an American bias.

“Eh, sorry about that display.”

Tsuzura seemed to be a little embarrassed at being pointed out.

“I couldn’t help but get a little angry when I saw our students’ good intentions being misconstrued.”

“Intention…… is it?”

It wasn’t that she was unfamiliar with the meaning behind those words. To be honest, Jennifer knew Tsuzura since Magic University. Though Jennifer was quite a few years older, their position at the Magic University was the same – they were research colleagues. Also, by the strictest terms, they were colleagues on an excellent footing. The reason why Jennifer was shocked by Tsuzura’s words was because this wasn’t like him. Though Tsuzura was acknowledged as a weirdo by everyone at First High, that was only because his personality was the type that abandoned anything unnecessary to the extreme degree. Usually, he was not someone who acknowledged the value of something emotional like “intention”. For the typical Tsuzura, “motivation” and “objectivity” were things to be dissected and not valued. It was precisely because Jennifer was aware of this that her question slipped inadvertently from her lips.

In that regard, Tsuzura himself was aware. The reason why he was embarrassed was because he felt that words like “intention” didn’t suit him.

“Well, that…… From a technical standpoint, this experiment is still a little immature. It was overly reliant on the individuals’ magical prowess. Success was only achieved due to the members selected, so there are still many problems that need to be solved prior to actualization.”

Jennifer nodded in agreement to Tsuzura’s points. She held the exact same opinion.

“However, I believe that his willingness to use magic to challenge the status quo of society contains a value that is completely unrelated to this technique’s completion. I believe that the intention to face society and change its perceptions is valuable beyond compare.”

Maybe because he was unable to hide his shame any longer, Tsuzura added the words “Despite how unsuitable these words are for me” before averting his gaze.





Chapter 14




Thursday, April 26th. While riding the train to school, Tatsuya wore a slight “Oh?” expression when he engaged in his customary practice of pulling out the information terminal and scanning the news.

“Onii-sama, is there something on the news that drew your attention?”

The alteration in his facial expression was minute as usual, but as usual, even this was not enough to escape Miyuki’s eyes.

Sitting in a seat across from Miyuki, Minami raised her head. Any emotional expression on her part was more cautious and not a true poker face. The gaze Minami sent Tatsuya’s way also declared her interest in the question Miyuki posed for Tatsuya.

“It’s just regarding the experiment you two helped out with yesterday.”

Tatsuya turned his face towards Miyuki sitting by his side and spoke in a volume sufficient to allow Minami sitting diagonally across from him to hear.

“I had already anticipated that both positive and negative news would appear today. However, I feel that there are more positive responses than negative.”

Miyuki’s eyes and expression clearly asked “What is strange about that?” as she urged Tatsuya onward.

“Setting aside the national congressmen who has an ear to the wind, I didn’t think that a demonstration of that level could cause reporters from major newspapers to capitulate. Here I thought they would stubbornly continue to compose more news with one-sided appraisal. To be honest, I had planned to use this line as a trap for those manipulating public opinion.”

Hearing Tatsuya’s confession, Miyuki’s eyes widened as if to say “Really”.

“Now that we’re at this point…… However, Onii-sama, you’re evil.”

Though Miyuki was not earnestly criticizing him, Tatsuya had long since come to the conclusion that he had no other choice but to chuckle wryly in situations like these. –On the other hand, Minami seemed honestly stunned.

“As I suspected, the writing in these articles is simply ridiculous……”

As he said this, Tatsuya showed Miyuki the screen of the information terminal he was holding. The headline was “Magic High school students challenging water explosion experiments” and, compared to major newspapers, this smacked even more of yellow journalism aimed at inciting the entire city.

“Even I could not predict this.”

While saying this, Tatsuya removed the displayed news article and another chain of articles appeared on the information terminal’s screen.

“—Challenge of youths, facing the 22nd century – eh? Looks to be a special bulletin from this newsgroup. Are they writing about what happened yesterday?”

Miyuki must have shared Tatsuya’s surprise as she tilted her head to ask him. This bulletin was organized by subject and contained the positive news about the revolutionary undertakings attempted by the youth. This was clearly incompatible with the subject of inciting anti-magic sentiment.

“Ah. Yesterday, a reporter from this newsgroup also came, so it should come as no surprise that this was posted. Yet, I recall that this bulletin was completely covered by the anti-magic movement until yesterday……”

“Have they had a change of heart thanks to Onii-sama’s Stellar Furnace?”

In comparison to the absolutely bewildered expression on Tatsuya’s face, Miyuki’s tone seemed to imply that this was perfectly natural.

“……That is a possibility if this reporter was interested in novel things or this resonated personally with them. Given that this is a bulletin, it does not necessarily preclude the possibility that everyone in the editorial department also shares this sentiment.”

Tatsuya understood that organizations were things that could not be closely united and the greater the organization, the greater the inclination of fracturing, and he also had personal experience in this matter. There were situations where one department went off the rails in regards to the company’s policy, so Tatsuya tentatively accepted this outcome for the moment.



In truth, things were not so simple. Among the major newspapers that were uniformly anti-magic, yesterday’s experiment did prove to be one of the catalysts that caused the appearance of perspectives in support of magic. The fact that a national congressman was surprised and acknowledged the magic high school students was also a newsworthy event for more than a few newscasters, but of course that wasn’t all that happened.

Tsuzura’s recording of Congressman Kanda’s declaration was passed along to the congressman himself thanks to an assistant from his time at the Magic University. In addition, there was also a roundabout request to slightly curb his activities. A major reason why this recording wasn’t shown on the newspapers was of course thanks to the reporters working for him.

Furthermore, Principal Momoyama lodged a serious complaint with the upper echelons of the opposition party in regards to the unannounced visitation on campus with reporters in tow, forcing Congressman Kanda and other congressmen also in the anti-magic camp to temporarily lower the scale of their activities. From a certain perspective, Principal Momoyama made full use of Tatsuya’s little ploy.

In addition, there was also supporting fire coming from the private sector.

“Hey, look, Tatsuya. This interview is still being shown.”

During lunch in the cafeteria, Leo pointed his index finger at the recommended news image being displayed on the wall monitor. Without bothering to look in the direction Leo was pointing, Tatsuya continued to silently dine.

“It’s quite rare for the Rozen side to voluntarily appear on the news in Japan, Onii-sama.”

However, just because he could ignore Leo, that didn’t mean that Tatsuya was able to deny Miyuki.

“Given that someone bearing the Rozen name has been assigned to Japan, a major policy change may be afoot.”

Paying heed to avoid looking towards Erika and Mikihiko, Tatsuya replied in a carefree manner.

Of the 16 widescreen monitors on the wall, four of them were broadcasting the interview with Einst Rozen, CEO of Rozen Magicraft’s Japanese branch. On the screen, Einst Rozen was answering the newscaster’s questions in fluent Japanese.

“—I never thought that high school students would be able to wield such high level magic. I am astounded by the level of Japanese magical techniques.”

“Isn’t he applauding you guys?”

“…………”

Completely unlike her usual flair, Erika had remained silent since the very beginning. In comparison, though this was not exactly the right way to put it, Tatsuya once again ignored Leo’s merry attempt to engage him in conversation.

“After seeing the successful experiment conducted by students at First High yesterday, I caught a glimpse of how the techniques and possibilities of magic can bring about greater prosperity to mankind.”

“Incredible. He even said the prosperity of mankind.”

Seeing Shizuku frankly express, without any ulterior motive, her amazement to this recognition, Tatsuya once again blandly replied “That was thanks to everyone’s hard work”.

“Hm, both Miyuki and Honoka were amazing.”

“I, I didn’t do anything that impressive……”

Watching the ruckus brewing between Shizuku and Honoka, Tatsuya was caught between contemplating “what is Rozen’s goal here?” and surprised that “they appear to be wise enough to make sure that the names of the high school students were not revealed”.




Though unexpected, the various positive responses garnered by the Stellar Furnace experiment significantly lifted the spirits of the students at First High. Even if they were not the ones responsible, they were still students at the same school acknowledged by society. Even if this was a superficial manner, the desire to be recognized at their tender age was satisfied upon recognition being bestowed on the group they belonged to.

During 5th period, or shortly after the end of the last period after lunch. In Year 1 Class A, Takuma was preparing to head for Club Activities Group after class when an unpleasant conversation resounded in his ear for the umpteenth time. The topics his female classmates were conversing about were the CEO of Rozen Magicraft’s Japanese branch, Einst Rozen, as well as the comments the CEO made yesterday. Other female students in class were also clamoring to join the experiment. Takuma suddenly rose to his feet, without paying any heed towards masking his agitated mood. Noticing Takuma’s sudden, sinister burst, the chatting girls halted their conversation.

The reason behind his attitude was because the class’s atmosphere was too giddy. Plainly, students from Class A had not directly participated in yesterday’s experiment. Kasumi and Minami were from Class C, Izumi was from Class B, and Class A didn’t send any supporting personnel to operate the machines. That being said, after receiving high marks from the cadre of a world-famous corporation, almost all of the students were as excited as if they were the ones responsible for this feat. That is to say, every student save Takuma himself.

Damn it, while that thought ran through Takuma’s mind, he was unable to finely control his own emotions at this time. Praise directed towards the Saegusa Family – that was what he believed – or whatever it was had exhausted all of Takuma’s patience. Finally, without any word to excuse himself, Takuma left the classroom as if fleeing.



Takuma’s rotten mood failed to dissipate even during his time at the Club Group Activities HQ. His techniques were a mess thanks to his lack of concentration, causing his stress to amplify as he failed at things that normally posed no challenge to him. After school, Takuma’s agitation had reached a peak.

For Takuma, today was an unlucky day.

After retrieving his own CAD from storage in the office, Takuma ran into Kasumi wearing her Public Moral Committee bracelet in the school quad on the way home.

After club invitation week, members of the Public Moral Committee returned to duties by shift. Generally, patrols were conducted by one person alone, and this was no exception even for new students, thus Kasumi was alone. After taking the time into account, she was probably on her way back to headquarters. This is why there was nothing odd in Kasumi passing a cursory glance over Takuma before passing by him. In all likelihood, what transpired next was the product of Takuma’s inferiority complex.

“Looks like everything is going according to plan, Saegusa.”

Takuma believed that Kasumi was mocking him.

“……What are you referring to?”

Kasumi coming to a stop and turning around with a shocked look on her face was not an act.

However, in the eyes of Takuma and with all the leftover stress from his father’s careful reminder from two nights ago, Kasumi was playing dumb.

Continuing along this misunderstanding, Takuma vented all of his frustration on Kasumi.

“I’m talking about yesterday’s public experiment. Haven’t you even won the attention of the Rozen branch CEO?”

“Public experiment? Shippou-kun, is there a misunderstanding somewhere?”

Kasumi was most definitely not a young girl of genteel personality. Even if she pretended to be an obedient child, her nature was that of someone who got into fights easily. Never taking the dark and treacherous route, she was someone who walked beneath the daylight. Here, she had no intention of hiding her displeasure at the malice lurking within Takuma’s words.

“Stop playing dumb. You knew ahead of time that a national congressman hostile to Magicians was coming, so that’s why you put on a show yesterday, right? You clearly took advantage of Shiba-senpai and successfully bolstered your own fame.”

“You said took advantage of? Don’t even think of bullshitting your way into this.”

Kasumi’s response grew coarse. Although Takuma’s point regarding their forewarning about Congressman Kanda’s arrival was true, Takuma also fully believed in his speculation.

“How careless of me. That guy’s reputation goes beyond this school and extends even into the 9 schools. As expected of the Saegusa, leaving nothing to chance. After your older sister, are you the one to seduce him? After all, you siblings are unimpeachable when it comes to appearances.”

“Stop joking around!”

Kasumi suddenly exploded. This force was sufficient to silence Takuma for a while. Still, blood rushed to Kasumi’s head for only a second.

“……Seduce, eh. The Shippou line of thinking is certainly debased. We, the Saegusa, haven’t even considered something like seduction. You aren’t too bad looking yourself, so why don’t you go serve as some Magician’s gigolo? Though, anyone who would want a gigolo in this day and age would probably have to be a lecherous entertainer.”

This time, it was Takuma’s turn to color in fury.

Kasumi’s metaphor did not contain a more profound meaning. The term lecherous entertainer referred to the recent news heatedly talked about over the porn websites about the liaison between a certain veteran actress and a young man that Kasumi heard a passing reference to. She wasn’t using the term “gigolo” specifically because it referred to a mature woman’s younger lover, but merely because she wanted to borrow the term from the headlines.

However, for Takuma, that term seemed to be mocking his relationship with Sawamura Maki.

“……Are you picking a fight with me, Saegusa?”

“I believe it was you, Shippou, who fired the first shot. Furthermore, have you already forgotten? I have already said that I will fully play along until I grind you into the dust, until you never dare to pick a fight with the Saegusa again.”

Takuma and Kasumi glared at one another. Both their respective right hands grabbed their left sleeves. Both of them used the same bracelet-shaped CADs. The two of them had far surpassed the point of no return.

“You two over there! What do you think you’re doing!?”

“You two, drop your hands now!”

Nevertheless, just as the two of them were about to manipulate their CADs, voices originating from behind them called out for them to stop.

The voice behind Takuma belonged to a male student.

The voice to the rear of Kasumi came from a female student.

Takuma pulled back the left sleeve with his right hand as he turned around.

On the other hand, Kasumi dropped her right hand and turned.

In Takuma’s field of vision, a slightly familiar-looking upperclassman reached his right hand towards his left breast with a serious expression.

He was planning on pulling out the pistol-shaped CAD stored in the shoulder holster, Takuma judged.

Takuma’s counterattack was all reflex.

His right hand touched the CAD’s power switch.

The upperclassman who was his opponent also drew his CAD.

I won, just as Takuma thought this,

Wobbling from being struck by concussive waves from the front and back of his body, Takuma was knocked unconscious as he fell to his knees.



Detecting the signs of magic being activated behind her, Kasumi couldn’t help but turn around. While she understood that unnecessary movement in her current predicament was not a wise choice, she couldn’t ignore the activation of combat magic even if the target was not herself.

The ones who planned on using magic were the opponent she was previously in a standoff with, Shippou Takuma, and the Public Moral Committee member, Morisaki-senpai – by the time Kasumi realized this, magic had already been activated.

The first one to activate was Morisaki’s magic. Although the influence of Takuma’s Data Fortification lowered the strength quite a bit, Morisaki was still able to activate magic that caused severe shaking in front and behind the body, so from the standpoint of interrupting Takuma’s attack, he was entirely successful.

“Drawless……”

Slightly shocked, Kasumi involuntarily murmured this. It was obvious that Takuma was quicker at preparing his CAD. Specialized CADs were faster than Generalized CADs, but under those circumstances, Takuma should still have been faster regardless of the speed difference between Specialized and Generalized CADs. That was because Morisaki should have had to follow the “draw, aim” process.

Yet, prior to drawing the CAD from the holster, Morisaki had already used his own senses to aim the prepared magic. This was a high level technique for pistol-shaped CADs known as “Drawless”. Since there was an assistance device built in that “activated in the direction that the CAD was pointed in”, it was very difficult to fire pistol-shaped CADs without drawing them. Nonetheless, Morisaki did this perfectly without sacrificing the Specialized CAD’s advantage in speed.

In truth, Kasumi didn’t rate Morisaki really highly in her book. Both the scale of Magic Sequences and strength of interference were only average, it was his deployment speed that was faster, and only that alone. She once harbored the doubt as to why someone like him who clearly only possessed this degree of talent was selected into the Public Moral Committee, but at this moment, Kasumi could only frankly admit that she didn’t have a good eye for people.

Even now, her belief that Morisaki only had average Magic Power remained unchanged. Unrelated to the Magic Power that one was born with, this level of technique should come naturally to an upperclassman, Kasumi thought.

(I too need to work even harder.)

Internally buoyed with motivation, Kasumi clenched her fists,

“Kasumi.”

But when a flat voice called out her name from behind her, Kasumi’s body immediately tightened as if she jumped.

“Kitayama-senpai……”

Directly before her abashed self, Shizuku stared at Kasumi with a dark expression on her face.



After being brought back to the Public Moral Committee headquarters by Morisaki and Shizuku, Kasumi and Takuma felt like they were sitting on pins and needles. Members of the Public Moral Committee present included the chief, Kanon, as well as Morisaki and Shizuku, who had brought them here (Shizuku was not on duty today, but was coincidentally dragged into this). The Club Activities Group were represented by the head, Hattori, and the executive officer, Tomitsuka, as well as the representative from the Student Council, Tatsuya, here for some unknown reason.

“Kasumi, as a member of the Public Moral Committee, what the hell were you doing? And you were even on patrol……”

Kanon deeply sighed whereas Kasumi averted her gaze in shame.

“Shippou, you are aware that unauthorized use of magic is against school rules, correct? Using magic after getting into a fight is already a serious enough infraction, then you went ahead and attacked the Public Moral Committee member trying to defuse the situation……”

Tomitsuka’s sigh passed into the ears of Takuma as he sat there tightly with his eyes gazing straight ahead.

“At any rate, I feel that there is a need to get the whole story first.”

After hearing Hattori’s words, Kanon nodded unhappily.

“Seriously…… And here I thought we would be free of any hassle after club invitation week……”

Kanon rudely scratched her head while dipping it before raising her head to gaze sharply at Kasumi and Takuma.

“I will say this first. Kasumi’s case was attempted, so expulsion is off the table, there is still the possibility of suspension. Although also an attempted case, Shippou’s case belongs to the worst offenses for CAD related infractions and can result in expulsion.”

Takuma received Kanon’s declaration without moving a muscle. In order to prevent his body from trembling, he forced his body to stand.

“I want you both to keep that in mind as you speak. Now, what was the cause for all this?”

Kanon looked towards Kasumi’s side first.

“Shippou-kun insulted the Saegusa Family.”

Kanon turned her eyes towards Takuma.

“I received unforgivable slander from Saegusa.”

Both Kasumi and Takuma refused to look at one another.

“Huh…… Hattori, how do you want to handle this incident?”

Upon hearing Kanon’s words, Hattori opened his tightly closed eyes.

“Shippou belongs to the Club Activities Group. I do not have the confidence that I can make an unbiased decision.”

“If you say that, isn’t Kasumi a member of the Public Moral Committee?”

“Then let’s have a third party that is not the Club Activities Group or the Public Moral Committee, the Student Council, make the decision.”

With both Kanon and Hattori looking at him, Tatsuya inwardly sighed loudly. This was a sigh that everything was happening exactly how he had foreseen it. The fact of the matter was that he was only here as the representative of the Student Council because Azusa fled after getting a premonition that something troublesome was on the horizon. Isori also secured his own avenue of retreat by giving off a smile that said “the representative of the Student Council should be the Student Council Vice President”. While there was one other Student Council Vice President, Tatsuya was unwilling to push this task onto his sister, so he could come here with the determination to do his duty. In short, he had mentally composed himself to handle this irksome business the moment he had stepped into the room.

“I think it would be better if they were allowed to fight it out.”

Hattori’s brows moved slightly.

“Eh, then, we’re letting the two of them go?”

Kanon asked back in shock, but Hattori said nothing. Tatsuya had an inkling to what his thoughts on the matter were, but that was not something to be verbalized.

“Since there’s no way to discuss an appropriate solution, then strength will decide this. I heard from the previous Chief of the Public Moral Committee that this was the school’s recommendation.”

Tomitsuka displayed astonishment at Tatsuya’s declaration, but Kanon and Hattori both wore looks that said all this was natural. Speaking of which, Shizuku was looking off to the side with a sleepy expression, an expression that wished that all of this would end quickly.

“While unauthorized use of magic is a major infraction, there is no need to penalize students who only attempted it. Isn’t this a common occurrence among new students?”

This time, it was Morisaki’s turn to avert his eyes with a bitter expression on his face, but fortunately no one followed up with any barbs.

“I think that since both sides have put their honor on the line, using strength to determine the outcome would leave no cause for complaint.”

“I think that the Vice President’s idea is sound, Hattori?”

After listening to Tatsuya’s opinion, Kanon immediately asked Hattori without thinking about it.

“I have no objection. Shiba, we will rely on you for the procedural forms.”

“Understood.”

Tatsuya nodded at Hattori’s words and walked towards the direct staircase in order to obtain Azusa’s confirmation letter.

“Shiba-senpai.”

Behind him, Takuma spoke up.

“Shippou, anything you’re unsatisfied with?”

Tomitsuka was the one who issued the reprimand.

“No! But if I’m going to have a match with Saegusa, I have a request.”

Takuma was in no position to dictate terms, a fact he was well aware of himself.

“Go ahead.”

Thus Kanon urged him to speak on quickly.

“I wish for my opponent to not be Saegusa Kasumi, but Saegusa Kasumi and Saegusa Izumi both at the same time.”

“Shippou, are you looking down on me?”

Setting aside whether or not she was using the correct courtesy while surrounded by upperclassmen, Kasumi’s inquiry was a legitimate one.

“Reason being?”

Still, when she heard Tatsuya’s question for Takuma, Kasumi temporarily shut her mouth and listened carefully.

“This is a match that puts pride on the line for the Shippou and Saegusa Families. Furthermore, isn’t it public knowledge that ‘the Saegusa twins can only reveal their true strength when both are gathered together’?”

“So a victory achieved without both of them being present is not a true victory?”

“Exactly.”

Tatsuya momentarily stopped speaking before turning towards Kasumi.

“That is Shippou-kun’s position. Do you have any objections if that is the case, Kasumi?”

“Nothing at all. I will make him regret this dearly.”

“Then, so shall it be.”

With that, Tatsuya walked towards the staircase leading to the Student Council Room.



After returning with the permission slip carrying the seal of the Student Council President, Tatsuya was followed by Izumi and, for some unknown reason, Miyuki and Honoka.

“Chief, please press your seal here.”

“Eh, the seal? ……Where did I put that?”

Behind the panicky Kanon, Shizuku pulled out a small box carrying important items from the book cabinet. Clearly hiding her abashment behind a mask of courtesy, Kanon received the small box and pressed the seal on the permission slip.

As if to dispel the awkward atmosphere, Hattori coughed loudly.

“Where should we select as the grounds?”

“Please conduct this in Practice Room #2.”

Honoka was the one who answered the question Hattori directed at Tatsuya. Everyone here knew that she had come here with the passkey for Practice Room #2 without any verbal confirmation.

“Is Shiba-san the referee?”

This question came from Tomitsuka. It seemed that from the very beginning, he was highly curious as to why Miyuki was here for all this.

“No, I’m just the witness.”

Miyuki smiled as she denied Tomitsuka’s hypothesis.

“Then, the judge will be Tatsuya-kun?”

Shizuku’s question was phrased towards Tatsuya himself, but Kanon interrupted before Tatsuya could reply.

“That’s fine.”

“I have no objection.”

Hattori followed on the heels of Kanon’s words. Neither of them appeared interested in Tatsuya’s opinion on the matter.

“—Let’s go. We don’t have much time until the school closes.”

The one who proposed this match was Tatsuya, so there was no way they would allow him to say “No”. Tatsuya could only resist the urge to sigh as he urged everyone to move.



The ones who relocated to Practice Room #2 included the participants of this duel that was framed as a match, Takuma, Kasumi, and Izumi. Also present was Tatsuya in the capacity as the referee, Miyuki as the witness, and Honoka as the holder of the keys (passkeys). Rounding out the 8 people were Tomitsuka from the Club Activities Group and Shizuku from the Public Moral Committee. –Morisaki should have been here as a witness considering the duty shift of the Public Moral Committee, but Shizuku volunteered to be his replacement.



Faced with these witnesses, Takuma felt somewhat confused. Based on his knowledge, Tatsuya and Miyuki were in the Saegusa camp. With both the referee and witness on the enemy’s side, forget a stacked battle, this was going to be an uphill battle the entire way.

On the other hand, both Honoka and Shizuku were talented individuals whom Takuma wished to call upon for assistance in order to regain the Shippou Family’s rightful place. Takuma’s simple line of logic told him that if he could impress the two of them with his might here, they would be easier to persuade later down the line. –Well, this was nothing to knock a 15 year old young man for, seeing as Takuma’s mental age matched his real age. Broadly speaking, it was Tatsuya’s group that didn’t seem like youngsters befitting their age.

A completely unfavorable position, as well as the rewards involved if he could beat the odds and obtain victory.

Faced with both Saegusa sisters, Takuma’s confusion only sharpened his fighting spirit.

On the other hand, Kasumi and Izumi weren’t as invested as Takuma. Kasumi was just here because of Takuma’s one-sided meddling, though that was probably a falsehood, whereas Izumi felt like she had been roped along for the ride. Neither of them bore any particular feelings for the Shippou Family. To them, it was just irritating to be viewed hostilely, and so long as he kept to himself, they cared not the slightest that he had higher grades or was selected as the student representative.

In essence, neither of them cared for worldly status or reputation. Though they liked to be praised and detested being looked down upon, they were not the type to plot for their gain. On some level, this could be described as those blessed by the heavens lack nothing, but this wasn’t because they wished for it either.

The two of them were of one accord when it came to “drawing a period on this irritating business”. For this, they needed to utterly crush him to the point that he would never dare to give provocation again. With this determination in mind, the two of them squared off against Takuma.



Practice Room #2 was even longer than the Practice Room #3 where Tatsuya faced off against Hattori one year ago. This was a classroom designed to use medium-range magic. The area extending one meter from the walls was colored in red.

Takuma stood in the blue area while Kasumi and Izumi stood in the yellow area.

Takuma was dressed in his usual school uniform and carried a pristinely bound book under his left armpit.

Kasumi and Izumi had changed into practice uniforms that maximized ease of movement, work clothes with long sleeves and pants made from heavy fabric. Typically, a sleeveless jacket with absorption properties would be worn on top of these clothes that would be worn during Outside Technical Exercises at the artificial forest behind the mountain, but right now neither of them wore this jacket. The skintight work clothes they wore perfectly displayed their delicate curves, but Tomitsuka appeared to be the only one present who had no idea where to look.

“The rules for this match forbid physical contact.”

Tatsuya made this declaration as he stood at the dividing line between blue and yellow areas. Forbidding physical contact referred to the rule that bodily contact was forbidden during this match, a common occurrence for matches between those of different genders unless special circumstances were involved (typically, matches between women also adopted this rule).

“I believe both sides already know this, but I will go over the rules again right now. Both sides are not allowed to step outside their colored areas. Either stepping into your opponent’s area or the red area would constitute defeat. You are forbidden from physically touching your opponent’s body. This rule also extends to contact by weapons. However……”

As he said this, Tatsuya sneaked a peek at Takuma’s face.

“Using long-range magic to manipulate weapons does not constitute an infraction.”

However, Tatsuya swiftly turned his gaze to a more neutral position between the two sides.

“Finally, fatal strikes or attacks that cause irrecoverable damage to your opponent are strictly forbidden. If I judge the situation to be at risk, I will forcibly end the match.”

For an instant, Takuma wore a derisive expression, which must be because he thought “bring it on if you can”. Though Tatsuya, Miyuki, Honoka, and Shizuku all noticed this, no one scolded Takuma for his disrespectful attitude.

“Then, both sides, prepare yourselves.”

Kasumi and Izumi shifted to the center of their area.

Takuma never moved from his position near the dividing line and let the book he held beneath his armpit flutter to the ground by his feet.

Tatsuya alternately switched his eyes between the three of their faces. As one, all three of them nodded.

Retreating to the wall, Tatsuya raised his right fist over his head before swinging it down forcefully.

With a flash of psions, they released their magic.



The ones launching magic attacks were Takuma and Kasumi, while Izumi was focused completely on defense with Zone Interference.

Alone as he was, Takuma was forced to attack and defend whereas Kasumi could focus entirely on offense.

The conditions clearly favored Kasumi.

“What do you think?”

Shizuku whispered to Honoka.

“They appear to be even now, I think……”

Honoka’s whispered response was not filled with confidence.

Kasumi primarily relied on Move-Type Magic, setting Takuma himself as the target for the blocks of air sent flying towards him. This strategy aimed at forcing her opponent out of bounds to win. For defense, Takuma relied on Data Fortification and physical obstacles.

On the other side, Takuma used Oscillation-Type Magic to directly counterattack, but once deterred by Izumi’s Zone Interference, he switched strategies to firing compressed air bullets gathered in his hands. This was a popular magic known as “Air Bullet” and, given its popularity, its effectiveness was guaranteed. However, Izumi’s Zone Interference was broader than he imagined and the Air Bullet immediately dissipated once entering her Zone Interference, making it very difficult to land an effective attack.

“I get the feeling that Kasumi-chan doesn’t want to hurt Shippou-kun. That’s why the scope of her attacks has been restricted.”

“Indeed.”

“Shippou-kun, on the other hand…… Doesn’t look like he’s completely grasped how to use Air Bullet.”

“Wouldn’t it be the same for Izumi?”

“Yeah. Without putting the entire room under her dominion like Miyuki does, using Zone Interference alone is insufficient to completely block Air Bullet. The two of them are so inherently talented that they have neglected to put in the necessary hard work to perfect their skills.”

“They are new students after all.”

“That’s true. We were more or less just like them before the Nine Schools Competition.”



Although he was unable to hear Honoka and Shizuku’s conversation, Takuma was deeply conscious of the fact that “this can’t continue like this”. He frantically tried to settle his agitated heart and desperately searched for an opening while deploying his magic.

He didn’t feel that his Magic Power was inferior to theirs. He wouldn’t lose even 2-on-1 and he had the confidence that victory was his the moment he played his trump card. However, Takuma was aware that there was a high risk of injury to his opponents if he unleashed his trump card. Even though he was an upperclassman at First High, he didn’t believe that Tatsuya, who wasn’t a member of the 28 families, could stop his magic in time, but there was still the chance of him losing because he broke the rules. This was the source of Takuma’s hesitation.

However.

(Not good!)

He was trying to think while operating magic in a combat situation. As expected, this was not going to work.

He used “Dissipate” on the block of air aimed at his back. After exchanging blows thus far, Takuma had more or less grasped the differences between him and his opponents. Kasumi had the edge when it came to scale of magic, chaining spells, and versatility. Takuma was stronger than Kasumi when it came to interference strength, but he was at an impasse with Izumi in that regard.

Since his interference strength was stronger and the Magic Sequence itself was fairly simple, Takuma was able to activate “Dissipate” in a short period of time and nullify Kasumi’s “Wind Hammer” at the last second. Regardless, air released from its compressed state buffeted Takuma’s back like a strong wind. Wind Hammer’s air compression was far lower than Air Bullet. While the released air was not sufficient to deal any damage to Takuma’s flesh, it was still enough to cause his posture to buckle. Takuma’s body tilted forward, causing the accuracy of his magic to drop.

The numerous variables behind Air Bullet included size of the bullet, degree of air compression, speed of the bullet as a fixed rate once incorporated into the Activation Sequence, direction of the shot, and farthest possible range, all subject to change depending on the amount dictated by the Magician. Although direction didn’t require verification with the naked eye, line of sight was publicly acknowledged to be the easier approach to aiming.

This was why Takuma’s Air Bullets began firing towards a lower angle. A lengthy distance away from Izumi’s feet, one of the bullets along its trajectory was caught by the Zone Interference and released from its compressed state before impacting on the ground and rolling to Izumi’s feet.

With a small shriek, Izumi’s body was shaken by the wind. The unexpected wind surge caused her to lose her balance. Seeing this, Takuma immediately realized his error. It was only now that he realized that the Zone Interference nullified the compression of the air and continuously applied acceleration, but did absolutely nothing to remove the kinetic energy of the air.

The sphere of empty air that had been neutralized in mid-air expanded outwards in all directions. In short, the ones near the ground that were expanding met resistance from the ground which limited the expansion directions. The kinetic energy of the forward motion was incorporated into the air currents expanding downwards to turn into a surge of wind blowing towards his opponents.

(In other words, I just have to keep shooting in directions that will only nullify the magic and not the attack itself!)

Takuma formed 7 Air Bullets in the space in front of him. They were formed at the points of a hexagon with one of them in the center. The one in the center fired first, followed swiftly by the other 6 bullets with nary a lapse in time.

The Shippou’s magic – magic devised by the 7th Research Lab was called Herd Control. Here, the term herd does not refer to a group of biological organisms, but instead referred to a group that was connected together without any rules. Multiple independent objects, or even phenomena, were manipulated together as if they were one body.

More than just causing several hundred ice pellets to land, this Herd Control could also be used on techniques aimed at one target. For the eldest son of the Shippou Family, causing 7 Air Bullets to fire together was a piece of cake.

The first bullet fell on Izumi’s Zone Interference and detonated. However, the expanding air was immediately surrounded by the following 6 bullets and pressed forward again. In the end, the Air Bullets gradually lowered the density of the air until wind shrapnel rushed towards Izumi.

“Ah!?”

Izumi did not call out because she was struck by the wind shrapnel, but cried out after being suddenly pushed to one side. The speed that Kasumi lunged at Izumi was obviously the result of magic. She must have altered the Move-Type Magic originally targeting Takuma to herself, ignoring the increased burden that the body brought on by the acceleration process of Move-Type Magic. This was the same even if it was her own magic, just as the side being pushed aside will also suffer the same harm. My chance has come, Takuma thought.

Takuma clapped his hands in front of his chest. Within his area, the nature of sound altered. The sound of Takuma’s clapping was amplified in volume and the sound waves were gathered together before being released at Kasumi.

Even if the Zone Interference nullified the magic, the amplified volume would remain unchanged. Even if the gathered sound waves would spread somewhat, there should still be enough sound to rival a concussion grenade detonating at close range striking towards Kasumi. That should be more than enough to render her unconscious, or at least that was the plan.

Yet, Takuma’s sound wave attack was severed by the vacuum fault Izumi erected.



Air had been sucked away by the vacuum fault. The rush of wind accompanying the cacophony made a mess of Kasumi and Izumi’s hair. Kasumi’s short locks were one thing, but Izumi’s longer tresses were left in a chaotic state, yet all she did was lightly comb a hand through her hair and all was well.

“Kasumi-chan, are you OK?”

Raising her torso slightly, Izumi asked Kasumi, who was still pressing down on top of her.

“Thanks, Izumi. That was a close one just now.”

Kasumi replied back as she shifted her body away from Izumi.

Right now, Takuma continued to launch his attacks. Exchanging defensive duties, Kasumi and Izumi were barely able to hold him off.

Nonetheless, neither of them betrayed any hint of unease on their faces.

“We appear to have underestimated this guy.”

“I don’t know about the term underestimate, but that appears to be the case.”

“This will be bad if it continues on like this.”

“However, you don’t plan on losing, do you?”

“Of course. Izumi, we’re going to use that.”

“Yeah, Kasumi-chan. Just like usual.”

“I will shoot.”

“I will raise.”

“Counting down.”

“Three.” “Two.” “One.”

“Roles assigned!”

Immediately after Kasumi shouted out, the force of the magic roaring towards Takuma spiked exponentially.



Takuma immediately raised his phenomena interference strength around his back, head, and flanks. Detecting the harbinger of a hitherto incomparably powerful magic, Takuma channeled all of his offense into defense.

He felt that the magic targeted air molecules while gathering and moving them – so this must be a magic that controlled the air currents, but he had no time to continue observing. Instinct told him to erect an all directional, sealed barrier and Takuma was able to finish his defensive barrier first only because the design of the Magic Sequence for this magic was far less complex than the magic Kasumi and Izumi were about to invoke.

In the narrow framework of the classroom, a furious tornado began brewing. By the time the wind pressed down on top of his head and his entire body, the wind was everywhere around his back and sides. He was almost blown away along with the sealed barrier around him. With a barrier around him, the surface area impacted by the wind grew just as the pressure sustained would increase as well. Even with that being said, he couldn’t decrease the permeability or lower the size of the barrier. As a Magician, Takuma noticed that the level of nitrogen within the wind buffeting him had increased.

This was a magic that raised the level of nitrogen in the air as well as magic that moved blocks of air around. A combination of Gather-Type and Move-Type Magic, “Nitrogen Storm”. A single breath of this air that was heavily deficient in oxygen would immediately render someone unconscious due to lack of oxygen. If he lowered the barrier to prevent being blown away by the turbulence, then he would immediately start running short of oxygen.

Beneath Takuma’s feet where he furiously stamped to right himself, the sound of the pristinely bound book’s pages being blown furiously by the wind could be heard as the pages continuously flapped in the wind. The book itself had not been blown away because the wind from the magic only blew at a height above the knees. The pristinely bound book that Takuma carried was a particularly heavy tome. Takuma looked at the back of the book that was printed with the same geometric symbols from the first page to the last and decided to use his trump card.



“This is…… Nitrogen Storm?”

“Correct.”

In the face of Miyuki’s both shocked and amazed question, Tatsuya gave a concise confirmation.

“To be able to fluently wield such a high level magic, I guess I should say as expected of Saegusa-senpai’s younger sisters.”

“Still a little rough around the edges, but impressive nonetheless.”

On the level of neutralizing an opponent by using magic to induce a lack of oxygen, this magic probably belonged to the same category as Mayumi’s anti-personnel trump card “Dry Meteor”. Kasumi and Izumi probably devised this trump card due to Mayumi’s influence. Still, in terms of magic difficulty, Nitrogen Storm was far more difficult than Dry Meteor. Though it was a hassle to gather a large amount of dry ice particles laced with carbon dioxide in the air beforehand, Nitrogen Storm required constant maintenance of the molecular composition in the air as well as careful control of the air currents, rendering this an extremely difficult magic.

Kasumi and Izumi’s control of the air currents for Nitrogen Storm was far too coarse, which was why Tatsuya said “still a little rough around the edges”, but this was definitely a high level magic that could not be seen at the high school level.

“So this is multiplicative magic…… No wonder people say that ‘the Saegusa twins can only reveal their true strength when both are gathered together’.”

Strictly speaking, until this point Kasumi and Izumi had been using fundamental magic and only resorted to high level magic when pressed into a tight spot. As the one responsible for attacking, Kasumi didn’t use this spell not because she was unwilling or she was going easy on her opponent, but because Nitrogen Storm was too difficult for Kasumi to use by herself.

Saegusa Kasumi and Saegusa Izumi bore the name “Saegusa twins” because of the special connotation behind that name as well as the unique characteristic that only the two of them had. It is only through their complete cooperation that they are able to use high powered, and highly difficult, magic that either one of them would not be able to on their own.

People who were not Magicians would think nothing of this, but this was an atypical phenomenon for Magicians. There existed large scale, high level magical techniques that relied on multiple Magicians casting the same spell. This was especially the case in Ancient Magic, though actual examples were quite few, but certainly not rare when it came to techniques passed down from generation to generation. However, this sort of magic ritual required chanting, worship, dance or similar mediums that used all 5 senses.

When multiple Magicians use the same magic at the same time, Magic Power was not additive. In this situation, only the spell of the Magician with the greatest Magic Power would activate, while the Magic Power from other Magicians would actually interfere with phenomena alteration. Magical rituals conducted by multiple individuals required consensus among Magicians to not overlap their Magic Sequences in order to cast more complex or even gigantic Magic Sequences. Its major selling point or defining characteristic was allotting specific goals to each individual Magician, or even a task to be repeated over and over.

Yet Kasumi and Izumi were able to increase their Magic Power simply by using normal magic through usual assistance from their CADs. In addition, the two of them were not components of a Magic Sequence, but combined to form a single, greater Magic Power.

Kasumi loved to hurtle Magic Sequences at the target and Izumi gave it interference strength. Their Magic Power was multiplied rather than added together when casting magic. To be able to accomplish this, not only did their bodies have to contain the same hereditary genes, their mentality and unique magic calculation area had to be the same. Takuma might have determined that Kasumi was stronger in invocation speed and scale of design for Magic Sequences while Izumi was stronger in interference strength, that was actually a misunderstanding. The reason he was led to believe so was because that’s how Kasumi and Izumi wielded their magic, so the result would be the same even if they swapped roles.

This was purely a coincidence that could not even be replicated through genetic medication. This was the secret behind the power of the “Saegusa twins”.



Holding his breath and standing firm, Takuma fell to one knee and closed the book that was about to be blown to tatters by the wind. Immediately, Takuma once more opened the cover of the pristinely bound book. In that instant, every page within the book took to the skies like snowflakes fluttering in the wind.

The book Takuma brought contained 720 pages of foldable B5 paper. The book was 182mm wide and 256mm long (standard B5 paper was 182mm by 257mm). Excluding the 2mm on each page covered by the book covers (where the book was bound), the rest of the page was cut into little squares that were 4mm by 4mm. At that size, every two pages (one sheet) contained 2880 pieces. At 720 pages or 360 sheets, there was a total of 1,036,800 pieces of paper.

More than a million small paper squares flew along the turbulence like snowflakes towards the twins. Needless to say, those 4mm by 4mm squares weren’t just simple pieces of paper. Anyone who could capture those countless pieces of paper in their eyes could tell that those pieces of paper were not bending in the wind, like numerous thin, square-shaped blades with the hardiness of glass. At first glance, the million odd blades were dancing along without any organization whatsoever, but they were truly gathering around Kasumi and Izumi.

Kasumi and Izumi, as well as Tatsuya and Miyuki, knew very well that all of these paper snowflakes were being manipulated by a man. They who knew the Shippou Family’s magic naturally knew what this magic was.

One of the trump cards of the Shippou Family, “Million Edge”. A magic that used Herd Control to manipulate over a million pieces of paper that turned into sharp blades to eviscerate the foe.

The twins continued to control Nitrogen Storm as they employed another magic. By slamming blocks of air with large amounts of oxygen into the paper snowflakes, they were using adiabatic compression to create heated wind that surpassed paper’s burning point to ignite the paper blades.

This was an alternate form of “Heat Storm”. This was a type of magic that was another level higher than simply creating adiabatic compressed air blocks. They had activated this magic while Nitrogen Storm was ongoing, but this was still within the boundaries of their abilities right now. The main subject of the 3rd Research Lab was the control of multiple magics at the same time. The 3rd Research Lab originally intended to test the boundary of how many magics could be activated at the same time as well as raising that boundary as part of their Magician Augmentation Project. Among the Magician Development Labs, the 3rd Research Lab was a rarity in that they were open with their findings, allowing the 10th Research Lab to also benefit from this finding. For the Juumonji Family that had mastered Phalanx, this helped them incorporate more magic and resulted in the ability to use multiple magics. As for the Saegusa Family Magicians who moved to the 7th Research Lab, even if it was high level magic, using two or three of them at the same time was no difficult task.

The tornado that disallowed any breathing devoured Takuma as the air that was heated above 500 degrees Celsius was about to burn the paper squares into a crisp.

Bathed in the heat that surpassed their burning point, the million odd blades under Takuma’s will were protected by magic as they thirsted for Kasumi and Izumi’s blood.

At this rate, Takuma would keel over due to oxygen deprivation and Kasumi and Izumi would be slashed to pieces by the countless blades that had not been burned up. It was readily apparent that the conclusion would leave both sides with permanent injuries.

“That’s far enough!”

Tatsuya moved his right arm.

In his outstretched hand, a silver CAD flashed brilliantly. That was the pistol-shaped Specialized CAD, Silver Horn.

Nitrogen Storm.

Million Edge.

Heat Storm.

Their Magic Sequences were torn to shreds and a surge of psions scattered those broken remnants.

As for Tatsuya’s voice declaring a halt to the match, who knew if that traveled to the consciousness of those three in battle?

In the midst of the silence brought on by the disappearance of magic, regardless of whether it was Takuma, Kasumi, Izumi, no one could understand what had happened as they stood there in a daze. As for whether everyone present was clueless as to what happened – that was not the case. In a word, the only ones who stood there dumbly were the three participants of this match, the three Year 1 students.

While Tomitsuka’s eyes had widened, he wasn’t wearing an expression of someone who had suffered a severe shock. Though there was some element of astonishment, it would be more appropriate to say that was an expression of awe after realizing what had occurred. As for the other three, Miyuki, Honoka, and Shizuku all wore expressions that said “just as we expected from Tatsuya”.

In reality, only Miyuki alone truly understood what had just happened here. Still, the three Year 1 students could not even comprehend the fact that “Tatsuya’s Counter Magic had just nullified the magics coming from Takuma, Kasumi, and Izumi in an instant”.

“This match has resulted in both sides forfeiting the right to continue.”

As the referee, Tatsuya pronounced his judgment. At this time, the Year 1 students finally recovered from their frozen status.

“What the heck is going on!?”

The first one to question Tatsuya was Kasumi.

“I should have said this at the beginning of the match. Fatal strikes or attacks that cause irrecoverable damage to your opponent are strictly forbidden. If I judge the situation to be at risk, I will forcibly end the match.”

“Then, the result of the match is?”

Izumi was far more composed than her twin sibling, but her tone was harsher than usual as she asked her question.

“Both sides have lost the right to continue, ergo both sides have lost.”

This was not a draw, but a mutual defeat. Tatsuya intentionally said it this way to imply “there will not be another match”, but whether Izumi and company were able to understand the nuances remained unknown.

“But, Shiba-senpai, I believe that Nitrogen Storm is different than Million Edge in that this is neither a fatal magic nor would it leave a lingering repercussion.”

Izumi meant that “Wasn’t Shippou-kun the one who lost because he broke the rules?”, a detail that Takuma immediately picked up on. Takuma was about to reply immediately, but Tatsuya beat him to the punch.

“Indeed, if the power is carefully controlled, then Nitrogen Storm will not leave any serious repercussions on your opponent. However, Izumi, you two did not have that fine level of control.”

With Tatsuya visually interrogating with a “Is that not so?” look, neither of the twins spoke up.

“That is not the case!”

In place of the twins, which was not entirely the case, it was Takuma’s turn to contest Tatsuya’s decision.

“We would have determined the outcome prior to that happening!”

A spark – not out of delight, but out of interest – flashed in Tatsuya’s eyes.

“Then you are saying that you believe you won?”

“Indeed.”

Fearless in the face of Tatsuya’s cold gaze, Takuma arrogantly continued onward.

“The Saegusas’ Heat Storm failed to stop Million Edge. Before the Nitrogen Storm could have breached my sealed barrier, I would have been able to attack the Saegusas!”

A trace of satire slipped into Tatsuya’s chilly gaze.

“Which is to say that had I not interfered, hundreds upon thousands of paper strips filled with burning heat would have shredded the delicate flesh of a pair of Year 1 female students. Is that the gist of what you are trying to say?”

Around them, there were at least two people who were trying to fight down their laughter.

Takuma flushed. The redness of his face was so apparent that anyone could see it.

“In that case, Shippou, this match ends in your defeat due to rules infraction.”

Before the excited Takuma could explode, Tatsuya made this declaration in a voice so cold that it was almost cruel. This was Takuma’s defeat. Before a steely voice that was cold as ice, even Takuma himself hesitated as to how he should argue this.

“I will not allow you to say that you are ignorant of what happens to those who take a hit from Million Edge dead on.”

Takuma was about to open his mouth and say something, but Tatsuya never intended to give him a chance to defend himself.

“Allowing an attack that is completely overkill is synonymous to allowing a mutual slaughter. Under the rules of this match, that is not allowed.”

“Then!”

Takuma appeared to be trying to free himself from the tremendous pressure being exerted on him by Tatsuya and fired back with more fervor than was necessary. Just squeezing out such a simple word plainly cost him a lot of energy.

“So you are saying that from the very beginning, once I used Million Edge I would lose!?”

“If you are unable to control its power, then that is the same as breaking the rules.”

“How can that be, that’s ridiculous!”

Tatsuya remained calm and collected while facing the enraged Takuma, an attitude that only served to fan the flames of Takuma’s fury. Seeing his agitated state, not only was his senior at the Club Activities Group, Tomitsuka, worried about him, even Takuma’s opponent up until this point, Kasumi, also shared that concern.

“That’s practically denying me my trump card even before the match has started! Isn’t that an extremely unfair match!?”

“Everyone’s conditions were the same. For the Saegusa siblings, high powered magic was also forbidden.”

Still, they were the only two who cared to debate the results. The Year 2 female students – Miyuki, Shizuku, and Honoka all watched Takuma with compassionate eyes.

“Bullshit! They don’t have magic that is powerful enough to be banned!”

“Nitrogen Storm carries more than enough firepower. I didn’t stop them in the beginning because they had controlled its power to within acceptable parameters.”

Takuma was struck speechless after Tatsuya spoke in a voice that couldn’t even be called unpleasant by the widest of margins. Not only did he feel this from the cold gaze leveled at him from Tatsuya, Takuma felt that even the female upperclassmen were laughing at him. He frantically wracked his brain for a counterargument.

“However, Shippou, you were unable to finely control the strength of Million Edge.”

“That’s bullshit, I had perfect control of the spell!”

Takuma’s response was completely groundless and was only his reflex willfully using his emotions to make his decision. All of the Year 2 students present knew very well that Takuma could not completely control Million Edge.

If Tatsuya were to not only declare his own decision but also ask Miyuki, Shizuku, Honoka, and Tomitsuka to all voice their opinions, Takuma would have no choice but to concede. Setting aside Tatsuya’s people for the moment, if even Tomitsuka supported Tatsuya’s decision, then undoubtedly Takuma would have a hard time stubbornly sticking to his guns.

“I am the referee of this match, and I will determine victory or defeat. I should have said this in the beginning.”

Yet, Tatsuya failed to do so. Victory or defeat was determined by the referee. Tatsuya felt that there was no need to change that rule.

“—Ah, I get it! So you’re saying that the use of Million Edge constitutes overkill! Then you should have said so in the very beginning! If I knew that Million Edge was against the rules, I would have chosen another strategy!”

Takuma was ignorant of the fact that he was throwing a tantrum like a little child.

The gaze Tomitsuka leveled at Takuma changed from concerned to uneasy.

The look Miyuki directed towards Takuma switched from compassionate to piercing.

Nevertheless, Tatsuya continued to use cold logic to deal with Takuma’s ruckus.

“Stop sulking, Shippou. You were unable to control its power because you’re still immature. Regardless of whether it was forbidden, the inability to fulfill the requirements proves that you are still lacking.”

“You’re a Weed. You have no right to say that!”

The classroom suddenly…… fell silent. That silence was suffused with an almost painful anxiety.

Takuma’s originally flushed face now went deathly pale. He had never planned to go so far. It was almost as if all of his blood had rushed to his head, thus leading him to say something he could never take back.

Shizuku and Honoka had turned pale for another reason altogether. That was because they were fearful of the winter storm that was about to ravage this entire room. Fortunately, prior to that occurrence, Tatsuya opened his mouth.

“Are you displeased with what I said?”

Takuma also noticed that his statement was inappropriate on two fronts. “Weed” was a term that was taboo on campus. Furthermore, Tatsuya was an “exception” who had been promoted to Magic Engineering from Course 2 due to outstanding talent. Takuma thought furiously in order to recover from that blunder, but he had already been pressed into a corner and unable to restore his cool, so no solution came to his mind. Even so, Takuma still didn’t shut his mouth.

“Hmph…… I’m displeased only because of the unfair adjudication! The Saegusas were able to control Nitrogen Storm and I was unable to control Million Edge. Isn’t that too much of a bias impression on Shiba-senpai’s part? I controlled Million Edge perfectly! Shiba-senpai is clearly favoring the Saegusa!”

“Shippou…… Your words are at odds with one another.”

Takuma allowed his emotions free reign as he allowed his mouth to run wild like a child throwing a tantrum. The stunned voice that reprimanded the present Takuma came not from Tatsuya, but from Tomitsuka.

“If that situation had continued, your magic would have dealt damage to the Saegusa siblings that surpassed the bounds of this match. Didn’t you already admit that?”

“That’s because the Saegusas used Heat Storm!”

Takuma’s words were not entirely illogical. Unfortunately, in this circumstance, these words only sounded like he was shedding responsibility.

“Enough, Shippou.”

An emotionless voice inserted itself into Shippou and Tomitsuka’s conversation.

Those words were issued from Kasumi’s lips.

“To be unwilling to admit defeat to this degree, let’s just call it your win.”

“Kasumi-chan, is that really OK?”

Among those present that felt varying degrees of surprise, the one who asked Kasumi this was the one who knew her the best, Izumi.

“Yeah~, now that I think about it, we shouldn’t get so heated about something like this. No matter how you look at it, using multiplicative magic in an unofficial school match along with a combination of Nitrogen Storm and Heat Storm is just plain overkill. Shiba-senpai is right about that.”

Just like her words, Kasumi appeared to have completely calmed down.

Not only did the look they sent Takuma not contain a trace of enmity, it was absolutely carefree.

“……If that’s what Kasumi-chan wants.”

Izumi easily accepted Kasumi’s words. Originally, she was only here to help out her older twin sister. Since Kasumi said that was fine, then Izumi wasn’t going to be a stickler for the result.

Takuma looked like he was unable to decide whether to speak or not. Although he wanted to angrily shout “Don’t be ridiculous!”, he also felt that was too shameful. In the end, no shout came from him. As he fell silent thanks to this unexpected shock, he was able to reclaim a level of rationality.

Kasumi walked towards Tatsuya with Izumi following behind her.

“Shiba-senpai, I’m sorry for troubling you.”

Kasumi and Izumi both bowed to Tatsuya. The fact that 70% of Izumi’s attention was placed on Miyuki could probably be chalked up as her adorable part.

—While Takuma gritted his teeth and watched this scene.

“Still, can I say something?”

Of course, just apologizing at the end of it all was not Kasumi’s style. Nay, it was more like not facing off against Tatsuya here was not Kasumi’s style.

“What is it?”

Unlike the expression he wore while conversing with Takuma, Tatsuya wore a wry smile here.

“I – we never lost control of our magic. Forcibly stopping the match there was the wrong call on senpai’s part.”

After spilling all of those words with a resolute look in her eye, Kasumi left the practice room without waiting for Tatsuya’s reply.

“Um, well.”

Switching back and forth between Kasumi’s back and Tatsuya’s face, Izumi was truly (and quite rarely) bewildered.

“Izumi.”

“Eh!”

Though this was plainly not completely unexpected, Izumi still jumped and went ramrod straight when Tatsuya called her name. Immediately afterward, Izumi lowered her head in shame at being tongue-tied.

Tatsuya never teased Izumi or put on a solemn expression. Instead, he continued speaking with a gentle expression.

“Please send a message to Kasumi for me. If she is unsatisfied, I am always willing to be the opponent for the two of you. That’s all.”

Was this because she was astounded? Izumi’s eyes widened. Still, Izumi immediately understood that Tatsuya was saying this because he was taking Kasumi’s feelings into account. This departed greatly from her previous impression of Tatsuya.

“……I understand, senpai. Thank you.”

Izumi replied to Tatsuya as she bowed deeply to Tatsuya without going too far or too shallow. When Izumi raised her head, she remained where she was for some reason.

“What is it?”

Tatsuya asked this question to Izumi. For the first time, Izumi gave Tatsuya a smile that came from the bottom of her heart.

“I think I’ve changed my mind a little about senpai. You do have areas that make you seem like Miyuki Onee-sama’s older brother.”

This went far beyond retort worthy and the might of this line rivaled that of a train wreck. In spite of this, probably because this was far too honest to wield a forked tongue against, Tatsuya said nothing as he watched Izumi leave with an “Excuse me” and another short bow.



After Kasumi and Izumi left the practice room, Takuma continued to stand there without a word. In the eyes of the Year 2 students, he had been abandoned, but Takuma himself didn’t think that way.

“Shiba-senpai.”

At least from his perspective, he had hoped to speak to Tatsuya without anyone else present, which was why he stayed behind.

“Is there anything else you want to say?”

Tatsuya voice remained chilly, but no one called him “immature”. Anyone who heard of the conversation that had occurred in this room would definitely lay the blame at Takuma’s feet. In truth, Takuma also thought this way after recovering his rationality. Yet, at the same time, he decided against apologizing because he felt that it was far too late to do that. Excluding his behavioral blunder, he was determined to reclaim his lost face.

“I still haven’t accepted this!”

“Still haven’t accepted what?”

“That I lost because I broke the rules.”

“Shippou!”

Unable to hold it in any longer, Tomitsuka thundered at Takuma. However, Takuma kept his eyes locked on Tatsuya and never spared Tomitsuka a glance.

“What is your wish?”

Tatsuya was in position to seriously deny Takuma’s objection. In the first place, this match was designed to protect Kasumi and Takuma from the serious breach in school rules they had incurred. Protection was especially the case for Takuma, seeing as he committed the greater infraction that ran the risk of expulsion. Even if this was favoritism or a mummer’s farce, Takuma was in no position to make demands.

Even so, Tatsuya still inquired as to the source of Takuma’s dissatisfaction. Rather than calling Tatsuya a gentle soul, it would be more appropriate to say that he was the type who didn’t want to procrastinate when dealing with troublesome issues.

“Please allow me to prove it!”

“Prove what?”

“Prove that I can control Million Edge perfectly.”

“And how would you do that?”

“Please duel me. I will use Million Edge and force senpai to surrender without harming you!”

Takuma’s words caused Miyuki to lift a delicate eyebrow.

Nevertheless, white darkness failed to suffocate the classroom.

Before her emotions could explode, there came the sounds of a furious impact and a human body hitting the floor. This unexpected turnout put a hold on Miyuki’s anger.

The one who fell to the floor was Takuma.

The one who struck him down was Tomitsuka.

“……Tomitsuka-senpai?”

Towards a completely bewildered Takuma who was propping himself up with his hands,

“Shippou, don’t press your luck!”

Tomitsuka roared in absolute fury. Maybe Tomisuka’s face was originally unpleasant to look at, though not to the degree that he should be described as having the face of an enraged ghoul, this time he was truly livid.

“From the very start you’ve been spouting these arrogant and disingenuous words…… Who the hell do you think you are? Huh? Or are you saying that the 28 families are allowed to behave like that?”

“I…… I didn’t mean that.”

Takuma remained sitting on the ground as he seemed to mutter to himself. He maintained his posture of only sitting up with his upper body undoubtedly because this incredible shock had robbed him of any thought towards standing up.

Takuma truly never noticed. He never really noticed at all. Fixated on a place within the Ten Master Clans, he always looked upwards and never downwards. No, even if he did lower his head he never truly looked.

Just as Takuma never acknowledged the value of the Shippou Family absent its place among the Ten Master Clans, so too did he unwittingly look down upon the Magicians who didn’t even have the right to join the Ten Master Clans just as he derisively viewed his own father.

“Shippou. If you say you want to prove yourself, then I will be your opponent! Or are you saying that I’m not good enough for you? That ‘Range Zero’, the Tomitsuka trash of the Hundred Families, doesn’t have what it takes to be your opponent!?”

Maybe because he was completely overcome by Tomitsuka’s imposing manner, but Takuma kept crawling backwards on the ground. Was Tomitsuka about to press the attack home, or was Takuma about to demonstrate “how to flee with your tail between your legs”? Regardless of which one it was, the atmosphere in the practice room was filled eminent violence.

“Tomitsuka-kun, please relax.”

Just as the situation became touch and go, Miyuki’s clear voice caused the atmosphere to calm down.

“Without approval from the Student Council President and the Public Moral Committee Chief, no duels are to be permitted. In addition, doesn’t Shippou-kun also need time to consider? And surely time to prepare the medium required to activate Million Edge, correct?”

“……That’s true. My apologies.”

Owing to Miyuki’s reprimand, Tomitsuka was slightly ashamed of his temporarily inflamed passions.

“Shippou-kun, can you stand?”

In place of Tomitsuka, who had retreated to a corner, Honoka walked in front of Takuma. Though she was still upset with Takuma’s rude display towards Tatsuya, she wasn’t going to abandon an underclassman on the ground because of that. Based on that point alone, one could tell that Honoka was far too kind.

“I’m fine!”

Takuma swiftly scrambled to his feet. His face was red because a girl he was trying to draw to his camp had seen him discomfited – that was how Takuma chose to view this.

“Shippou, I have no inclination to play along with you. Tomitsuka, if you want to have a match with Shippou, it would be best if you spoke with Hattori first.”

“Eh? Ah, you’re right.”

Tomitsuka’s response started strong but faded down the stretch. Takuma stared in sullen silence at Tatsuya.

“Honoka, I’m sorry, could I bother you to lock the door?”

“Of course, Tatsuya-san.”

Tatsuya was surrounded by an aura of “don’t trouble me any further” as he swiftly departed.

With only Miyuki in tow.



Unfortunately, Tatsuya wasn’t able to escape so easily.

It was approximately 15 minutes since Honoka locked the doors and returned to the Student Council Room. Just as Tatsuya got to his feet and was about to head for home, the doorbell to the Student Council Room rang.

“I’ll get it. Please come in.”

“Excuse me.”

After Azusa used the remote to disengage the lock, the one who came through the door was the Head of the Club Activities Group, Hattori.

Rather than saying he had a bad feeling, it was more appropriate to say that Tatsuya was sure something terrible was about to happen as he straightened in his chair.

Highly displeased, or maybe with a bitter scowl, Hattori walked towards Azusa.

Sitting at the desk, there was no hint of trepidation from Azusa’s part, a detail that surprised Tatsuya quite a bit.

“Nakajou, this is very difficult for me to say, or maybe I should say this is ridiculous……”

“Hattori-kun, what is the matter?”

In Azusa’s shoes, that was all she could say.

“I’m sorry, I need to request another permission slip for a match.”

“Again!? Who is it this time?”

Under these circumstances, the fact that Hattori said nothing defamatory about anyone was a testament to his character.

At the very least, he had a better sense of duty than Tatsuya, who had already foreseen this possibility and had chosen to protect himself by not reporting anything.

“It’s Tomitsuka and Shippou.”

“Shippou-kun again……?”

The deep creases in between Hattori’s brows indicated that he was of the same sentiment as Azusa.

“……I felt that there were a few problems with his attitude when he refused to join the Student Council. This time is the same, and to be honest, I think that he needs a serious beating to help him reflect.”

Miyuki and Honoka both nodded at this, but Hattori didn’t see them.

“Still, it’s a shame about his talent. I feel that if he was just a little more humble, he could be capable of great things.”

Again, Hattori missed the visual conversation between Miyuki and Honoka that went something like this “What do you think?” “Unlikely”.

“I think that in order to take him down a notch, making him suffer a little would be far more effective than chewing him out.”

“So that’s the reason behind this match…… Will Tomitsuka-kun be OK as the opponent? If it’s for that sort of reason, wouldn’t Sawaki-kun or even you yourself, Hattori-kun, be a little better?”

With Katsuto, Mayumi, and Mari graduating, the strongest students on the surface at First High turned into Hattori and Sawaki. (“Turned into” was just how the students phrased it, as there was no elimination tournament to determine this.)

“I considered teaching him a lesson myself, but Tomitsuka strongly requested for him to do it. Thus far, Tomitsuka has been responsible for training Shippou and he is definitely more than capable of doing this. Thus, this time I want to hand it over to him.”

“Is this really going to be OK?”

Isori had been sitting quietly by listening to Hattori up until now and lent his support.

“Tomitsuka-kun is very strong. Just as Hattori-kun said, he is definitely more than capable.”

Owing to the respective specialties of the two families, there was a substantial relationship between the Tomitsuka and Isori Families. Though their private relationship wasn’t close, there was nothing strange about Isori Kei knowing the limits of Tomitsuka Hagane’s might.

“Furthermore, Tomitsuka-kun has an earnest personality. Even under those circumstances, his personality didn’t become twisted. I think that it is unlikely that there would be an unwelcome result if we allowed him to have a match with Shippou-kun.”

Azusa knew about this, which was why she easily accepted Isori’s suggestion.

“What day do you want to request? The school is about to close today so that’s out of the question.”

In response to Azusa’s question, Hattori had prepared an answer ahead of time.

“Two days from now.”

“Is it OK if it’s not tomorrow?”

“That’s because I don’t want him to use continuous battles as an excuse. Leaving a day to prepare in between would be better.”

“Two days from now would be Saturday. I’m not sure the practice rooms will still be open after school……”

Azusa said this as she opened up the screen regarding facilities requests.

“Ah, there’s an opening at 3pm in Practice Room #3. Would one hour be enough?”

“Can you keep two hours open?”

“Hm~, no problem.”

Although she was a little surprised at Hattori’s request, Azusa still did as he requested and completed the scheduling request.

“Then, I will grant the permission slip ahead of time.”

“Sorry for bothering you.”

Hattori nodded to Azusa in thanks. Azusa snickered happily.

“……What’s so funny?”

“I feel that Hattori-kun is becoming more like Juumonji-senpai.”

To Azusa, this was undoubtedly praise. However, Hattori personally felt that he and Katsuto were two entirely different types of people. From his perspective, this was like saying he was imitating Katsuto to help bridge the gap between the two of them, something that definitely put him in an odd mood.




At the entrance to the living room, Miyuki was watching her brother sitting on the sofa after he had changed into casual clothes with worried eyes.

On the way home from school, Tatsuya seemed to be thinking about something. Still, this was just Miyuki’s personal feelings on the matter as Tatsuya’s attitude was no different than usual. He would respond any time he was asked. Not only would he respond when prompted, he also asked Minami for her thoughts on school life as well as whether today’s events were circulating among the Year 1 students.

However, despite everything appearing to be normal, Tatsuya was unquestionably troubled by something, Miyuki sincerely believed that. This was not whether she had observation skills, but the idea that her brother was troubled by something was passed to her heart.

This might be what they call a heart-to-heart connection.

Miyuki strongly felt that this was a recent development. At times she felt like this was telepathy, and at other times she didn’t. No matter what the truth behind this feeling was, Miyuki was overjoyed at this turnout. Just being able to feel connected to her brother’s heart filled Miyuki with happiness.

For Miyuki, to be able to detect her brother’s troubles was something to be cheerful about. However, precisely because of this, Miyuki paid extra heed to what Tatsuya was troubled about. Since she knew that her brother was upset, there was no way Miyuki would pretend to be oblivious.

“Onii-sama.”

In the end, Miyuki elected to ask him directly. Even if their hearts were connected, this wasn’t telepathy, so there was no way to read each other’s thoughts. Yet, even if she did have the power of telepathy, the idea of reading her brother’s thoughts was so preposterous to Miyuki that she would never do this. Even if there was something she could accomplish with her power, she could not serve as her brother’s strength if she did not know what to do. (As a side note, in the 21st century, research has proven that telepathy can only read superficial thoughts that had been converted into words.)

After receiving her brother’s permission, Miyuki sat directly across from Tatsuya and questioned Tatsuya with a quibbling expression on her face (that she was unaware of).

“Onii-sama, is something on your mind?”

Even if this was a direct strike, this sort of questioning was probably a little too direct. Even Tatsuya looked at his sister with a dumbfounded expression, though that might be precisely the reason why he didn’t try to muddy the issue.

“I’m just a little concerned about the circumstances surrounding Shippou.”

“……Onii-sama. If you ever feel that you’re unable to forgive his insolence, please let me know.”

“Wait, wait, Miyuki. Don’t be so hasty.”

Seeing the malicious glint flashing in the depths of Miyuki’s eyes that bordered on killing intent, Tatsuya frantically waved his hand left and right.

“Though it is true that guys’ attitude is very rude, I don’t mind in the slightest. Furthermore, when it comes to taking attitude with our elders, I’m in no position to say anything.”

“Nothing of the sort. Onii-sama is always the model of impeccable behavior.”

Although Tatsuya knew that this sort of response from Miyuki was practically reflex now, he wasn’t going to debate this point now.

“What concerns me is why Shippou is pushing himself so hard. Refusing to join the Student Council, tangling with the Saegusa Family, even willing to antagonize upperclassmen.”

“Isn’t this because he never thinks about anything?”

Hearing his sister’s fiery opinion, Tatsuya couldn’t help but laugh even though he knew that she was being serious.

“No, that doesn’t appear to be the case. Shippou has a powerful drive to elevate himself. Seeing him, I feel that he’s not someone who would be hung up about not being part of the Ten Master Clans.”

“……But if that’s the case then this doesn’t make sense. Normally, people would want to get into the Student Council to forge relationships.”

“I also think that would be normal.”

Miyuki seemed to have a revelation as she covered a corner of her mouth with one hand.

“Then, do you mean there’s something abnormal in the background? Is that what Onii-sama believes?”

“Well, that may be the case……”

Just as Tatsuya was hesitant about speaking, Minami stepped into the living room accompanied by a verbalized “Excuse me”.

In her hands, she held a tray holding several coffee mugs.

Seeing this, Miyuki wore an “Oh no” expression. Miyuki darted a malevolent expression at Minami, but Minami naturally averted her gaze as if she had not seen it.

“I brought the coffee.”

“Ah, thank you.”

Though Tatsuya was aware of the ongoing visual hostilities, he made no foolish venture to proactively intercede on this subject.

“That’s right, I also wanted to hear Minami’s opinion on this. Could you please take a seat?”

The reason Tatsuya said this was not because Minami was better than Miyuki at speculation.

Miyuki had been too heavily influenced by Tatsuya’s cognitive style. Her perspective on anything would share Tatsuya’s inclination on the subject. Tatsuya highly regarded this as a method to fill in the gaps of his own analysis, but now he wanted to hear the opinion from another perspective.

“Very well.”

Despite saying this, Minami failed to sit down and remained standing by the table side. In her, Tatsuya saw a rigid adherence to professionalism, so he didn’t waste any time pressing the issue.

“Minami, what is your impression of Shippou Takuma?”

“He is a foolish person who is unable to discern his own worth.”

Minami’s reply contained no trace of hesitation.

Across from Minami, Miyuki nodded her head with enthusiasm. Seeing this from the corner of his eye, Tatsuya reflected that “he asked the question poorly” and treated the ensuing headache as a misconception (not that it was really a physical headache anyways).

“—And the reason why you think this is?”

Tatsuya opted to listen to her rationale first.

In regards to this question, Minami again made no hesitation before answering.

“He’s like a mad dog. He bites while completely disregarding the difference in his opponent’s strength or the stakes. That sort of universal attacking stance is almost like he believes that he’s the strongest or he must be the strongest.”

Minami appeared to be quite outraged with Takuma as she atypically invested a lot of words to describe her opinion.

“Must be the strongest, eh……”

Though he had no way of telling how deeply Minami had thought of this, Tatsuya felt that her line of thinking might unexpectedly be the right one.

“So who is the one responsible for inciting him so?”

Tatsuya’s question was directed to neither Miyuki nor Minami. This was only to help organize his own thinking much like talking to oneself, but Miyuki misunderstood him.

“Incite…… Is it the educational policy of the Shippou Family? Like the eldest son of the Shippou Family must be stronger than anyone…… Or something like that.”

Strictly speaking, Miyuki’s hypothesis was more in line with the Yotsuba’s modus operandi. However, the three people present had so long been immersed in the Yotsuba doctrine that they remained unaware of this detail.

“No, I heard rumors that the head of the Shippou Family, Shippou Takumi, has a personality that is prudent enough to be called a little cowardly. If this is the Shippou Family’s policy, then even ignoring their true feelings for the moment, they should be a little more focused on self-preservation.”

“Tatsuya Onii-sama. I believe that rather than saying that Shippou Takuma has been incited onward, it may be more appropriate to say that this is the result of showering him with flattery.”

Miyuki was the one who reacted to Minami’s phrase.

“So there’s someone who doesn’t share Shippou-kun’s interests and is trying to use him?”

“I haven’t thought much on this level…… But I think what Miyuki Onee-sama said is correct.”

Next to where Miyuki was nodding in agreement with Minami’s words, Tatsuya also nodded internally. A crueler way of assessing Takuma was that he was being played for a fool. That was the sentence that came from Tatsuya’s heart when he thought about the series of events Takuma instigated.

“Definitely something to be concerned about. So what is their goal…… Maybe we should investigate?”

“Are you going to ask sensei?”

Miyuki asked if they were going to call on Yakumo, then,

“Need to send a line to Kuroba-sama?”

Minami proposed activating the Kuroba,

“No.”

To which Tatsuya shook his head to both ideas.

“I do not want to bother sensei over such a vague topic, nor can we ask for Oba-sama’s assistance. That being said, going solo is……”

Tatsuya shook his head as if to dispel the cobwebs.

“Leaving him alone gives me a bad premonition…… There’s nothing I can do, we can only wait and see for the moment.”

Though this was a very passive conclusion, Tatsuya could not think of any other alternative. If an act of violence occurred in front of him then he alone would be sufficient to handle it, but investigations required time and manpower. This was another case altogether with a hacker of Sanada or Fujibayashi’s skills, but right now he did not possess such abilities. Tatsuya honestly decided to give up, but……

The god (devil?) of trouble appeared to have chosen him to be their herald.

Just as Tatsuya finished his coffee and rose to his feet, the telephone rang. Checking the caller ID displayed on the monitor, Tatsuya furrowed his eyebrows in surprise. The one who called was Fujibayashi Kyouko.

“Hello, this is Shiba.”

Cooperating with his response, the monitor in the living room began to function like a video call in action.

“Tatsuya-kun, good evening. It shouldn’t be time for dinner yet. Do you have time to talk right now?”

“Yes, that’s no problem.”

As he replied back, Tatsuya signaled towards the other two next to him.

“Ah, both Miyuki and Minami-chan are welcome to listen in.”

That was normally the signal for the two of them to leave, but Fujibayashi acted first to have them stay. Was she trying to drag the two of them in, Tatsuya’s might be overthinking this, but he was alarmed at how knowledgeable Fujibayashi’s tone was when talking about Minami.

“In reality, this is in regards to the ruckus caused by the eldest son of the Shippou Family today.”

“Please wait a moment.”

Tatsuya interrupted Fujibayashi mid-sentence. The important news she was talking about was not something that he could just honestly accept from her without questioning.

“How do you know about this? Unlike the selection for the Nine Schools Competition, this wasn’t publicized at all. Don’t tell me you sent an agent to infiltrate First High?”

Hearing Tatsuya’s question, Fujibayashi’s expression was that of someone trying hard not to laugh.

“Looks like I should give her a reward. After all, Tatsuya-kun hasn’t noticed that he’s under observation.”

“Observing me, eh……”

Tatsuya wore a slightly darkened expression as he asked this.

“Hm~, actually a little different. Not observing you, but observing the people around you. Looks like she has faithfully adhered to the orders not to observe you or Miyuki. That’s probably why she has escaped Tatsuya-kun’s notice until now.”

“Why…… No, because I’m a Strategic-class Magician, right?”

“Why of course, isn’t that obvious? How could the military just leave a Strategic-class Magician all defenseless like that?”

Completely free of guilt, Fujibayashi readily admitted to checking in on him.

“Let’s just assume I asked who it is.”

“Of course, there’s no way I can tell you.”

Tatsuya sighed and gave up pursuing this subject. Originally, Tatsuya wasn’t exactly a member of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion with no strings attached. In addition, regardless of whether they were companions, he could understand the logic behind taking heed of a Strategic-class Magician’s movements.

“I understand…… So, what about Shippou?”

Seeing Tatsuya setting aside this conversation and wearing an expression as if the conversation up to this point had never happened, Fujibayashi adopted the same expression she wore when this phone call began.

“I’m just thinking, you wouldn’t happen to want to know who’s their support, would you?”

Just as before, she said a phrase that hinted that she overheard everything Tatsuya and company had just been discussing.

“……Why would you think that?”

However, even against Fujibayashi, Tatsuya wasn’t so lax that he missed the bugs planted in his own house. And even if his house had been tapped, Fujibayashi and her commander wouldn’t be so stupid as to allow Tatsuya to catch wind of this.

“The Shippou Family was one of the 18 replacement families that supported the Ten Master Clans. There was someone out there heavily influencing the son who would be inheriting that family. That existence was an unstable element that could not be ignored by the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion that saw magic as a critical element in national defense. Alternately, they had already obtained detailed information.”

In regards to Tatsuya’s question, she gave off the two answers he was expecting.

“Because I am interested.”

However, accepting this answer literally was quite dangerous. This was not entirely a lie, but at the same, it was not the entire truth.

“Then, want to go looking with me? I just wanted to propose that.”

Still, her proposal was exactly what he was looking for.

“Specifically speaking, what do I do?”

“Leave observing his dwelling to me. I was hoping Tatsuya-kun could pay a visit to Shippou-kun’s supporter.”

“I was actually hoping you would make that arrangement…… But why?”

“Because based on our jurisdiction, we should not be interfering with affairs within the nation. If it’s Tatsuya-kun, then can’t you use the excuse of an upperclassman at school acting out of concern for an underclassman? However, even under those circumstances, it’s not like we can ask a student to do something dangerous like that.”

“But I’m OK!?” A retort like that never materialized in Tatsuya’s mind.

“I understand. If that’s the case please allow me to offer my services.”

“I will contact you immediately if we detect any movement. Then Miyuki, based on the above conversation, I will be borrowing Tatsuya for a little bit.”

Hearing Miyuki’s flabbergasted confirmation, Fujibayashi said her goodbyes to Minami as she hung up the phone.





Chapter 15




“Who betrayed us……?”

Zhou Gongjin furrowed his delicate eyebrows and skimmed over the report that was automatically changing pages. Creases were appearing between his eyebrows. It was very rare for him to display his displeasure to this degree.

Just now, the date had changed from April 26th to April 27th. However, this was beneath his notice right now. This showed how intently Zhou Gongjin was studying the report in his hands.

Zhou Gongjin halted the scrolling and lifted his gaze from the information terminal. After lightly letting out a breath, he reached for the wine glass on the table.

This was already the third time he reviewed this report and failed to find any errors in its contents. Although he didn’t sincerely think that anything was wrong in the report, he needed to call on the assistance of a little alcohol to dispel the exhaustion brought on through a renewed verification of this unpleasant business.

This report was an investigation report regarding the progression of public opinion. Within, there were the results of using illegal methods to influence the impression non-Magicians held in regards to Magicians.

The report, quite the thick stack of papers if printed, displayed the rise in negative attitudes towards Magicians since the end of the previous year. The situation had noticeably worsened in the current month, a clear sign that his work on the media was reaping rewards.

Yet, this result failed to hit the expected parameters and clearly fell short of the level in his calculations. It was true that First High’s self-demonstrative actions played an unexpected role in this, but that degree of irregularity should not have caused the deviation between the projected and real values.

“Even if we factored in Rozen’s intervention that still doesn’t explain this…… As expected, the reason is because there are publicity programs that have not followed our directives.”

On the screen, he opened the daily totals for criticisms leveled at Magicians by various news sources. There, it was clear that not all had followed orders. In other words, among the televised news industries responsible for pushing the agenda that naturally included television, there were opponents who broke the agreement.

“To think they would do something so foolish like breaking our contract…… Violence does not align with my interests, but……”

Zhou only engaged in dealings on the black market, where no legally binding contracts existed. That was why he had to personally ensure that contractual obligations were fulfilled. Even if it was only a verbal agreement, no, precisely because it was a verbal agreement, he needed to employ a few tricks of his own – rewarding those who upheld their end of the bargain and punishing those who did not.

“Speaking of which, we have already entertained the cousins of Mr. Sun’s nephew for half a year now…… It’s about time to ask him to do a few things for us.”

As for the traitors’ punishment, Zhou elected to ask a friend to lend his assistance.




Friday, April 27th. Today, Takuma was absent from school.

He was still this year’s new student representative, thus making him quite a famous person among the Year 1 students. Many of his peers had heard about the incident that happened yesterday. With him absent the second day, all sorts of rumors flew through the floors of the Year 1 students.

—He huddled down at home after losing to the Saegusa siblings.

—No, no, he’s huddled at home because he was censured by the upperclassmen.

—While injured, the shock of the defeat caused him to shut himself at home.

—He won the match but had to take responsibility for causing the ruckus, so he chose to stay at home to reflect on his actions.

—In the end, he was sent home to do self-reflection as punishment, and now he’s home plotting his vengeance.

Among the rumors, the negative ones were in the majority, but some of them skirted close to the truth.

[Tatsuya Onii-sama. Takuma is also absent today.]

In light of this, after receiving Minami’s faithful report via e-mail about this, Tatsuya correctly surmised the reason behind this.

The truth of the matter and not the rumor was that Takuma had not been sent home to reflect as punishment. The (supposedly) correct portion of the rumors was that he was going to have a match with an upperclassman.

Known as magic exclusive to the Shippou Family, Million Edge was a Herd Control Magic that could be activated without a CAD. In essence, from the very beginning, the magic was a delayed sequence set in a state just short of activating and which used the caster’s psions as keys to unlock invocation. Setting aside the difficulty of Herd Control for the moment, the concept of using delayed magic to bypass the CAD process was not a rare phenomenon. For example, the “Magic Bullet Tathlum” wielded by the Kennedy Family in England was a magic founded on the same principles.

Million Edge’s uniqueness lay in the methods involved in creating the delayed state. Just short of activating, the technique was recorded down as incantations.

At first glance, this was the same method as replication techniques, but replication techniques required psions to flow into the incantations before constructing the Magic Sequence to achieve phenomenon alteration. In comparison to that, the Shippou Family’s magic was a conditionally activated delayed sequence that did not require a Magic Sequence. When facing an enemy, there was no need to allot time towards that process.

On the other hand, this required that the magic’s delayed sequence be recorded ahead of time. Replication only required the necessary information to construct the Magic Sequence, so even a machine could record the incantation. That was because it inherently shared the same properties as a CAD recording the Activation Sequence.

In addition, this record would be discarded after use. That was only natural given that it was a magic held prior to its invocation being released, which fundamentally differed with the “repeatedly usable magic record” that Tatsuya sought. In short, Million Edge was a sort of magic that required intense amount of preparation beforehand.

In order to prepare for tomorrow, Takuma should be hard at work preparing the activating medium for Million Edge. Since he was planning on winning the match tomorrow, he couldn’t be blamed for not coming to school today.

Speaking of which, the reason why Minami passed along Takuma’s movements was because Tatsuya had elected to join the investigation regarding Takuma’s supporters in the shadows. Minami was concerned that while Tatsuya was tied down during school, Takuma could be making contact with his supporters, but Tatsuya believed otherwise. Today was Friday. This was a time that even teenagers who were not magic high school students should be attending class. Even if he was not caught, wandering about on the streets would be awfully conspicuous. Plotting something nefarious (supposedly), Takuma would probably prefer to remain beneath the radar. Tatsuya believed that any contact with his shadowy support would be during the night. More importantly, Fujibayashi’s crew that was monitoring the situation would naturally contact them about any movements.

Thus, until night fell, Tatsuya played the part of the high school student intent on his studies.




“The reprisal target is Sawamura Yoshio. He is the CEO of Culture Communication Network, or Culture Net for short.”

Zhou spoke to the young man sitting on the other side of the table, Robert Sun, as he put a leather briefcase on the table.

Robert opened the lid of the briefcase. Inside, he found an automatic pistol, a large dagger, plastic explosives with a wireless detonator, and a bronze ring.

“You want me to take care of that man?”

In response to Robert’s emotionless question, Zhou ruefully smiled and shook his head.

“That was the original plan, but unfortunately Sawamura Yoshio is in Paris on business.”

As he said this, Zhou handed a large, paperbound notebook to Robert.

Robert flipped through the rarely seen paperbound notebook at will. There, a picture of a young woman along with her Personal Data were found.

“So you picked the daughter as the substitute.”

“I think that will send the proper message across.”

Pah, Robert closed the paperbound notebook and turned his eyes back to the briefcase. His gaze was fixated on the bronze Antinite the ring was forged with.

“Does she have Magicians as bodyguards?”

“Wouldn’t call him a bodyguard, but someone usually by her side. Still a child, but he’s someone from the 18 Replacement Families.”

“Is that so?”

Robert’s mouth turned into a vicious smirk.

“Magicians created by the Japanese military……”

Strictly speaking, Robert’s understanding here was faulty. The Ten Master Clans and the 18 Replacement Families included within the 28 families were all Magicians created by the Magician Development Research Labs and not actually created by the military. However, Zhou had no plan to correct such a trivial detail. For Robert, Magicians from the Japanese military owed his family a debt in blood. Zhou wasn’t foolish enough to dash the man’s rarely found, but burning, motivation.

“The preparations are detailed within. Though I can only provide rings for two, firearms and knives can be found for any number.”

“That’s enough. Leave it to me.”

Zhou Gongjin smiled widely as he watched Robert Sun stand up with cellphone, briefcase, and notepad.




After returning home, Tatsuya was engaged in a rare study session when he looked towards the ringing alarm clock on the corner of his desk. That was Fujibayashi’s signal. While he had not heard from her how she was observing the target, given that the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion was perpetually short on men, manpower was not a likely solution. More likely than not, she had invaded the personal identification program within the Street Observation System and was watching for Takuma to leave. If so, he was an accomplice to illegal use of public programs to invade privacy, but Tatsuya felt no guilt whatsoever. It wasn’t like they were peeking in on the household, Tatsuya rationalized.

Rather than setting morals aside, it would be more appropriate to say that sort of feeling never registered with Tatsuya as he stood from his chair. Of course, this was in order to rendezvous with Fujibayashi. After leaving Miyuki and Minami to watch the house and giving strict orders for them not to follow, Tatsuya got onto his beloved electric motorcycle.



Before the eyes of Tatsuya and company, Takuma’s silhouette vanished into a medium sized building filled with upper class condominiums. He remained unaware that he was being followed. At the very least, he took heed to avoid being tailed, but his ability to detect hidden presences was quite raw.

“Looks like the head of the Shippou Family chose not to send his son through military training.”

“We might call it military, but it really only covers training for intelligence operatives. Speaking of which, why is Captain Sanada here with Lieutenant Fujibayashi?”

Tatsuya parked the motorcycle at the train station and was currently sitting in the back seat of a large limousine where they were observing Takuma enter the apartment. Next to him, Fujibayashi had an information terminal the size of a small calculator on her lap while Sanada was in the driver’s seat manipulating the large touchpad.

“Talented but on rotten footing with the Ten Master Clans. Wouldn’t he be a perfect fit in our unit?”

Sanada turned his head from the driver’s seat to answer. Somewhat surprised, Tatsuya raised an eyebrow.

“Are you planning on inviting that guy into the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion?”

“Ara, is Tatsuya-kun against it? If you don’t like Shippou-kun, then I guess we will just have to abandon that idea.”

Tatsuya scowled in irritation at Fujibayashi’s words.

“What is this? You’re talking like I have the power to decide that.”

“After all, ‘Special Lieutenant Ooguro Ryuuya’ boasts the greatest firepower within our unit. We can hardly afford to ruin your mood.”

This was of course a joke on Fujibayashi’s part. Still, getting upset here would get him nowhere, Tatsuya’s instincts told him.

“……It’s not like I dislike Shippou. So long as he does not cause trouble, I do not care what he does. Those are my feelings on the matter.”

“So, you’re not the type who is interested in fostering disagreements?”

Tatsuya ignored Fujibayashi’s meaningless interjection.

“……So why did you lend your assistance for this investigation?”

Taking over for Fujibayashi, Sanada’s question was perfectly legitimate, so this time Tatsuya broke his silence.

“If the ones behind him are similar to the guys from Blanche from before, then even settling Shippou would only cause another problem child to appear.”

Halfway through Tatsuya’s words, Fujibayashi burst into laughter. She was probably thinking “Who is the real problem child here?” – Tatsuya didn’t mind that overly much.

“I see. Shippou-kun being naughty would actually be within acceptable parameters, but a second, third, or fourth would be dejecting.”

“Maybe not dejecting…… But that’s how it is.”

The voice that Tatsuya used to answer Sanada seemed to be laced with sighs.

“Ah, looks like they’re starting to talk, want to listen in?”

Fujibayashi asked Tatsuya with headphones over one ear. It appeared that the monitoring device planted on Takuma was beginning to catch his conversation with his “partner in the shadows”.

(Pretending to be a passerby, Fujibayashi planted the monitoring device on Takuma as she walked by him.)

“Yeah, please do.”

Hearing Tatsuya’s response, Fujibayashi laughed in delight as she switched the volume over to the car’s speakers.




In general, Takuma usually wore a displeased expression. At least in Sawamura Maki’s eyes, Takuma was just that sort of young man. Even when he was talking about taking the top score on the entrance exam and becoming the new student representative, he never wore an expression of someone in a “good mood”.

However, today his mood was even worse than usual. Although he was trying to adopt his usual expression, Maki saw right through him. There was no way he could fool a professional actress trained to fake expressions, not to mention this was Maki, who, along with her natural beauty, was also #1 among new actors for her “face” that could act out every emotion possible on the silver screen.

“Takuma. I haven’t dined yet today. Would you like to accompany me?”

If they cut right to the chase, she would probably have to listen to him complain until he had vented all his frustration. At present, Maki planned to use “dinner” as the means to buy some time for him to cool down.

“At this hour? Wouldn’t that harm your appearance?”

“That’s why it will only be a light one. It’s almost done, so I’ll go get it now.”

Maki mentally awarded Takuma bonus points for not saying something impolite like “get fat” and walked towards the dining room.

She brought some snacks with thinly cut strips of bread with ham, salmon, tomatoes, and avocados on top. The meal certainly looked light, but there was no guarantee that the calories were also light.

Takuma had already eaten dinner, but he still took part in the snacks Maki made without hesitation. He was still at a growing age, so there were no worries about any disposition towards growing chubby.

For the next five minutes or so, Takuma’s mouth was engaged in eating and drinking. In order to swallow the slightly salty snacks, Takuma was greedily consuming juice that he was unaware was tinged with alcohol. Nor did he notice the minute amount of sweet wine added into the snacks themselves.

When the “light meal” on the plates had just about been cleaned aside by Takuma, Maki used the voice of an “openhearted older sister” to strike a conversation with Takuma. (As a side note, this was when Fujibayashi switched over to the speakers.)

Normally unwilling to reveal his weaker side, Takuma was particularly chatty tonight for some unknown reason.



“……So, that’s what happened. Takuma, you must feel like that was a lost opportunity.”

Maki’s melodious voice would have caused any fan to swoon as she comforted Takuma. Right now, she was sitting next to Takuma on the 3 person sofa as she laid a hand on his shoulder while scooting her face next to his while they were speaking.

“Forget lost opportunity! That was an unfair outcome from the very start! If that continued, my victory was guaranteed!”

Since beginning to speak, Takuma had already repeated this several times, but Maki hung around without any sign of irritation.

“Why of course, Takuma. In reality, you were the one who won. You should have won the respect and accolade that goes to the victor. The fact this was not so was simply because you were unlucky.”

“Unlucky……?”

“Indeed. Although some people say that luck is also a talent, they are wrong. Those with true strength will ultimately prevail regardless of luck. However, a tiny match like this is very much subject to luck. There were also a few times where I unluckily got handed the poor roles.”

Maki kept one hand on Takuma’s shoulder while her other was laid on top of Takuma’s fingers.

Soft flesh gently caressed Takuma’s skin while the scent of honey stimulated his sense of smell.

“So that’s why you’ll be fine, Takuma. Yesterday was just bad luck for you. Such a small defeat will not impact your future.”

“Really……?”

Despite repeating these words multiple times, Takuma finally exhibited a different reaction. Mentally sighing in relief, Maki felt that she only needed one more gentle push.

“Of course. So you need to get back on your feet.”

Maki drew Takuma’s hand to her own knee. Although seduction was against her principles, seeing Takuma so weak like this roused Maki’s teasing side.

Takuma’s hand gradually slid from Maki’s knee to her thigh, all according to Maki’s plan. She wore a loose gown that opened from the front. Though the sleeves were long, her bosom was wide open as the fabric was thin enough to allow hints of flesh to peek through. Through the dress, the feel of Maki’s flesh was transferred to Takuma’s hand, further chipping away at his self-control that was already unraveling due to the alcohol that lowered inhibitions.

Takuma flung aside Maki’s hand and retracted the hand on her thigh.

In the next instant, his hands grabbed Maki’s shoulders.

Maki only made token resistance to the strength that was pushing her down.




“Ara ara, now we have a show.”

In response to the plainly interested Fujibayashi, the flabbergasted look Tatsuya sent her way – failed to happen. He was neither dumbfounded by her behavior nor did he send a condescending look her way. Speaking of which, Tatsuya wore a completely uninterested look that was a far cry from blushing with excitement.

“This might be a good opportunity.”

As he listened to the sonorous voice coming across the monitoring device, Tatsuya spoke in a chilling tone.

“Hm, did you think of a ploy of some sort?”

With a highly entertained look on her face, Fujibayashi asked Tatsuya with deep interest.

“Recently, hasn’t the media been in an uproar about an actress soliciting a younger man?”

Tatsuya spoke in the objective tone he normally used.

“……Blackmail?”

Fujibayashi’s smile finally turned a little stiff.

“On occasion, we should use the media to our advantage.”

“……Can’t believe you were able to immediately make that sort of connection.”

Sanada could devise the most vicious traps when it came down to his own techniques, but here his expression seemed to spasm as he expressed his own feelings. Still, he placed emphasis on the word “immediately”, so he probably would have come up with this idea given sufficient time.

“Actually allowing him to go through with that would damage the school’s image and may not be usable as a bargaining chip, so let’s act while this is still in the realm of attempted.”

Never faltering even in the face of Fujibayashi and Sanada’s reactions, Tatsuya lightly made this proposal.




After being pressed into the sofa by Takuma, Maki calmly observed him from this position. The delighted expression she wore wasn’t entirely feigned. Though still less than Takuma, the alcohol in her own body had also dulled the brakes of logic. However, even though her eyes were slightly drunk, she was still soberly surveying the dazed young man pressing down on top of her. Maki had long since developed the skill to separate her body’s feelings with her mental exhilaration.

Thus Maki noticed the oddity even if Takuma remained oblivious. The screen door leading to the porch opened with a slight sound. Needless to say, the door was clearly locked but had now been pried open. Before all that, the porch was protected with a security system that had the greatest firepower permissible within the boundaries of the law, but had apparently been penetrated.

There was no sound of the alarm going off. The bodyguards were completely unaware.

“Help! Thief!”

Deeply regretting her overreliance on the security system, Maki screamed as she pushed Takuma aside.

Rolling on the floor, Takuma reacted to her cries.

He looked in the direction that Maki was watching after frantically getting to her feet. However, faster than he could identify the thief, his face was subjected to light contact. By the time he recognized that someone had thrown something at him, the irresistible Morpheus stole over Takuma as he once more fell to the floor.

“Takuma!?”

Owing to a burst of anxiety, her sleeve covered the corner of her mouth, causing the despairing cry to become muffled. She was very clear as to why Takuma fell unconscious. That was a trick of filmmaking, and she had seen the real deal while inspecting the props. The item that struck Takuma on the face was a soft ball soaked in highly effective sleeping medication. The duration of the medicine was very short, but that being said, he would be completely out of it for the next 5 to 10 minutes.

Trying to keep a lid on her terror, Maki looked towards the porch. The screen door and window had already been closed. Before the door stood a figure wearing a black mask dressed entirely in darkness as he or she was folding up the wings attached to their back. –That silhouette was practically straight out of the old films that used a bat as an inspiration. If only the mask had had “ears” on top, it would have looked exactly like that. In fact, this garb was made from the camouflage material that absorbed electric waves, but of course Maki didn’t know that.

“Milady, are you alright!?”

Now the two bodyguards burst into the living room. This was precisely when the stranger dropped the folded wings to the floor. Without verifying the stranger’s posture, the two female guards saw him as a burglar and rushed him.

Maybe this was all because only one ball soaked in sleeping medicine had been prepared. The thief in black never moved from his location and met the charge. The bodyguards held police batons used for indoors combat. These were not simple rods, as police batons had handles made of elastic material and the sharp end wrapped in plastic had increased weight so the weapon could be used like a club or short rods.

The stranger easily caught the bodyguards’ downward blow of the police baton. Without using the arm, the stranger used a glove-covered hand.

One diagonal step away, the other bodyguard had to loop around to the window in order to avoid obstructing the first one and was now in a position where only one of her two police batons could attack. In that case, only one weapon was in position to be a threat. Catching that baton would immediately restrict their movement, so he swung his fist towards the bodyguard who could not escape.

The female bodyguard was sent flying.

Seeing the fighting power of someone on an entirely different level, the other female bodyguard couldn’t help but shake a little.

But the stranger was utterly merciless.

He once again swung a black fist.

Without being able to avenge herself, Maki’s bodyguard was neutralized.



Standing before Maki, who was so terrified that she couldn’t sit up straight, the stranger spoke in a voice that Maki felt she had heard before.

“Do arrange your attire.”

It was only after he said this that Maki remembered she was partially unclothed. The dress had been pulled down so only the sleeves were unhelpfully covering her body. Thankfully her underclothes were still playing their part, but traces of her earlier activities could be seen all over her exposed flesh.

“Ah, mind if I cover myself?”

Maki put in all of her efforts to keep her body from shaking and put on a performance from early in her career that garnered rave reviews from her producer regarding her “graceful poise.” If the stranger before her was a young man like she imagined, he would have pounced on her immediately. Although she had no idea what he was here for, so long as they developed that sort of relationship then she had the upper hand.

Yet, all of her plans were stumped at the very first step. Nay, she couldn’t even reach the first step.

“Of course. Eh, if you feel that you’re fine as you are, I don’t care in the slightest.”

Maki felt like someone doused her in cold water. The damage to her pride caused a cold fury to press down her fear. She arranged her clothing with an enraged look on her face.





“……That’s better. Speaking of which, how long are you planning to wear that thing? It doesn’t suit you at all, Shiba Tatsuya-kun.”

The item Maki spoke of when she used a tone that warned Tatsuya not to take her for a fool was the black mask he wore while posing as Batman – that was actually a newly developed helmet made of soft materials. However, the part she really wanted to drop was the “Shiba Tatsuya-kun” portion. In other words, “I know your real identity”, except that Maki was cognizant of the fact that even hidden beneath the mask, Tatsuya’s expression didn’t flinch at all. More like he was doing this to let her know.

“Then let us begin negotiating.”

Tatsuya ignored Maki’s provocation as if it was perfectly natural.

“Negotiate? To what end?”

Maki did not insist on respect due to her. Right now, she was firmly standing in the weaker corner. Based on the earlier scene, violence was out of the question and feminine wiles had no effect. Maki knew that her options were limited.

“First, please listen to this.”

Maki was a little uneasy when his choice of words became polite. However, that thought fled from her mind when she heard the voices emitting from the information terminal in Tatsuya’s hand.

Those were the voices of her and Takuma as they were entwined on the sofa.

“You were eavesdropping!? You pervert!”

Maki couldn’t help but deliver her outrage despite how dangerous her statement was in her situation. Though she immediately thought “Oh no!”, she was unable to control her involuntary reaction.

“I’m sure this would prove to be a major problem if leaked to the media.”

However, once she heard Tatsuya’s words after he stopped the recording, Maki froze in a way that was far cooler than calmness.

“Recently, there was a similar firestorm all over the news…… Apparently even a former idol past her prime can cause such a ruckus, not to mention a beautiful actress in her prime.”

“What are your demands!?”

Maki curtailed Tatsuya’s words as she screamed hysterically. In comparison to the young man standing before her with his vile threats, Maki was far more furious with her own carelessness.

“I have two conditions.”

In complete contrast to Maki, Tatsuya made his declaration in a placid tone. His light baritone continued to trigger Maki’s unease.

“First, break it off with Shippou. Ah, and I don’t mean that way so don’t play coy with me.”

“I understand.”

She was shot down just as Maki was about to lead the topic into that direction, to which she could only nod with a sullen voice.

“Second, please stop your activities with high school students and below.”

“……What do you mean?”

Maki wasn’t feigning obliviousness here. She was honestly confused as to the intent behind Tatsuya’ request. Even if she could understand his meaning, she still remained in the dark as to why he would make such a request.

“I am unaware of the details behind your little plan. Maybe there is some benefit to Magicians, but I am entirely uninterested. However, can you please stop taking action in my immediate surroundings?”

“Eh……?”

Completely dumbfounded, Maki gazed back at Tatsuya behind his mask.

“Anyone in college and up is already an adult, so I do not plan on interfering regardless of what you do. However, that is all under the prerequisite that you are not acting against me. Will you accept these conditions?”

“Eh, hm…… If that’s all there is.”

She suddenly felt drained. For just this, he was willing to act like a bandit, she thought.

On the other hand, she felt terror clawing at her. Illegal entry, battery, blackmail. Every one of the things he did was unquestionably a felony in the eyes of the law. Yet, he never hesitated in performing these acts for mere trivialities.

This young man cared not a whit for the laws or authority of the country……

Maki suddenly came upon a revelation.

“Who the devil are you……?”

She asked in trepidation. Logic told her that not asking would be the right choice. Still, she couldn’t be blamed for being unable to swallow that question. Tonight, for the first time, she truly understood how terrifying people with unknown backgrounds were.

“I will erase these files based on the degree of your cooperation in regards to my conditions.”

She did not receive a meaningful answer.

“Thank you for joining me in this highly meaningful negotiation.”

Tatsuya once more put on the “things that looked like folded wings” before dropping these arrogant words and stepping out onto the porch.

Maki frantically followed right behind him.

The figure of the young man in black had completely vanished from the porch.




From above, Tatsuya verified Maki looking down from the porch before moving his body back. Currently, he was standing on the building’s roof. The original plan called for him to use the glider he wore on his back to descend to ground level, but that plan was now subject to change after detecting a suspicious shadow in the sky.

The shadow belonged to a small flying boat. For an instant, Tatsuya thought this was related to the incident from two months ago regarding a certain invisible flying ship belonging to one of the Intelligence Departments from the JSDF, but he knew he was mistaken upon taking in the shape of the hull. The shape of this flying ship denoted that it was the type used by news agencies or film companies to take aerial photographs. However, surely they were up to no good after painting the entire vessel black. If this black ship belonged to one of the film companies, Tatsuya was sure that their goal would be to take covert photography.

“Lieutenant, do you see the flying ship on direct approach for Sawamura Maki’s apartment building?”

“Yes, I caught them. I was watching them since Tatsuya-kun visited the young actress’s room. Still, never thought that they would be descending.”

“Do you know who they belong to?”

“Based on its flight plan, it should belong to one of the television companies.”

The corporate name that came from Fujibayashi’s mouth was an entertainment station from the southern Kantou area. Apparently, they were listed as the competitor of one of the companies purchased by the group run by Maki’s father.

“So they’re probably looking for dirt on Sawamura Maki.”

“The probability is not zero.”

Fujibayashi’s voice was filled with disgust, likely a reaction caused by covert photography.

“Lieutenant, can you turn off the psion radar around this area? Five minutes will be enough.”

“You plan on halting the covert photography?”

“Affirmative.”

On the other hand, Tatsuya planned on interfering with the covert photography because he didn’t want to waste the time and effort spent negotiating with Maki. If Takuma was covertly photographed in Maki’s room, that would be enough for a scandal even if they weren’t caught in the act.

“Give me three minutes and I’ll have it done.”

It was Sanada’s voice that conveyed that to Tatsuya.

“Understood.”

Tatsuya used his right hand to pull out his favored weapon, the custom Silver Horn “Trident” and peered at the flying ship just as the ship opened a door to let down a rope ladder.

So not only are they engaged in covert photography but illegal entry as well, Tatsuya mentally murmured to himself while completely disregarding what he just did earlier and activated Leaping magic towards the opened doorway on the flying ship.



Tatsuya was unable to understand the angry retorts coming from the flying ship after he charged in. Although he felt it didn’t sound like any language from East Asia, Tatsuya was not someone who spoke Beijing or Guantong dialects.

However, he understood immediately that the situation was not what he had imagined it to be. The fact that the men pointing guns at him were not from the television companies was blatantly obvious.

Of course, Tatsuya did not permit them to fire since his right hand was holding the ready-to-fire Trident. Switching decomposition targets barely took him any time.

There were five muzzles pointed at Tatsuya.

All of them lost their shapes as guns before clattering to the deck of the flying ship.

After getting hit by Tatsuya’s Decomposition Magic, the men reacted with surprising speed.

The two men standing to the left and right of Tatsuya swung their fists. On their middle finger, they each wore a bronze ring that shone with light. Immediately, the interior of the flying ship was suffused with psion noise. That was the sign of Cast Jamming brought on by Antinite vibrations.

Two men on the inside brandished daggers as they closed in on Tatsuya across the wobbly deck.

Tatsuya squeezed the finger around the CAD’s trigger twice.

Immediately after the magic that decomposed information structure wiped out the noise from Cast Jamming, all five miscreants fell to the deck with holes in their two legs.

However, the situation was not finished. Tatsuya saw that the man in the center had his left hand tightly clasped around something before he fell.

After being flung through the open door in the flying ship, Tatsuya fell through the sky.

In the next instant, a flash erupted with the sound of an explosion as the flying ship was covered in flames.

Tatsuya knew that falling down from such a height was no joke, but right now there was something far more pressing than his safety. There would be a major accident if that flying ship crashed onto the streets outside the apartments.

Amid the buffeting wind, Tatsuya turned his body around and pointed the CAD Trident at the flying ship with a broken balloon.

Falling from the sky, he activated Mist Dispersal.

Seeing the remnants of the flying ship fade away into dust, Tatsuya remembered to use inertia control magic. Immediately, Tatsuya felt a powerful impact strike his back.



The place where Tatsuya fell was the rooftop of a building that did not belong to Maki’s apartment. The height of the building lowered the distance of the fall, partial activation of inertia control magic coming into effect and the glider on his back served as a buffering cushion. All three factors combined to prevent Tatsuya from suffering a full body fracture. Still, if not for “Restoration” activating, Tatsuya would probably have spent the rest of his life without ever getting to his feet again.

“Tatsuya-kun, what the hell just happened!?”

Even Fujibayashi’s voice coming across the intercom had turned frantic.

“I’m not sure. However, I think we’ll find some clues at the television company. That flying ship appeared to have been hijacked.”

Tatsuya’s unhappy voice also added that “though it might not be a hijacking and that the television company was their accomplice” before he erased any trace of his fall and stood up on the roof.




The news that the attack on Sawamura Maki that Robert Sun was responsible for had failed quickly reached the ears of Zhou Gongjin. If this operation had succeeded, then the subordinate responsible for passing along the pictures of a daughter completely savaged beyond all recognition to the unfortunate father would have reported this to Zhou.

(To completely erase an enflamed flying ship as it fell from the sky…… The only one who could do something like this……)

Unfortunately, no pictures were taken. There was nothing that could be gleamed from his subordinate’s report, but based on the piece of information about the ship disappearing from the sky, Zhou correctly inferred the identity of the man who interfered with their operation.

(……Damn him. It’s that man again.)

Though they knew of him, all they knew about him was the figure of him wearing a helmet to cover his face along with names like “Demon Right” and “Mahesvara”.

During the “Yokohama Incident”, the invasion force he had provided assistance to had also suffered terribly at the hands of this unknown Magician. The tremendous resistance coming from “Mahesvara” was literally one of the major reasons why the invasion plan failed.

The losses incurred by the Great Asian Alliance during the Yokohama Incident weren’t exactly a loss for Zhou. Originally, he had hoped that the Japanese and Great Asian Alliance forces would bleed each other dry. The Japanese forces winning there ran counter to his expectations, but the weakening of the Great Alliance went according to his wishes on some level.

However, this time Zhou couldn’t just laugh it off so easily.

(Looks like there is a need to uncover who he is.)

As Zhou thought along these lines, he also felt that it was time for a change in direction in regards to the media operation currently ongoing.

(In the end, the Master’s true feelings on the matter are to have his revenge against the people responsible for bringing out Great Han…… The real target is not such a vague organization like “Japanese Magicians”, but that clan in particular.)

And Zhou had an inkling as to who among those in power bore special interest towards “that clan”.

(Though this isn’t something outrageous like driving a wedge between the two, this might be worth trying.)

Zhou looked at a wine glass that didn’t have a beak as he began to plot in his mind.





Chapter 16




Saturday, April 28th, 3pm sharp.

Under Hattori’s guidance, Tomitsuka and Takuma found themselves in Practice Room #3 at the appointed hour.

Hattori was the referee for this match. Possibly out of curiosity regarding the casual relationship or simply a natural turn of events, Tatsuya was also present for Takuma’s match as a witness.

Still, from Tatsuya’s perspective, Takuma seemed to be free of any lingering side effects, both physically and mentally. The actress must have wrapped things up quite well on her end. Yet, at the same time, it was only reasonable to assume she had not formally “broken off” from him. For now, Tatsuya believed that additional observation was necessary.

Others present included Miyuki from the Student Council, Sawaki and Mikihiko from the Public Moral Committee, Kirihara from the Club Activities Group as well as other elites. Kirihara even brought his wooden sword and had received permission to bring his CAD.

They were here to forcibly intervene if necessary.

That was because this match carried a few special rules. To be precise, special exceptions like “unrestricted use of Million Edge” were added into the rules. In regards to Million Edge, usage would be permitted regardless of how powerful the spell became. Intervention into the match would only occur when the opponent would blatantly suffer injuries as a result. Nevertheless, the one who proposed this ruling was Tomitsuka, Takuma’s opponent for this match.

It was possible that Tomitsuka had a trick up his sleeve to completely neutralize Million Edge. Highly put out, Takuma had also rationalized along those lines. This was practically saying that the Shippou Family’s trump card was worthless. Still, this match was the result of Takuma protesting his defeat via disqualification, with the reason being his use of Million Edge. Hence Takuma welcomed the current rules with open arms and had no cause for complaint.

Currently, Tomitsuka and Takuma stood facing another across a broad stretch of space.

Today, Takuma also wore the uniform designed for outdoor exercises.

On the other hand, Tomitsuka wore the uniform for the Magic Martial Arts Club. The top half contained a long tunic without buttons that had padding around the forearms while the bottom half had pads around the knees as well as loose pants that only tightened around the ankles. On his feet, he wore soft sneakers used during fighting competitions. With protective gloves over both hands, all 8 fingers besides the two thumbs were wearing thick rings that served as the Specialized CAD input devices for the Magic Martial Arts Club. Each ring corresponded to one button and when the fingers moved (pressed by the thumb) or psions gathered around his fingertips, the signal for the Activation Sequence selected by his fingertips would be passed through the glove to the connecting CAD around his wrist. In other words, Tomitsuka had prepared himself very seriously.

Standing between the two of them, Hattori reviewed the rules. Not that there was anything in particular he had to explain as this was just a formality.

Quieting the two, Hattori raised his hand.

Tense anxiety suddenly spiked here. Everyone present could feel the furious clash of nonphysical waves, not psion waves, between Tomitsuka and Takuma.

Tomitsuka slightly fell into a crouch. Takuma placed his right hand on the book serving as his medium that was being carried in his left hand.

Besides the two in question, no one moved a muscle or emitted a sound. In the utter silence of the classroom, even Hattori breathing deeply in could be heard.

“Begin!”

Hattori’s voice shattered the stillness and quiet.



The first one to move was Takuma.

Or rather, Tomitsuka neglected to act.

Takuma opened his “book” and used the fingers on his right hand to pinch several dozen pages. Takuma proceeded to rip those pages to shreds. Scratch that, in the process of applying force, he was turning the pages into paper snowflakes.

There were approximately 80,000 paper blades that measured 4cm by 4cm. Rather than choosing to unleash Million Edge in its entirety, Takuma chose the finesse strategy and only wielded a small portion of his blades.

In response, Tomitsuka remained motionless as he watched the paper squares gradually close in on him. Based on his posture, he appeared to be gathering power. That appeared to be an accurate assessment.

The white paper squares dipped and soared as they advanced, like four giant snakes crawling through the clouds. The targets for their fangs were the left and right arms along with both legs. Takuma planned to first damage Tomitsuka’s limbs to immobilize him.

The current of paper drew closer to Tomitsuka as the paper snowflakes decreased in length and grew in density. The attack stalled briefly before immediately picking up speed. The storm of paper blades wrapped around Tomitsuka’s limbs with the intent of shredding his flesh.

At the same moment.

Tomitsuka’s entire body flashed with an explosive psion light. Amid that blinding light, the paper blades faded back to being normal paper. All 80,000 paper squares lost their magic power to float in mid-air before returning to true paper snowflakes and falling to the ground.

Sawaki, Kirihara, Mikihiko and company couldn’t help but raise an arm to block the light. Tatsuya, Miyuki, and Hattori all narrowed their eyes.

They knew exactly what that light signified.

“Was that Gram Demolition……?”

Mikihiko murmured in an astounded voice.

“So someone other than Tatsuya is able to use that in our school……? And someone in the same grade level at that……?”

Gram Demolition was perceived to be a rare ability that only a few users had access to. This wasn’t Mikihiko jumping to conclusions, as this was both the truth and general consensus. He could hardly be blamed for his shock that there were two such individuals at the same school in the same year.

“To be precise, I believe the term Contact-Type should be added before that phrase.”

Miyuki was the one who supplemented Mikihiko’s words.

“You are exactly right! As expected of Shiba-san, to be so knowledgeable on the subject!”

Sawaki nodded overtly when he heard her words.

“Speaking of which, Tomitsuka seems exceptionally fired up today.”

As his senior from the Club Activities Group, Sawaki knew that Tomitsuka would use what Miyuki termed “Contact-Type Gram Demolition”. This technique neutralized any magic that came into contact with his body. For a spell like Million Edge that used magic to continuously alter phenomena in order to convert plain paper into blades dancing in the wind, this was practically its nemesis.

Sawaki understood very well that Tomitsuka proposed these rules because he had complete confidence in himself. Sawaki himself was wary against Tomitsuka’s Gram Demolition, but today Tomitsuka seemed even more vibrant than usual. This fact brought considerable joy to Sawaki. —As such, Sawaki also had a youthful aspect to him as well.

However, unlike the upperclassmen in attendance, Takuma had no time to feel impressed. He knew very well the meaning behind that earlier exchange: Million Edge was useless against Tomitsuka.

He only needed one attack to understand that.

(—No, it’s true that direct assaults are useless! But two days ago, I just learned that different applications of the same magic will achieve differing results!)

Tomitsuka’s eyes were pinned on him as Takuma bolstered his own confidence. Currently, there were openings all over Takuma. If Tomitsuka intended to, he could end the match in an instant. However, that would be pointless, as Tomitsuka knew that he couldn’t finish this match in such a simple manner.

Finally, Takuma adopted a new pose. In response, Tomitsuka also raised the psions’ activity level. Takuma’s hand pretended to flip the pages as it surreptitiously stretched towards the CAD on his wrist.

The magic he activated was Air Bullet. Takuma sent seven Air Bullets shooting towards Tomitsuka at high speeds.

Without waiting to see the result, Takuma activated the next magic. Takuma never even considered that Air Bullets alone could defeat Tomitsuka. This attack only served as a smokescreen. Takuma used personal Acceleration Magic to loop around to Tomitsuka’s flank.

Yet, Tomitsuka was already waiting for Takuma at his intended destination.

“Kuh, oof!”

He directly took the combination of a heavy punch and a left hook. Unable to keep his feet, Takuma fell to the floor. It was only out of sheer obstinacy that he still clung to the book that served as his medium. Takuma called upon his fighting spirit to dispel his blurred vision as he searched for Tomitsuka’s figure.

Tomitsuka didn’t follow up on his attack as he looked downwards at Takuma. Normally, this nice guy’s face seemed a tad childish, but it now wore a derisive expression as he looked upon him like one looks upon a mad dog — looking at him. In Takuma’s eyes, that was the current situation.

The sudden flare of heightened emotions surpassed his fear for the moment. One knee on the ground, Takuma used his left hand to flip through the book.

The first attack on Tomitsuka contained twice as many paper squares as the previous assault. This time the squares weren’t split into four groups but gathered into one swarm. The greater the number of the “herd” in Herd Control, the lower the interference strength. By gathering the Magic Power from all four portions into one, Takuma was going to challenge Tomitsuka’s Gram Demolition directly.

—Which was actually a feint, as the true blow was the next attack that was activated a moment later.

Bathed in the light released by Tomitsuka, 16,000 paper squares turned into paper snowflakes and fell to the floor.

As if bursting through the clouds, the 20,000 paper blades that were released after a moment’s delay roared towards Tomitsuka’s feet like a tornado.

Got him, Takuma thought. Gram Demolition was an ability that released a massive amount of psions at a time. Not only were they released, pressure sufficient to blow away a Magic Sequence was also required. There was no way he could use this repeatedly in such a short time.

However, Takuma’s theory was in error. The moment that he realized that this was wishful thinking instead of a theory was quite a long time from now.

Twenty thousand blades were rendered into 20,000 paper scraps the instant they came into contact with Tomitsuka’s body.

In regards to Takuma, who had just gotten back to his feet, Tomitsuka bestowed upon him the deciding blow of the match.



“That’s enough. The victor is Tomitsuka.”

After Hattori announced the winner’s name, Tomitsuka bowed slightly.

Afterwards, he fell to one knee next to Takuma lying prone on the floor.

“Shippou, are you awake?”

Takuma groaned in what seemed like considerable pain, signifying his conscious state. That was because Tomitsuka intentionally struck him in such a manner and all went according to his plan.

“Thank you.”

After coughing a few times, Takuma finally answered the question.

“Then, go ahead and sit against the wall to rest a while.”

“—Got it.”

Overcome by the magnitude of his defeat, Takuma obeyed Tomitsuka’s instructions without comprehending the reason behind them. Clutching the area around his abdomen where he had been struck, he tottered and staggered to the wall opposite from where the witnesses stood. Leaning against the wall, Takuma gradually slid to the floor.

After verifying that Takuma had reached that side, Tomitsuka walked towards Tatsuya.

“……What is it?”

After Tatsuya’s question, the hitherto taciturn Tomitsuka finally opened his mouth.

“Shiba-kun, I wish for a match against you!”

Drawing back to survey this article that was so difficult to verbalize, Tatsuya tilted his head and thought “Why?”.

Surrounded by an array of shocked looks, Tomitsuka uneasily averted his eyes. Still, as if making the decision to cross the Rubicon — that might be an exaggeration, he wore the determined look of someone about to take a bungee jump as he endured Tatsuya’s gaze.

“I want Shippou to witness your power!”

Tomitsuka watched Tatsuya with burning eyes. In his mind, he must have envisioned Tatsuya resonating with his manly display and nodding in affirmation. However, this only deepened Tatsuya’s befuddlement.

“I’m not sure I understand what you are talking about?”

The moment he told him so, Tomitsuka became slightly harried in a rather fascinating manner.

“That, well, was kind of out of the blue. In other words……”

“Would it be possible for Shippou to see a match between people of outstanding caliber?”

The one who took over the explanations from the panicking Tomitsuka was Hattori. —Still, just these words alone were insufficient to dispel Tatsuya’s mystification.

“In order to show him a match between people of sufficient caliber, wouldn’t a match between Chairman Hattori and Sawaki-senpai be more appropriate?”

“Shiba, this only becomes meaningful if he sees how powerful you are.”

Hattori’s explanation remained incomplete to the end.

“Onii-sama, isn’t this a wonderful idea?”

Nevertheless, the strongest supporting fire for their cause came to aid Tomitsuka and Hattori at this moment.

“I believe that providing a frame of reference for underclassmen is also one of the duties for Student Council members.”

For some reason, all the upperclassmen and her peers (excluding Tatsuya) who were present mentally translated “Student Council members” into “Onii-sama”.

“I also feel that it’s about time to display Onii-sama’s abilities.”

Miyuki’s motive was both blatant and not entirely in accordance with Tomitsuka and Hattori. There was significant frustration and anxiety lurking behind her smile, to the point that Tatsuya felt that “leaving it alone would be a bad idea”.

“……Since you put it that way, very well.”

Tatsuya changed his mind, or more like decided, and this should be exactly what Tomitsuka had desired. In spite of this clear turnout, for some reason, Tomitsuka’s mood couldn’t help but soar.

This feeling was not restricted to him alone.



Hattori had extended the appointment in this room precisely for this reason from the very beginning. All of the Year 3 students present knew about this plan. With the permission slip already obtained, they could begin at any time after clearing the practice floor.

“Please leave it to me.”

Miyuki volunteered to clean up the paper scraps scattered all over the floor. After manipulating her CAD, there was hardly an instant’s delay before air currents gradually began to move. The currents covered the entire floor in a complicated swirl and gathered all the trash into a pile in a few quick moments. Using the vacuum cleaner provided for the room, Miyuki disposed of the paper scraps.

Seeing her naturally perform a complicated and pristine magic with surgical skill, the Year 3 students watched her with impressed looks, Mikihiko and Tomitsuka let out amazed breaths, whereas Takuma once again suffered a blow. —Excluding the process used to harden the paper scraps, the magic Miyuki just wielded far surpassed the technical difficulty for Takuma’s Million Edge.

“Shiba-kun, do you think this is sufficient?”

“Ah, it’s fine.”

Tatsuya passed his coat to Miyuki before taking the field in his uniform.

“Would it be better if I removed my shoes?”

“No, you’re fine as you are.”

That sentence implied that Tatsuya would be fine even if struck by kicks from thick-soled shoes.

Following that, Tatsuya and Tomitsuka faced one another at the center of the field.

Hattori remained the referee. However, he skipped the explanation this time.

“Are you two ready? Then, begin!”



The instant Hattori gave the signal, both Tatsuya and Tomitsuka stepped off from the floor.

Differing from the earlier exchange, Tomitsuka aggressively charged towards Tatsuya’s position.

Yet, Tatsuya’s retreat was even faster. One leap took him to the other end of the practice room as Tatsuya pointed his pistol-shaped CAD at Tomitsuka.

The magic Tatsuya equipped was Decomposition Magic, Mist Dispersal.

Heedless of Miyuki’s shock, Tatsuya pulled the CAD’s trigger.

—And nothing happened.

(As I thought.)

Completely opposite from the pale faced Miyuki covering the corner of her mouth with one hand, Tatsuya wore an expression that signified that this was within his expectations as he jumped to the side in order to avoid Tomitsuka’s punch that had been enhanced by personal acceleration magic.

This was not him putting on a brave front, as he had already predicted that Mist Dispersal would be nullified.

In Tatsuya’s vision, Tomitsuka’s projection was covered by a thick cloud, turning it into a fuzzy outline. That was how he beheld Tomitsuka’s figure through the Idea.

The dense cloud surrounding Tomitsuka’s body was the psion armor that covered his personal information.

Gram Demolition was a Counter Magic that relied on psion pressure to strip the Magic Sequence from the target.

However, Tomitsuka wasn’t using the psions like a cannonball to blow away the Magic Sequence. The thick layer of psion armor surrounding his “body” denied any invasion from Magic Sequences.

If Gram Demolition was artillery, then Tomitsuka’s Contact-Type Gram Demolition was a wall of steel. Furthermore, that wall was not built from information and was only a massive amount of psions haphazardly wrapped around him. Even for Tatsuya, breaking through this line of defense to directly affect Tomitsuka with magic was no easy task.

In that regard, using the phenomena brought on by magic to attack could not be stopped by psion armor.

Yet, so long as Tatsuya still held onto the handicap of not utilizing attacks through the Idea, then he was a deficient Magician who could not use magic that directly influenced physical phenomena.



After his charge had been evaded for the 5th time, agitation began building in Tomitsuka’s heart.

He who was known as Range Zero had no long range magic abilities. On the other hand, he was confident that he was twice as capable as the average person when it came to close-quarters magic.

Nevertheless, his attacks had been easily dodged.

He was not being avoided through magic, but by a combination of magical and physical techniques.

(Although I had my own suspicions, to think that he’s capable to this degree……)

In all honesty, his awe was growing thanks to the caliber of his opponent. Yet, at the same time, his morale surged.

(But I’m not going to lose. I definitely can’t lose at this range!)

Shippou vanished from Tomitsuka’s consciousness. The purpose behind this match as well as the role he was supposed to play also faded within his mind. His entire will had been submersed in the drive for victory.



“They’re both pretty damn good! I knew about Tomitsuka’s skills a long time ago, but I never imagined Shiba-kun was just as capable.”

“I’m actually more surprised that Tomitsuka can keep up with the elder Shiba in a fight.”

Hearing the conversation between his seniors, Mikihiko could only feel astonishment. His opinion mirrored Kirihara’s own. He never thought that one of his peers would be a match for Tatsuya in a fight. Mikihiko felt like this was the first time he had ever seen Tatsuya being pressed in battle.

Tatsuya had long since been able to just avoid Tomitsuka’s attacks. Now, he had been forced to the point where he had to counterattack. Tatsuya holding the CAD in his right hand was a clear sign that Tatsuya surrendered that point. According to the rules of the match, using the CAD to strike an opponent was forbidden. Even excluding that detail, Tomitsuka’s furious attack was pressing home on Tatsuya.

Suddenly feeling a little concerned, Mikihiko directed his gaze to one side.

There, Miyuki wore a completely invested expression as she concentrated all of her attention on her brother.



Sitting against the wall, Takuma was blown away by the battle unfolding before his eyes.

From a cursory examination, this was nothing more than a plain brawl. No, thanks to the occasional kick, this appeared to be a mixed martial arts match. However, high level magic was behind every single blow. It was only because he had the talent to recognize this that the mental shock was amplified.

Tomitsuka closed the distance at a speed that the naked eye was unable to follow. Although he was using personal acceleration magic to raise the physical body’s speed, this was nothing so coarse as “as fast as possible”. Within the realm of conscious control, he held his speed at the upper limit of where his consciousness was able to follow.

Regardless, here Tomitsuka’s pace grew ragged. The instant he stepped off to move forward, there was the misconception that the ground he stepped off from seemed to vibrate. Of course, this vibration was created by Tatsuya’s magic. In spite of this, even if vibration waves appeared where Tomitsuka was standing, they were often nullified by (what appeared to be) occasional activation of Gram Demolition. Takuma had personally encountered this first hand. Nonetheless, the aftershocks that accompanied these vibrations were pure physical phenomena and could not be dispelled by Gram Demolition. If this was on muddy terrain or concrete, the aftershocks would probably not be strong enough to be detected. However, the floor in this practice room was designed with the appropriate hardness and flexibility to cushion falling without disrupting movement. Taking this into account, Tatsuya used magic to interfere from this angle.

His body had already taken everything into consideration until this disruption presented itself, so Tomitsuka paused briefly to maximize the fluidity of his body’s motions. Using this brief opening, Tatsuya aimed the CAD at Tomitsuka and pulled the trigger. At the same time, Oscillation-Type Magic rushed towards Tomitsuka at such speed that Takuma didn’t even have time to comprehend the deployment of the Activation Sequence. Based on the wavering psions, this magic contained both Oscillation-Type and Nonsystematic magic.

This magic did not possess the power to strike down Tomitsuka. Takuma hypothesized that this magic probably placed more emphasis on speed than strength. Takuma supposed that he was unable to recognize the Activation Sequence because it had been tuned this way or this was the CAD’s effect.

That being said, not possessing the strength to strike down Tomitsuka was not the same as having no effect. After being struck by the psion wave, the psion field around Tomitsuka’s body also shook slightly. Turning into noise and smoke, the psion wave briefly dulled Tomitsuka’s senses.

The next blow was the real attack. Using his left palm, Tatsuya threw a palm strike at Tomitsuka. Takuma detected that some sort of magic was being held in his left hand.

Once again, Tatsuya displayed a different attack. This time, Tomitsuka adopted a defensive stance. Using the right arm wrapped in Contact-Type Gram Demolition, he blocked Tatsuya’s left palm holding Oscillation-Type Magic. In the face of a myriad different attacks, Tomitsuka only used one shield to continuously defend himself.

At this point, Tomitsuka’s left hand jabbed towards Tatsuya’s abdomen. Dodging was made difficult because his earlier attack had been blocked, and Tatsuya barely managed to slide across the blocking right arm.

Tomitsuka activated Acceleration Magic “Explosion”. In the middle of casting this magic, Tatsuya used Gram Demolition to destroy the magic that was being activated.

In order to avoid the follow up attack, Tatsuya jumped far to the side. Takuma momentarily forgot to breathe as he watched this. He was unable to believe the sight unfolding in front of him and was terrified that his feelings as a Magician were faltering.

Tomitsuka’s Acceleration Magic had been nullified during the cast. Using the interrupted phenomenon as a stepping point, Tatsuya activated his own Acceleration Magic.

(Is that sort of thing even possible!?)

Takuma wanted to shout out loud. If his internal shock was any lighter, he undoubtedly would have called out. It was true that for the same type of phenomenon alteration, the latter magic could be cast without suffering interference from the phenomenon alteration strength of the former. Since Explosion was an acceleration vector that expanded outward from the point of activation in a semi-spherical manner, accelerating to the side did not violate this principle.

However, that was merely not violating the principle. Takuma had never even considered the possibility of using another person’s magic to create new phenomenon alteration by moving in accordance to the physical rule of least resistance.

What was being displayed before his eyes was indeed the same “magic” he himself was using. They were techniques that belonged to the same category. Yet, his own magic was far beneath the level of the magic before him. Takuma had been completely defeated by the otherworldly duel erupting before his eyes.



(My attacks aren’t landing!)

Tomitsuka was gradually growing more agitated.

The battle had not gone on for very long. Barely 10 minutes had elapsed since the beginning of the match. Yet, unlike his physical sensations, Tomitsuka’s mental fatigue felt like he had been in combat for dozens of hours.

The current situation favored him. Without a doubt, his side held the advantage. Tomitsuka had complete confidence in that assessment. Although he had yet to land the decisive blow, Tomitsuka could feel that his attacks were beginning to tell even though they fell upon his opponent’s defenses. Tomitsuka sensed that from contact.

However, Tatsuya was not the only one sustaining damage. Tomitsuka himself could detect the accumulated wear and tear building on him. While he had successfully blocked his opponent’s attacks, the damage he incurred came from misconceptions and not his physical body. Yet, it was precisely these misconceptions that were steadily causing his shield to crumble. Each of the varied attacks sent his way were uniform in the sense that they all contained Nonsystematic Oscillation-Type Magic. The oscillation would rebound off the shield and dissipate, but in that instant, the vibration would carry over to the shield itself. That vibration would shake the psions, causing the psion field to expand as if heated, alerting Tomitsuka that the density dropped during those moments.

Tomitsuka himself was unable to fire psions at distant targets and could only maintain a field tightly surrounding his own body. This deficiency was precisely the reason why he was unable to use long distance magic. The magic scholar summoned by his parents explained that this phenomenon showed that his “core” heavily attracted psions, hereby restricting psions that normally flowed out of the body from doing so. On some level, the Contact-Type Gram Demolition that Miyuki and Sawaki spoke of was the byproduct of his cursed physical disposition.

Tomitsuka had long since come to terms with his condition. After expending considerable effort to become somewhat able to use long range magic, he had turned this unique condition of his into a close combat weapon that could not be found on any other Magician. When facing purely physical attacks coming at him like the shockwave emitted by Sawaki’s accelerated fists – the fact that the president of the Magic Martial Arts club bestowed upon it the embarrassing title of “Mach Fist” remained a secret only known to club members – this only offered a “slightly higher” level of defense, but in regards to coming into direct contact with magic, Tomitsuka had absolute confidence in himself.

In spite of this, the psion field that should only be able to contract was gradually expanding under Tatsuya’s attacks.

This detail struck Tomitsuka in a manner that was beyond expression. This was not simple fear or cowardice, but the shock that came upon someone who peeked into Pandora’s Box.

The psion field that could not spread out was expanding. Wasn’t this that long cherished, but impossible dream?

Tomitsuka hurriedly stilled his leaping heart.

The one standing against him was not an opponent he could defeat while worrying about frivolous matters.

In order to settle this, he decided to use his trump card.



Tomitsuka’s entire body was covered in psions. Beyond Tatsuya, everyone here to watch the match could feel them.

Tomitsuka’s body accelerated at an explosive rate. —The only two who realized that this was not caused by personal Acceleration Magic were Tatsuya and Sawaki.

The psions that wrapped around Tomitsuka’s body like a formless cloud suddenly grew organized. They were driven into place by Tomitsuka’s will.

Far more precise than before, Tomitsuka delivered a mid-kick.

The Magic Sequence for “Heating” covered his leg. If struck by that kick, the damage would be equitable to being bathed in microwave electromagnetism. Using his elbow as the focal point for Gram Demolition, Tatsuya planned on blocking the kick fueled by Heating Magic.

Yet, Tomitsuka’s right leg came to an unnatural stop an instant before coming into contact with Tatsuya’s left elbow.
