	 The sudden words made Miyuki involuntarily straighten up even more, although she was already sitting upright.

	"If we're not talking about the effect, but about how the Tsukuba family's "Pledge" is arranged, then this is a spell that forces someone to use the magic that the spell user wants. Forcing them to use magic to control someone's mind. You can call it magic, interfering in the processes of other magic. Thus, it is ineffective for use by those who are not magicians."

	 Miyuki nodded her understanding.

	Because of its nature of interference in the processes of magic, "Pledge" is established in the deep layers of consciousness, next to the "Gates". We can say that this system is close in that sense to "Gatekeeper."

	 "To the "Gatekeeper", developed by Onii-sama?"

	"Right. "Pledge" is a spell that makes use of magic, and "Gatekeeper" is a spell that prohibits using magic. Naturally, their systems are similar."

	 Miyuki nodded once more.

	"Therefore "Pledge" can be eliminated using "Gatekeeper."

	 Tatsuya took the cup from the stand and handed it to Miyuki. Embarrassed, Miyuki took it. With his free hand, Tatsuya removed the lid from the jug, took it and turned to Miyuki.

	 "Is this ...?"

	 "Don't worry, it's not alcohol."

	 Miyuki was embarrassed not because she thought he offered her alcohol.

	 The thing is, she thought that this is the ceremony of "San-san-kudo" *.

	*San-san-kudo (3-3-9) is a ceremony that is conducted at the time of marriage. The newlyweds alternately make 3 sips from 3 cups with sake.*

	 Although three cups of different sizes should be prepared for San-ku-kudo, but the atmosphere here was suitable.

	 Miyuki timidly set the cup and Tatsuya poured a clear liquid.

	 Miyuki put the cup to her face. There was no smell.

	 She gathered all her resolve and drained the whole cup in one gulp ... After which her face finally relaxed. Because the liquid didn't have any taste either.

	"Onii-sama ... what is this?"

	This water is highly purified. Although it is impossible to achieve a level of ultrapurity(?) due to contact with the container and air, but this is the closest to that level of purity, excluding all other pollution factors.

	 Tatsuya passed the jug to Miyuki, and she poured water into Tatsuya's cup.

	 "Um ... Is that a farewell bowl of water?"

	 "Farewell bowls of water" meant the ritual of parting. Miyuki's voice trembled a little. Not only her voice, but both hands holding the jug trembled as well.

	"No, it's different. Unless in case the use of clean water will not be an excessive difficulty?" Answered Tatsuya, having drunk clean water from the cup.

	"Yes, really ..."

	 Miyuki stopped trembling. Tatsuya returned the cup to the stand. After that, Miyuki first put the jug on the stand, and then the cup.

	 "It was a ritual to cleanse the body. Of course it's only symbolic. By accepting a pure substance, we increase the purity of the body and mind. If you look for the necessary pure substance, suitable for eating or drinking, and while not harmful to the body, then water is the best candidate."

	 Tatsuya pushed the stand aside. Now there were no obstacles between Tatsuya and Miyuki.

	"To interfere with "Pledge" located in the deepest layer of consciousness, we also need to get in touch on the deepest level."

	"Onii-sama ...?"

	 What is this, a joke? She wanted to ask, but ...

	"What?"

	"...!"

	 She saw Tatsuya looking at her with an absolutely serious look, and her mind completely emptied, and her face turned red.



	"Er, this is my ... first time ... and if possible, it's better on the futon ..."





	Turning and trembling all over, Miyuki tried to complain with a thin voice.

	 Tatsuya's face petrified. Expression of the face showed absolute surprise.

	 "... I'm sorry!" Tatsuya suddenly bowed low.

	 "... Um, Onii-sama?" Miyuki asked after she timidly turned her head back and saw Tatsuya.

	"Please forgive me for misleading you with an ambiguous phrase."

	 Tatsuya raised his head and met his eyes with Miyuki. There was shame in his eyes, which was very rare.

	"Speaking about the deep level of contact, it was meant in the spiritual sense ... In this case physical contact will disturb the mind and will interfere."

	 It took a second in order for Tatsuya's words to leak into Miyuki's mind. After that second, Miyuki tried to run away while covering her face with her hands. Tatsuya quickly reached out and grabbed Miyuki's shoulder.

	 "Let go, please! Onii-sama, I beg you!"

	 "It's my fault! So calm down!"

	 If he let her go now, then this problem will drag on for a long time ... Tatsuya had that feeling, and he desperately tried to reassure Miyuki.





	 Miyuki managed to regain peace after only 10 minutes of Tatsuya's persuasion.

	 "...I apologize. For this unsightly behavior ..."

	 "... No, I must apologize."

	 Tatsuya and Miyuki met with a glance. At first both were embarrassed, but in the end, their faces became serious.

	 "Let's start, Onii-sama." Miyuki was the first to speak.

	"Ok, we will."

	 Tatsuya moved closer to Miyuki. When the distance became such that their knees touched each other, their eyes met again.

	I will now explain the spell.

	"Yes."

	"After releasing the seal, Miyuki will cease to supply "Pledge" with magical power."

	"Yes."

	"The "Pledge" spell will increase its activity, achieving the purpose of the Pledge. At this time, the true form of magic hiding in the deep layers of consciousness will become visible."

	"Yes."

	"Then I attack it with my "Gatekeeper". Though it's in a state mixed with consciousness and because I'm not able to use Mental Interference magic, I cannot get it. However, if the magic sequence appears then I can "decompose" it."

	"Yes. I rely on you, Onii-sama." Miyuki said while nodding. Staring Tatsuya directly in the eyes, she rose a little. Putting her hands on his shoulders to keep her balance, she put her lips to his forehead.

	 A flood of psion light erupted. In a raging psion vortex, the power came out of Miyuki's hands.

	 Tatsuya hugged Miyuki tightly. The warmth and softness of Miyuki's body, separated only by a thin white cloth, were transmitted to Tatsuya. But he wasn't even excited feeling it.

	 Hugging Miyuki, who was breathing heavily, Tatsuya sent his "Eye" into her.

	 He concentrated his mind.

	 Reason is the area that its "Eye" cannot reach. Suffering from excessive concentration that almost deteriorates the mind, Tatsuya directed his "Elemental Sight" at something that he should not be able to "see."

	 You cannot "see" the mind. But you can "see" the psion information body. Tatsuya was looking for hidden magic in Miyuki that didn't belong to her, and finally found it. His Elemental Sight aimed at the growing strength of the magic sequence of "Pledge."

	 Tatsuya activated gatekeeper.

	 This is the "Scattering spell" that targets the "Gate" (this is a kind of "exit" from the subconscious area from which magic sequences are released) of the magician. "Gram Dispersion" decomposes the psion information body, so that it can be called magic, which is a natural enemy of magic.

	 Even if magic affects the mind, its true form isn't an information body built of cells, but a psion information body. Therefore, it will not be able to avoid " Gram Dispersion."

	 Having manifested to begin fulfilling Pledge, the sequence of the magic of the "Pledge" showed its true form and was destroyed by Tatsuya's magic.

	Tatsuya got his freedom.





	CHAPTER 9





	Sunday, morning.

	 As promised Katsuto came by private car to pick up Mayumi from the Saegusa mansion.

	 Katsuto had an impressive car. Size, power, reliability, everything was present.

	 Mayumi stared dazedly at this car, which looked as if it had been in the armed conflicts zone of Central Asia.

	"Juumonji-kun. Did the Self-Defense Forces sell this to you?"

	This is a normal commercial vehicle.

	 This SUV really wasn't made to order, nor was it a converted car. It was a special limited edition model modification of an original model, but it was a purely commercial model car. Even if its design was copied from military vehicles.

	 But Katsuto, subjected to unfair accusations, also had something to ask Mayumi about.

	 "More importantly Saegusa, why haven't I heard from you that Watanabe was going too."

	 The look coming from Katsuto, who asked almost the exact same question as last month, was slightly more intense than usual.

	 Mari, standing next to Mayumi, nodded with a face saying "say something else."

	 Mayumi pulled a feigned smile, as if saying "what, for example!".

	"So what? Mari also worries about our kohai."

	"Hey! Don't say it as if I signed on at will!" Complained Mari, who was taken by surprise at such a shift of responsibility. However, even these words of protest couldn't hide the obvious lie.

	 "You are yourself Mari, don't be shy about it."

	 "Well, you ..."

	 Mari couldn't find the words to answer the pretending friendly Mayumi.

	 "Instead of arguing, let's go! We will not waste time." Taking advantage of the pause, Mayumi offered to continue what they were here for.

	 "That's right ..."

	 "Nothing is planned for today, but it certainly will be a waste of time if you quarrel here", thought Katsuto and returned to the driver's seat.

	 With a satisfied face, Mayumi climbed onto the rear passenger seat. Mari followed Mayumi with a resigned face.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 Mayumi who had set off to Izu in such a triumphant mood, quickly came down to earth and was on the way to becoming depressed.

	"I refuse." This was Tatsuya's answer.

	 These words were addressed to Katsuto sitting opposite Tatsuya in the villa.

	 Next to Tatsuya was Miyuki. Her expressionless face turned aside to Mayumi who sat next to Katsuto. Under the pressure of Miyuki's gaze, Mayumi was unable to maintain even the usual polite smile.

	"Why?"

	 Terrible voice Katsuto Tatsuya, but Mayumi involuntarily almost jumped from the sofa.

	 Neither Tatsuya nor Miyuki showed any reaction to such a powerful voice.

	 "I must ask this. Why do you think that I should participate in "Project Dion" Juumonji-senpai?"

	 Tatsuya refused Katsuto's request to participate in the American "Project Dion."

	 "Shiba, two years ago I told you that you must join the Ten Master Clans."

	 "Yes, I remember."

	 "The Ten Master Clans is part of the system of mutual aid for the magicians of this country created by Elder Kudo."

	"I think this isn't part of the system, but its management link, but ... I understand it too."

	 "I believe that those who have great power, those who have exceptional abilities, also bear the responsibility."

	 Tatsuya silently waited for him to continue.

	 "Most magicians don't have much power. If you limit yourself to brute force, most magicians cannot compete with ordinary people who don't know magic, but have studied martial arts."

	 "So it seems because of different methods of evaluation. In addition, those magicians who don't serve in the army or the police are considered ordinary civilians."

	 "What a sophistry ..." Mari mumbled in an irritated voice, sitting on the side opposite to Mayumi of Katsuto.

	 However, Tatsuya ignored this statement and Katsuto didn't care either.

	 "Nnon-magicians think that magicians are a different race, and this isn't limited to our country alone. This can be seen by looking at what is happening around the world."

	"But not everyone thinks so. Let's skip that part for now."

	Tatsuya's gaze called out for him to continue.

	"I completely disagree with the idea that magicians are a different race from people. Don't forget the fact that magicians are a minority. Magicians should be friends and help each other. In this sense, I believe that the Ten Master Clans system created by the elder is correct.

	"If this mutual assistance by magicians doesn't lead to contempt and exclusion of people who cannot use magic, then I also think that it is correct."

	"... Do you mean that magicians look down on those incapable of magic, like some elite class looks at commoners?" Mari asked sitting next to Katsuto. The question clearly read the subtext "you think too much."

	"In the near future it could become true." This time Tatsuya didn't ignore Mari.

	"Shiba. Entering the Ten Master Clans, you should also give a helping hand to those same magicians." Katsuto ignored both Mari's question and Tatsuya's answer.

	"Dear head of the Juumonji family. Sorry for being rude, but Tatsuya-sama is a direct descendant of the head of the Yotsuba family." Miyuki said. After talking with Tatsuya last night, Miyuki finally admitted that for the rest of the world "Tatsuya-sama" is her fiancé.

	 "I know successor-donor of the Yotsuba family. But I think that the Ten Master Clans is a duty, not a pedigree."

	 Katsuto returned his gaze to Tatsuya.

	 "Magicians who have great power, should help the weak magicians. Public opinion of magicians has been declining every day pushing magicians into a corner. Everything comes to the fact that they will slander us and say that wars only occur because magicians exist."

	 Katsuto interrupted his speech and looked at Tatsuya's reaction. Seeing that Tatsuya didn't change his expression at all, he continued.

	 "I'm not going to blame you for that Tactical Class magic. That would be an obvious mistake."

	 "Tactical Class Magic" was referring to the use of the "Active Air Mine" by a rebel girl in Central Asia. Although this incident led to the cancellation of the Nine Schools Competition which caused a wide-spread public reaction among magic high schools students, but Tatsuya didn't feel a drop of guilt from the very beginning, so now he didn't brow. Katsuto continued to talk while feeling that he had miscalculated a little.

	"However if you take part in "Project Dion" then we can show everyone that magic isn't just for war. After the New Soviet Union's declaration of participation in the project, Japan can be considered as lagging behind in the peaceful use of magic. We can no longer turn a blind eye to the spread of slander against magicians in our country. Effective measures are needed."

	 "I can understand your concerns Juumonji-sama, but why Tatsuya-sama? There are professors at the National Magic University who are world-renowned authorities."

	 Katsuto hesitated to answer Miyuki's question. He understood that this was a fair argument. You cannot force one high school student to solve national problems. And yet he tried to give an answer, feeling his debt as the head of the Juumonji family of the Ten Master Clans.

	 "That's because, Miyuki-san ..."

	 But then Mayumi spoke, ahead of Katsuto.

	 Katsuto should no longer carry this burden alone. I will take it upon myself to become Miyuki's opponent. This was the course of her thoughts.

	 "... Edward Clark said that Tatsuya-kun is Taurus Silver."

	 "What!?" Mari showed a powerful reaction to Mayumi's words.

	 Miyuki only frowned slightly. Tatsuya's face didn't have any noticeable movement.

	 "Even if it's supposedly ..." Miyuki quietly retorted.... "Tatsuya-sama and is Taurus Silver, then what of it?"

	 "Er ...?" Mayumi looked at Miyuki with an uncomprehending face after saying something completely unexpected.

	 "Even if Tatsuya-sama is Taurus Silver, this does not change the fact that he's a minor high school student."

	 Silencing Mayumi with these words, she continued on:

	 "Besides, the Yotsuba family isn't going to admit that Tatsuya-sama is Taurus Silver."

	 It was a hint that if they decided that Taurus Silver's real identity is Tatsuya, then they should be prepared for a total confrontation with the Yotsuba family.

	 Miyuki was prepared to simultaneously fight the Saegusa and Juumonji families. But Mayumi wasn't ready to provoke a comprehensive conflict between the Saegusa and Yotsuba families. That was the difference between them at that moment.

	"Shiba." Katsuto's voice interrupted the silence. "Do you still stubbornly refuse to take part in the project?"

	"I do. This project has ulterior motives."

	"And this is a good reason why the magicians of this country will be in a difficult situation?"

	 "I don't mind if you think that way."

	 From the confrontations of Tatsuya and Katsuto sparks sprang.

	"I understand. ... If you don't want it that way, then it's inevitable."

	 Katsuto stood up.

	"Shiba, let's go outside."

	 Tatsuya stood up, looking Katsuto in the eye.

	"Juumonji Katsuto, are you serious?"

	 Whether from Mayumi, or from Mari, a cry was heard.

	 The air around him began to get colder. The reason for this wasn't Miyuki. It was the coldness of steel emitted by Tatsuya.

	 "The situation cannot wait. Your refusal isn't accepted."

	 Whether from Miyuki, or Minami heard a restrained groan.

	 Katsuto's body exerted pressure, as if exceeding the gravity of the Earth several times.

	"Fine."

	 Tatsuya completely discarded the politeness of kohai towards the sempai.

	"Pixie, my CAD."



	"Yes, Master."

	 On Tatsuya's order, Pixie went to the case with the CAD.

	"I'll go on ahead."

	 Katsuto turned his back on Tatsuya and left. He had absolutely no fear of being attacked from behind. Minami hastily ran to open the front door.

	"Saegusa-sempai, Watanabe-sempai."

	 Tatsuya softened his voice a little. Thus, these two woke up from their stunned state.

	"You also need to prepare. Please, go on ahead."

	 "Do you mind if we help Juumonji-kun ...?"

	 "It's too late to think about it, isn't?"Tatsuya responded coldly to Mayumi's question.

	 "You're very arrogant. Won't you regret it?"

	 "Regardless of what happens, I will not regret it."

	 On Mari's malicious remark, Tatsuya responded in the same tone as before.

	 "... Mari, let's go." Mayumi stood up and turned to Mari.

	"Alright .... Tatsuya-kun, don't forget about those words." Mari said and followed along with Mayumi.





	 The three led by Katsuto stood near the SUV and waited for Tatsuya.

	 Tatsuya left the villa with Miyuki and Minami. He headed towards Katsuto, but didn't stop as he passed by.

	"Follow me. We can damage the villa from here." Tatsuya said, passing Katsuto.

	 When Miyuki and Minami passed by, Katsuto followed them with a small interval. Mayumi and Mari also excitedly went after Katsuto.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 In the shadows of the trees, someone was hiding and watching the developing events between Tatsuya and Katsuto. This man waited until Mari, who was last, went far enough, then brought his wrist with a wristwatch to his mouth.

	 The rat said "Shiba Tatsuya left the villa. Currently heading to a private golf course."

	 There was a built-in microphone in the strap of the wristwatches communication device.

	The Boar said "Understood. Stop observation and reunite with the main unit. From the built-in dummy glasses of the speaker of the communication device, the answer of his accomplice was heard.

	"Can't I check the destination?"

	 Monkey is observing the area of thea closed golf course, and if they turn at a fork then Bird is waiting in the other direction.

	The rat said "Understood."

	 The person using the code name Rat was a secret agent of the special affairs unit of the National Self-Defense Forces Intelligence Unit.

	 The detachment planning to attack Tatsuya today consisted mainly of the counterintelligence unit to which Tooyama Tsukasa belonged. However to ensure they didn't lose sight of Tatsuya in the mountains, observers from the special affairs unit were also involved.

	 The other day, Rat made a mistake when the data from the photo of the girl who visited Tatsuya was damaged. On that issue, it was concluded that this was a camera hardware failure, and no one accused the Rat himself.

	 But to the Rat living in the world of shadow operations for more than 10 years, it was very worrying.

	 Although he was able to recover from the memory a portrait of the girl visiting Shiba Tatsuya, but it wasn't suitable for performing facial recognition to reveal their disguise. In fact, they haven't yet been able to establish the identity of this beautiful girl, from whom a strange sense of unfriendliness emanated.

	 For the Rat, today's mission was a struggle to regain his honor. He really wanted to continue monitoring until the destination was determined.

	 However, an order was given, and he had no choice. As he was ordered, he left the place to join the main squad.

	 Because his head was in the clouds, he didn't notice that someone was watching him.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	On the Izu Peninsula there were many golf courses that were confiscated during the last World War for use as air defense positions. They would be returned to the original owners after the war ended. But among them there were also golf courses, the management companies of which refused to receive them back, comparing the costs of restoration and possible income.

	 After the statutory compensation payment, such golf courses became state land, but they remained untouched after the anti-aircraft guns were removed from their positions.

	 Tatsuya brought Katsuto to one of these closed golf courses.

	Here they won't need to be distracted by concerns that the buildings will be damaged.

	 Tatsuya stopped, turned around and said to Katsuto.

	 "Is it alright that we're in such an open place?"

	 The point of Katsuto's question was that he considered provocation as an invitation to become an enemy in an open area.

	"Juumonji-dono wants excuses?"

	 Tatsuya's response was a standard phrase, but it seems to have worked.

	"...Good. Shiba, I leave the first move for you."

	 Simultaneously with those words, Katsuto's barrier magic was deployed and the battle between them began. Katsuto's words were also another provocation: "Try and break my defenses if you can."

	 Unlike him Tatsuya didn't show any desire to continue fighting with words alone. In this situation, it is better to express your thoughts with magic.

	 In Tatsuya's right hand appeared a CAD in the form of a pistol. A moment later, the customized Silver Horn "Trident" was already fired at Katsuto.

	 Around Katsuto a lot of violent outbursts arose.

	 It was a light invisible to the unaided eye. However everyone present was an excellent magician. There were no people who couldn't see these bursts of psion light.

	 There were 18 flashes from Tatsuya attacks, and none of these attacks reached Katsuto's body.

	"Zone Interference", "Data Fortification" and "Psion wall"?

	"It's commendable that you saw this, but I cannot be defeated with one glance."

	 Tatsuya's words were only for distraction, but this plan was easily revealed. Tatsuya again activated decomposition magic.

	 Psion Wall as the name suggests is a magic that surrounds the user's body with a wall of high density psions. Although this magic looks similar to the barrier version of contact gram demolition, but unlike Tomitsuki's innate defense, this structure is created by artificial compression of psions. Therefore, it can be decomposed by Tatsuya's magic.

	 However, immediately after decomposing the Psion wall, a dome of powerful Zone Interference magic appears in the way. If you expand the Zone Interference Magic, then the shield comes up from the Data Fortification.

	 Even if you break it, then a new Psion Wall is coming. Zone Interference magic. Further it was expected Data Fortification, but again there was Zone Interference magic. A Psion Wall. Data Fortification. Zone Interference. Data Fortification. A Psion Wall. A Psion Wall. Zone Interference. Data Fortification...



	 Thus, three different anti-magic protections were created one after another.

	 Since they weren't created at the same time, you couldn't erase them in one go.

	 Due to the lack of a pattern it was impossible to prepare the necessary sequence of several decomposition magics in advance.

	If several barriers of the same kind are created simultaneously, then Tatsuya can process them as one magic sequence. In other words, he can decompose them at the same time. This isn't limited to magic sequences and psion information bodies. If there are objects with a simple structure and the same properties, then it can recognize them as a single "set" and perform the decomposition of one "set" rather than each object separately.

	 However, Katsuto's barriers were created one by one, using the destruction of the already deployed barrier as a signal to create the next barrier. But Tatsuya cannot decompose what does not exist yet.

	 When you find out what will be created, you can destroy the structure that creates this.

	 But every time this structure, which serves as a "factory," is destroyed, it is reproduced again. If this happens at the same speed as Tatsuya, then his decomposition will not be able to overtake it.

	 He already knew that his magic was very poorly compatible with the defensive version of Phalanx. Now Tatsuya realized this as a fact.

	 The outbreaks of psion light accompanying the destruction of barriers ceased. In order to overcome the situation as quickly as possible, Tatsuya stopped his attacks for an instant.

	 Immediately after this, a two-dimensional wall flew towards Tatsuya.

	 Magic, which is designed to crush the target, continuously striking with impermeable barriers to the substance.

	 The attacking version of Phalanx.

	 And it has already been activated. It already existed. And if it exists, then there is no sequence of magic that Tatsuya cannot decompose.

	 Tatsuya one "shot" erased all 24 layers that make up this magic barrier.

	"Hou ..."

	 Katsuto exclaimed out loud, and he grinned. Although he realized that the Attack Phalanx was completely incompatible with Tatsuya's magic, he showed no concern.

	 Katsuto sat down for a bit. Through his Elemental Sight, Tatsuya saw that Katsuto's Magic Calculation Area was lit by intense psion light.

	 Overclocking of the Magic Calculation Area.

	 Ichijou Gouki the head of the Ichijo family showed signs last month of overheating. Once upon a time, Yotsuba Genzo, the former head of the Yotsuba family also lost his life from overheating.

	 "Attack ...!"

	 Tatsuya got ready. Katsuto's huge body flew.

	 Unfolding the anti-object barrier in a spherical shape in addition to the anti-magic barrier, Katsuto turned into a cannonball and flew forward. Tatsuya extended his left hand forward.

	 From this palm shot a stream of highly compressed psions.

	 Gram Demolition.

	 Having broken the anti-object barrier surrounding Katsuto, and passing through his Zone Interference, the stream of psions demolished the Acceleration magic.

	 However.

	 While Katsuto's body was still in the air, the Acceleration magic and the anti-object barrier were restored. No, they were reactivated.

	 Katsuto was approaching. On the verge of the collision, Tatsuya successfully destroyed the anti-object barrier. ... But he couldn't neutralize the Acceleration magic. Katsuto's shoulder struck Tatsuya's shoulder.

	 "Tatsuya-sama!" This involuntary cry came not from Miyuki, but from Minami.

	 Tatsuya's body was thrown back, and he fell in the overgrown weeds. Miyuki clenched her lips, but looked patiently at Tatsuya.

	 While falling Tatsuya Flash Cast Move-type magic to gain some distance from Katsuto. Katsuto didn't pursue.

	 It wasn't because he had already recognized his victory, but because his goal was to force him to surrender.

	 "Did you even use magic?" Tatsuya muttered, rising.

	 After he was thrown back, Tatsuya noticed that just before the blow, Katsuto used Fortification magic on his jacket shoulder.

	"There is no reason not to use it."

	 Katsuto again released light from the emitted surplus psions.

	 Overclocking the magic calculation area, leading to its overheating. Tatsuya knew that Katsuto was doing it consciously.

	 The trump card of the Juumonji family "Overclocking". *

	 [Here the author writes in English "overclock", and in previous mentions it is written in Japanese, but the literal translation there is "excessive activation."]

	 This is a magical technique that allows you to temporarily surpass your own limits by increasing the activity of the magic calculation area and also temporarily increasing your magical power.

	 This is a magical tactic that allows you to win at the cost of a lifetime as a magician.

	 This was a curse that haunts the "Capital's Final Defense" that isn't allowed to lose.

	 Juumonji Kazuki, the previous head of the Juumonji family, lost his magic ability due to the frequent use of overclocking. And it happened right in front of Katsuto. And yet he used this technique to defeat Tatsuya.

	 Tatsuya decomposed the anti-object barrier flying towards him, and avoided the blow, taking a step to the side. But before Katsuto flew past, his anti-object barrier was redeployed and greatly expanded. Tatsuya was struck again.



	 Katsuto approached Tatsuya lying on the ground. Katsuto's right foot pressed down from above. Under his shoe, an anti-object barrier was deployed duplicating the shape of the sole.

	 Tatsuya escaped this attack at the last moment. However, when he managed to climb to one knee, Tatsuya received a fist from Katsuto. More precisely, it was an attack by the attacking version of Phalanx from a very close distance.

	 Tatsuya wanted to decompose it, but the fist approaching directly behind it was wrapped in an anti-object barrier and Zone Interference. The Zone Interference prevents the activation of magic for all but its user. Tatsuya's hand which had blocked Katsuto's fist bent in an unnatural direction.

	 Tatsuya jumped back to avoid the full force of the punch. By the time his feet touched the ground, traces of a fracture were gone. However, immediately after landing his feet weren't firmly on the ground enough to make the next jump.

	 If he had a few fractions of a second more, he could have dodged this. However, Katsuto didn't give him even that much time.

	 Katsuto's shoulder struck Tatsuya again. Tatsuya's body was thrown back almost 10 meters.

	 You don't fly away, even when you're hit by a car. The force of the impact was probably equivalent to the impact of a heavy truck.

	 Tatsuya was lying on the ground with blood spattered around him. It was obvious to see that he had severe internal injuries.

	 "Tatsuya-kun!" There was a cry from Mayumi, who should be considered an enemy.

	Miyuki clenched her fists and pressed them to her chest, but silently restrained herself while keeping her eyes on Tatsuya.

	 Katsuto extended his right hand toward Tatsuya.

	 "Hey, stop it!"

	 Ignoring Mari's cry, Katsuto released an attacking version of Phalanx in the direction of Tatsuya who was still lying face down. The two-dimensional barrier, capable of crushing an armored car, flew towards Tatsuya. However, just before touching him the 32-layer barrier disappeared.

	"What...?" Katsuto said in astonishment. He didn't think that Tatsuya still had the strength to resist.

	 Tatsuya's hands moved. Pushing away with both hands, he lifted his upper body. And, finally, slowly got up.

	 There were no traces of blood around his mouth and the blood spots had also disappeared within the overgrown weeds.

	"Shiba. This is your "Regrowth"? ..."

	 Katsuto couldn't hide his surprise. However, he quickly regained his composure and deployed the defensive version of Phalanx.

	 Tatsuya didn't say anything. His expression didn't show any emotion. It was completely lacking in humanity.

	 Tatsuya's left hand stretched towards Katsuto. This hand held the CAD in the form of a pistol. But it was slightly different from the one that was in his lowered right hand.

	 At the far end of the CAD on its "muzzle", something similar to a sharp spike was attached. A metal spike 15 cm in length.

	 What is this premonition? Katsuto couldn't decide whether to go on the attack. He tried to jump to the side, but Tatsuya pulled the trigger faster.

	 No one, including Katsuto, could see what happened.

	 But everyone realized that magic was used.





	"Ghuu ..."

	 Katsuto fell to his knees.

	"Juumonji-kun !?"

	"Juumonji !?" Mayumi and Mari shouted.

	 With his right hand, Katsuto squeezed what remained of his left arm. The arm was charred at the elbow, the part below the elbow was torn off and it was lying on the ground.

	"What did you ... do?"

	 He didn't have to answer. Katsuto knew this, but couldn't help but ask.



	 He couldn't help but ask about what could penetrate his barrier.

	"Baryon Lance."

	 However, contrary to Katsuto's expectations, Tatsuya replied.

	 "It's anti-magic magic that decomposes the spearhead into electrons, protons and neutrons, after which the electrons are absorbed by protons and a neutron beam is released."

	 "A neutron beam ...? This is a weapon with radioactive contamination, banned by the International Magic Association!" Katsuto overcome the pain and accused Tatsuya.

	"There is no radiation contamination. No radioactive substance are left. Leaving the fact that the attack was carried out, all the neutrons used for the attack returned to their original position."

	"Regrowth ...?"

	"That's right."

	 Tatsuya again aimed "Baryon Lance" at Katsuto. This time directly at his heart.

	 "Juumonji-dono, give up."

	 "......"

	"Your Phalanx cannot stop my Baryon Lance."

	 Tatsuya explained how the Baryon Lance works to encourage Katsuto to surrender.

	"Juumonji-kun!"

	 Mayumi activated her CAD. But the activation sequence was frozen during the output.

	"This is Miyuki-san !?"

	 Mayumi looked angrily at Miyuki.

	"Counter-magic "Freeze Gram." Saegusa-sempai, you cannot use your CAD." Miyuki said calmly. Her peaceful face radiated a feeling of love and kindness.

	"In that case!"

	 For a modern magician a CAD is an indispensable tool, but this does not mean that it is mandatory for the activation of magic. From the very beginning, modern magic evolved from the supernatural ability to distort reality only by the power of thought. Magicians with great magical power can use magic that they're familiar with even without CAD. This requires only a "spell" of autosuggestion, which stimulates the Magic Calculation Area to create a magic sequence. It takes more time to activate the magic without a CAD.

	Set: decreasing entropy • density control • phase transition • condensation • transformation of the form of energy • acceleration • sublimation: input! Perform a modification of the phenomenon! Magic "Dry meteor"!

	 If you are able to clearly define a concept with words, and introduce this concept into yourself, then you don't need to say it out loud.

	But when you're in front of the enemy, it's too slow to do so. This is equivalent to being under attack all this time. Modern magic discarded casting tools and chose CADs to avoid this.

	 However, Miyuki didn't attack Mayumi while she was casting the spell. Because she didn't need to. Dry meteor wasn't activated.

	"Such a strong Zone Interference... "

	"It's useless. I will not let you interfere with Tatsuya-sama." Miyuki announced

	 Mari ran in silence. In her hand was a battle knife drawn from somewhere. She decided that since magic won't work then she needs to neutralize Miyuki with physical weapons.

	 The idea was correct. If Miyuki was alone. If Minami corresponded to her appearance as an innocent girl.

	 Minami stood beside Mari in the way. A gun barrel was pointed at Mari.

	"Watanabe-sama. Please drop your weapon."

	 Even in this situation, Minami was polite. Mari clenched her teeth.

	 Pistols pose a threat to magicians, and even more so in the current situation when it's impossible to use magic because of Miyuki's Zone Interference. The way Minami held the gun in her hand obviously said that she was used to it, and there were no gaps in her defense.

	 Mari didn't say that it wasn't fair or cowardly. She herself only had a knife, and this girl hid the gun. She understood her naivety. Mari's own pride didn't allow her to turn away from there.

	 "Juumonji! No matter how impressive it was, in the end it's a neutron ray! You can defend yourself with your neutron barrier!"

	 Instead, she shouted a "don't give up" speech at Katsuto.

	 But Katsuto continued to remain motionless on his knees.

	"Unfortunately, the neutron barrier will not protect against Baryon Lance."

	"What!?" Mari was surprised.

	"He's bluffing, Juumonji-kun! The neutron barrier is a suitable magic. You can completely stop the neutron beam" Mayumi cried.

	 To this argument, Tatsuya returned a mysterious answer: "That's why." No, it can be more precisely expressed by these words: "His answer was a mystery for Mayumi and Mari." Because Katsuto already understood the meaning of his words.

	 The neutron beam has a very high penetrating power. Since the properties of the substance are reflected in the "information", information is also embedded in the neutrons Eidos that its penetration power is high.

	 Magic is a technology that interferes with a phenomenon through information. It is difficult to block a neutron beam with magic, which is informationally designated as "having a high penetrating power". With it there is a definition of "difficult to block."

	 At the dawn of its appearance, modern magic was primarily aimed at preventing disasters caused by nuclear fission reactions. Blocking neutron beams was also an inevitable theme in modern magic. A lot of research resources have been poured into the search for ways to block neutron beams using magic.

	 The result of these studies was the Neutron barrier. This is a perfected magic whose only purpose is to block neutron beams.

	 To block neutron beams, magicians don't use any other magic except the Neutron barrier. This is the only magic that is suitable for blocking neutron beams. Since the magic has already been perfected, no further spells have been researched, so there is no other example of a spell capable of stopping a neutron beam at this time.

	The same can be said about the magicians of the Juumonji family.

	 Among the wide range of magic barriers included in Phalanx, only the Neutron barrier can stop neutron beams. Since the only useful spell is known ahead of time, then it cannot escape the fate of being destroyed by Tatsuya, because there is no magic that he cannot "decompose."

	 In addition to the process of converting the substance of the "Spear tip" into a neutron beam and the process of neutron return by "Regrowth", there is one additional process in Baryon Lance that is responsible for the "decomposition" of the neutron barrier.

	 Even if you defend yourself with the help of Zone Interference, this won't change anything. The neutron barrier is destroyed simultaneously with the neutralization of the Zone Interference and then the neutron beam reaches its target.

	 Katsuto had already used the Neutron barrier. The protective version of Phalanx is a magical defense that "can withstand any type of attack." In addition to protecting against high-speed objects, spraying liquids, penetrating gases, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves, psion waves, and so on, it also includes a barrier against neutron rays.

	 And Tatsuya's Baryon Lance passed through this defense. Both Tatsuya and Katsuto knew that trying to repeat would lead to the same result.

	"... I admit defeat."

	"Juumonji-kun !?"

	"Juumonji!?"

	 Under the screams of Mayumi and Mari, Katsuto got up and raised his right hand, showing that he was surrendering.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 Watching the battle through binoculars, the intelligence agent code-named "Monkey," was shocked by such an ending. The Intelligence Department expected Katsuto to win after 2 strikes. After that, they planned to kidnap the weakened Tatsuya.

	 He hurriedly turned on the communication device. It was shut down because of fear of being detected by radio wave detectors. This, as well as the use of the old-fashioned purely optical binoculars these days, was a precaution against the accidental detection of observers.

	 And even turning on the communication device, he didn't do anything careless, like sending a voice. He only sent pre-determined signals.

	 The answer came quickly. Permission to interfere.

	 His soul dropped to his heels. He was a weak magician, and his morale was destroyed by the battle he had just seen. This isn't a level which they can cope with.

	 "Monkey" belonged to the special issues unit. They couldn't rely on the Tooyama family magic like the counterintelligence unit, even though they belong to the same Intelligence Department. He didn't think that the magic of the Tooyama family, not even one of the Ten Master Clans would help against the magician of the Yotsuba family.

	 But an order is an order. The monkey rose to go to the main unit. He reassured himself that he wasn't good enough to be ordered to shoot at this monster. He cautiously stepped back so that the figures of Tatsuya and the others disappeared behind the trees, and then turned around, without looking away from that place.

	 At that moment a multicolored stream swept into his eyes. Light particles of all shades of color that a person can discern have filled his entire field of vision and moved chaotically. His mind went off in an attempt to escape from this insane glimmer.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 Tatsuya and Katsuto looked at each other. Katsuto's left arm has already been restored to its original state by Tatsuya's "Regrowth."

	"Shiba. What are you going to do with me?" Katsuto asked for the terms of his surrender.

	"You leave empty-handed and don't return with such conversations anymore." This was Tatsuya's only condition.

	 "... Understood."

	 Katsuto decided that it would be appropriate. More precisely, he understood that as the loser he couldn't object.

	"Shiba. As I said earlier, the situation has reached a state where you cannot delay any longer."

	 He couldn't help but say this.

	"The Magic Association will announce that you are Taurus Silver, despite the fact that this will irritate the Yotsuba family. And when this happens, public opinion will force you to take part in the project."

	 Tatsuya didn't say anything. It was clear that Katsuto didn't return to the previous conversation, but approaches him from the other side.

	 "If you refuse to participate in the project after that, you can hardly continue to remain in the Japanese magical community, no, in this whole country. I'm sure that even Yotsuba-dono will not be able to protect you."

	 "Even if this happens, I cannot participate in Project Dion." Tatsuya answered without hesitation.

	"Why !?" The cry of Mayumi was filled with a misunderstanding emanating from the depths of the soul.

	"Why are you so stubbornly refusing!? Going to America doesn't mean that you will become a guinea pig there, or you will work for free! In a sense Tatsuya-kun you are the official international representative of Japan. Invited to the project. And "Project Dion" itself is trying to solve the difficulties facing the future of mankind! How can you talk about refusing, setting yourself apart from all of Japan!"

	"The main advantage of the peaceful use of magic is that magicians themselves should enjoy it." Tatsuya answered Mayumi in the same tone as he had answered Katsuto's words before that. Mayumi became entangled in this game of words.

	"...What do you mean?" Mari asked when Mayumi couldn't find the words.

	"Project Dion" has a hidden purpose behind it."

	"What?"

	 "The official goal is the terraforming of Venus. A hidden goal is the expulsion from the Earth of those magicians who are considered a threat."

	"...In what sense? Tatsuya-kun, what are you saying ...?" Mayumi wondered.

	"The more I think about "Project Dion", the more I'm sure that this project is intended more to achieve the hidden goals."

	"Explain it to us."

	 Tatsuya decided to respond to Katsuto's request.

	"According to "Project Dion", in the orbit around Venus, in the asteroid belt, close to the surface of Jupiter, on Ganymede a satellite of Jupiter, many magicians would be placed directly at the stages of the project. Given the current space flight technology, those who will do this work, will not be able to return to Earth for a long time. Even if there is a certain work schedule, then most likely you will have to return to your place of work immediately after recovery.

	"It's unlikely that it will be so bad ..."

	"Magicians who meet the requirements of the project are too few in comparison to the number of people required."

	 Tatsuya rejected Mayumi's objection.

	"Magicians who are abandoned for the implementation of the projects stages will be victims for the sake of the future of mankind. The scheme in which magicians are used as tools is no different from the current situation, when magicians are used as weapons."





	◊ ◊ ◊





	 Receiving instructions from the special affairs unit agent who was watching the battle between Tatsuya and Katsuto, the Tatsuya abduction unit, prepared by the Intelligence Department, began to move.

	 Among them was Tooyama Tsukasa. She was shocked by Katsuto's defeat, but managed to not show it on her face.

	 Tsukasa's intuition whispered to her to abandon the operation and retreat. However, the current operation was the decision of the deputy director of the Intelligence Department. She didn't have the authority to stop this operation.

	 "Katsuto-san does not seem to have lost his fighting power ... the young lady from the Saegusa family will also give us strength in the event of an emergency."

	 Deceiving herself with such consolations, she silently moved forward along with the rest of the capturing squad.

	 The goal (Tatsuya) is on a closed golf course.

	 Tsukasa and her associates approached not from the side of the road leading to the golf course, but from the mountains surrounding him. Finally, from the top of the mountain they could see the goal. This moment was the beginning of the battle. At that moment, when they stepped on the densely overgrown hillside of the trees, their caution increased extremely.

	Suddenly, a stream of chaotic color appeared in front of the Intelligence Department agents. The light particles at first glance seemed to shimmer in a random order, actually depicted a color pattern that caused people to fall asleep.

	 Half of the attacking team fainted. The remaining half somehow managed to avoid this fate with the help of Tsukasa's instantly deployed personal magic barriers that were capable of blocking light magic.

	 The lieutenant appointed the commander of this attack called for the restoration of positions. However, out of more than thirty people in the platoon, fewer than twenty remained capable. Of the three officers, there was only one left on his feet.

	 Due to the collapse of the command system, the detachment was disorganized.

	 She took advantage of this moment for a surprise attack.

	 From the slope the figure of a small-looking woman rushed at them. No, their small size was an optical illusion. It was a girl with a medium height for a woman.

	 No one had time to blink an eye. She paid no attention to disturbing tree branches and overcame the distance between them approached the lead soldier, and waved her weapon with a sparkling silver gleam.

	 This weapon was a sword. Her blade stopped, crashing into the individual shield placed by Tsukasa.

	 However, the soldier, who didn't have to get a chopping blow, still fell.

	 "This is that previous hypnotic magic!"

	 At the moment when the barrier switched to anti-object mode, light magic attacked a friendly soldier knocking them asleep. Watching him fall, Tsukasa couldn't hide her confusion.

	 But the commanding lieutenant didn't understand this trick, and he didn't hesitate with the decision.

	"Fire!"

	By order of the lieutenant, the assault rifles were aimed at the girl. However, before they had time to open fire, the girl was overshadowed by a guy with a large build.

	 There were the sounds of gunfire and most of the shots hit the guy's body, but he didn't fall. There was no blood either. The bullets bounced off him.

	 "High-powered rifle detachment!"

	 The lieutenant's voice was close to screaming, but his decision was right.

	 Pushing aside the conventional assault rifles, 4 soldiers with high-powered rifles designed specifically to fight magicians readied their guns.

	 The thunder roared, but wasn't not shots of high-powered rifles, nor the sounds of real thunder. A deafening roar shook the air around him. Tsukasa's individual shields protected against sound wave attacks and none of the soldiers received significant damage from this rumble.

	 But this prevented the execution of the order.

	 The rumble didn't just happen once. As if someone was beating a drum, the sounds that shook the air were repeated again and again, as if the god of thunder descended from the ancient paintings.

	 Even their bodies were shaking so the soldiers didn't notice that it wasn't just air that was shaking. Suddenly the ground under them cracked.

	 The cracks ran in all directions. Trees began to fall, exposing their roots. The cracks were shallow. But that was enough to cause chaos in the soldiers ranks.

	"Retreat! Exit the forest!"

	 After the lieutenant gave the order, the rumble suddenly stopped.

	 Intelligence officers rarely participated in open area group battles. Usually their field of activity is the urban area. Even when it was planned that there would be a firefight, operations were usually designed with one or two agents, no more. So their running retreat could be called unorganized.

	 Their legs tangled in the grass. It seemed like the grass itself wrapped around their feet.

	 Many of them couldn't stay on their feet and fell.

	 Tsukasa couldn't understand this confusing situation. Although she had information about the positions of the allies still on their feet, she lost the coordinates of the falling soldiers, because they disappeared from her field of vision.

	 The individual shields provided by Tsukasa disappeared at the same time she lost sight of the soldiers.

	 The rain of lightning struck them, despite the fact that they were in a dense forest. Lightning came not from the sky, but from the spaces between the trees.

	 We can say that the soldiers who managed to run out of the forest found themselves in a slightly better situation than their colleagues, who had fallen under the lightning. They probably just regretted it.

	 On top of them came shells with immobilizing nets, to be sure that none of the intelligence agents escaped.

	 Tsukasa was left alone in the woods and bit her lip when she saw this scene. Her personal barriers didn't miss bullets, bombs, or poisonous gases. However, they don't give the protected partner superhuman physical abilities.

	 When the entire shield is covered in a net, they cannot escape or resist. Tsukasa couldn't even think that these nets, designed to suppress rebels, could be a natural enemy of her magic.

	So, there was only one left.

	 A sword girl with a katana, Chiba Erika turned to Tsukasa.

	 Tsukasa knew about her approach and about the fact that the way of retreat has already been blocked.

	"Chiba Erika-san?"

	"Yes that's right." Erika answered shortly. It wasn't expected by Tsukasa's talkativeness.

	"I am from the National Self-Defense Forces, Sergeant Tooyama Tsukasa."

	"Yes? Clearly."

	 Tsukasa tried to determine whether Erika's disinterested behavior was a real or an acting game, but it didn't work out.

	"Chiba Erika-san. We were actually on a mission."

	To begin with, Tsukasa decided to attack with words, ignoring the sword aimed at her.

	 "Hmm, so what?"

	 "Attacking, injuring, interfering in official state affairs, breaking the law on carrying weapons ... all these accusations can be applied to you after you've stopped us."

	 Erika took a deep breath, keeping her eyes on Tsukasa.

	 "You don't study at all, do you?"

	 It seems that Erika wasn't even a little scared.

	"What do you mean?"

	"Even if you are a soldier of Self-Defense Forces, you need permission and notice to carry weapons with you outside the base and practice grounds. You've a firearm with which there was no notice. Therefore, it is you who violated the law by carrying weapons, not us."

	"... You know quite a lot for a schoolgirl."

	 "You used guns without permission during those so-called exercises, didn't you? The police were extremely unhappy about this."

	 "But you yourself are not a policeman?"

	 "There are real policemen outside the forest. Although I can say that you already know this."

	 Saying the last words in a slightly disgruntled voice, Erika lowered her hand with the sword. But from this, she didn't have any weaknesses.

	 Without any action, she was in the "Intangible Pose" *.

	 [Another translation option: "Intangible state". Although it sounds pathetic, but it's only a pose in kenjutsu, closed from attacks from all directions.]

	"The police can request cooperation from civilian magicians to confront the magician-criminals. This is a fairly well-known exception for us, magicians, isn't it?"

	 A smile appeared on Tsukasa's face. This smile didn't carry in itself anything that could be called emotion.

	 "Therefore, please obediently let yourself be seized. Or do you want to have a little painful experience?"

	 "At the moment Erika finished speaking, Tsukasa activated a magic barrier. After that she instantly activated move-type magic. The target of the magic was herself."

	 Erika didn't panick at all, took a step to the side, avoided Tsukasa flying over her and hit her body flying past her in the torso.

	 With a sonorous metallic echo, the sword broke. The blade couldn't stand the stress from striking Tsukasa's barrier.

	 After that, Tsukasa tried to escape to the side of the mountain. But before that her way was blocked by Leo.

	 In the jump Tsukasa took the pose of a shoulder attack. Leo fortified the position of his body relative to the ground to meet this attack.

	 Tsukasa hit Leo's body.

	 Leo didn't move a millimeter, and Tsukasa jumped back. As a result, the effect of the move-type magic was cancelled.

	 Erika ran smoothly at Tsukasa.

	 At the same time, she had a stable posture, as if she was walking on a flat highway, and not making her way through the cracks and roots of trees.

	 Tsukasa got the impression that she would not be able to evade the movement to the left, to the right, or backward.

	 The only thing she could do was to protect herself with a barrier.

	 To be able to move at any time and not to run into obstacles, Tsukasa built a flat barrier in front of her body.

	 Erika swung her broken sword. The rest of the blade didn't reach Tsukasa nor her magic barrier.

	 "She didn't calculate the length of the broken blade, it's unexpected luck, and it's a chance" Tsukasa thought.

	Erika remained in a pose with the sword lowered. More accurately, she froze in it. She saw Tsukasa intending to run sideways from her, she started moving, taking the first step with her right foot.

	 The knee of this leg lost its strength and buckled. This didn't just happen with the right foot, but the left leg also suddenly collapsed. Strength disappeared from the whole body.

	 Tsukasa's body collapsed to the ground.

	 Erika came out of the fighting stance. Tsukasa looked up at her.

	 At this point, Tsukasa finally noticed that Erika's broken sword had instead of a material blade, a psion blade that looked like heat shimmer.

	 The hazy shimmering blade has disappeared.

	"Ethereal Hidden Sword Technique - Kirikage" Erika muttered

	 At that moment Tsukasa lost consciousness.





	◊ ◊ ◊





	"... The plan where magicians are used as tools is no different from the current situation, when magicians are used as weapons. I would never submit to something like that."

	 Tatsuya's announcement suppressed Katsuto, Mayumi and Mari. All present understood that Tatsuya is refusing "Project Dion" not because of simple stubbornness.

	"... But!"

	 Tatsuya's determination was clear. His convictions were understandable, but that's why Mayumi couldn't remain silent. With tears in her eyes, she couldn't stop her cry.

	 "Even if Tatsuya-kun's reasoning is correct! Tatsuya-kun will lose his home anyway! Tatsuya-kun will suffer in isolation!"

	 Tatsuya should not become a victim. It was the cry of Mayumi's heart.

	 Mayumi wanted to convey the idea that it would be better to pretend that he's participating, even if it's a lie to the people of America, Japan and the whole world. But the voice that came from the forest didn't allow Mayumi to finish speaking.

	"Tatsuya-kun won't be isolated."

	 Tatsuya and the rest were now on the smooth field of the former first hole of the closed golf course. To the right was a mountain that preserved the original terrain.

	 From the dense forest that covered the mountain slope, came four familiar people.

	 Erika. Leo. Mikihiko. Honoka.

	 Mizuki and Shizuku also clearly were somewhere nearby, although they didn't show themselves.



	"Because he has us."

	 Leo carried a woman on his shoulder. Seeing who it was, Katsuto frowned.

	 "She's familiar to Juumonji-senpai, isn't she? Could you take care of her?"

	 Leo fearlessly approached Katsuto and put Tsukasa on the ground next to him.

	 "W-we will not allow Tatsuya-san's isolation!"

	 Honoka was tense and couldn't hide her fear, but still collected all her will to say so.

	 Mikihiko, the last to speak looked Katsuto directly in the eye and said.

	 "We are Tatsuya's friends. No, not just friends. I owe Tatsuya so much that I will never be able to repay him. Even if Tatsuya becomes a criminal, I will not turn against him for anything. I will not allow Tatsuya's isolation."

	"Hey hey, Mikihiko. What obligations? We're friends. No other reason's needed."

	 Leo wrapped his arm around Mikihiko's neck in a friendly manner.

	"You're right" Mikihiko said with a strained smile.

	 Katsuto lifted Tsukasa from the ground and turned to Tatsuya.

	"Shiba. You've good friends. I'm a bit jealous."

	 Katsuto turned around and went to the off-road vehicle left by the villa.

	"Juumonji-kun, wait!"

	 Mayumi hurried after Katsuto.

	"Well well. Still lost."

	 Mari shrugged and followed Mayumi.

	 With a puzzled face, Tatsuya looked at his friends. All of them wore embarrassed smiles. Only Erika tried to turn away, but she couldn't hide a smiling face.

	 Tatsuya turned to Miyuki. Tears flowed from her eyes, and she tried to wipe them with her fingers.





	CHAPTER 10





	Monday, morning.

	 Tatsuya was left alone again in the Izu villa. Last night Miyuki returned to her new home in Chofu before it got too late.

	 He ate Pixie's cooked breakfast and watched the news channel on TV even if most of it he ignored. It felt as if Miyuki were still sitting at the table in front of him.

	 This morning breakfast should have ended as usual. But this morning the TV gave disappointing news.

	"This is a special news item."

	 Hearing the speaker's alarmed voice Tatsuya raised his head.

	"Please watch this video message first."

	 The focus of the on-screen picture shifted to the large monitor to the side of the announcer. The monitor turned on and displayed the upper body of a suspicious looking person. At first glance it was difficult to understand whether it was a man or a woman. Not only was their sex indeterminable, but also their age and race.

	 This man was wearing a gray robe with a hood draped over, and his face was covered with a white plastic mask.

	 The voice of a mysterious person from the monitor's speakers was transmitted in the studio.

	"I am one of the Seven Sages. With your permission, I'll be called Sage Number One. "

	 The voice clearly went through electronic processing, and even using supercomputers the original voice cannot be restored.

	 "I would like to tell the truth to the people of Japan."

	 Despite his fluent Japanese, Tatsuya thought he wasn't Japanese.

	 Thinking about this and the name "Seven Sages," he remembered the face of one guy. A guy from the " Seven Sages" who sent a videotape at the end of the vampire incident. The name of the guy who was friends with Shizuku while studying abroad, it seemed to be Raymond Clark.

	 "Clark ..."

	 Tatsuya clung to this name, but first of all he decided to see what will happen next in the news.

	"I wish that the proposed "Project Dione" can be started as soon as possible. For this reason, I also hope for Taurus Silver's participation from Japan. "

	 Three people were connected to each other in Tatsuya's head.

	 Edward Clark.

	 Raymond Clark.

	 The identity of this mysterious person.

	I want the participation of Taurus Silver, that is, Mr. Shiba Tatsuya.

	 The true identity of this mysterious person, "Sage Number One" is Raymond Clark.

	 Raymond Clark is a relative of Edward Clark.

	 "Taurus Silver is Mr. Shiba Tatsuya, a third-year student from the National Magic University Affiliated First High. People of Japan. I want you to persuade Mr. Shiba Tatsuya."

	 The video message has ended.

	 Raymond Clark's participation was unexpected for Tatsuya. He didn't take into account that Raymond would interfere.

	 He was preparing countermeasures in case the Magic Association discovers the identity of Taurus Silver.

	 He had measures in case of pressure from the government.

	 He even considered measures if Edward Clark's patience ran out.

	 But all these measures will not work in the circumstances.

	 Tatsuya realized that he's been hunted into a corner.

	 (To be continued in the "Escape" ark)





	AFTERWARD





	After the afterword there will be a few more explanations and a storyline, don't forget to read if you don't read the afterwords:

	 • Explanation of the magic of Erika, Honoka and Mikihiko from Chapter 9-2

	 • An explanation of how these guys got there at all



	It was the 23rd volume in the series, "Isolation." Did you like it?

	 "Isolation" was an episode I wanted to write as quickly as possible, even from the start of my work on this story.

	 The name "Isolation" was given from the very beginning of the writing of this volume, but the basis leading to the culmination has not changed until the very debut of this volume.

	 In short, the main idea was confrontation with "Katsuto, the strongest enemy at the moment." The new magic "Baryon Lance" was conceived for use here.

	 This episode, among other things, also had to lead to some reflection. When I wrote (Continuation in ...), along with a feeling of complete exhaustion, I got the idea "I finally wrote it ...".

	 Just because I have never written so well. All the prerequisites for the planned confrontation of those two turned out to be bricks ...

	 As a result, there were very few corrections. For example, when I wrote an episode with Fumiya's women's dressing, I remarked: "Didn't he show his face in the Nine Schools Competition ...?", So I had to rewrite it a little. ... Well, it really was fun.

	 As you probably already knew, this arch "Isolation" is one of the culminations of the entire series "The Untrucky Apprentice in the School of Magic." But this isn't the highest culmination.

	 The current confrontation was, one might say, a conflict between the allies. But real enemies are others. Perhaps the readers already had an idea who could become an enemy, corresponding to the "final boss". ... Even if you think so, you are waiting for one more "this is the turn."

	 Events in history will continue to heat up.

	 While the main stream of the story is being written, there are also aspects in it that make it unintentional to describe the circumstances and disclose the details behind them. This may seem correct for short novels, but with my writing style, I cannot deny my feeling of lack of explanation. Therefore, I think that I will just add further what I had to miss in this volume. Although many probably don't like superfluous text, I'll still add a few pages after the afterword.

	 This volume presented a fictional plan for the development of Venus, called the "Project Dion." Hiago Naoyuki-sama from JAXA, Sakurai Naoko-sama from the Japan Space Forum, as well as the author of scientific articles, Kashiwai Isana-sama provided me with a lot of valuable information on this issue. In addition, Kashiwai-sama introduced me to the science fiction writer Fuji Taiyo. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to you.

	 I write this afterword right before the movie is released. I myself haven't watched the preliminary show. Although I have only information from the production stage, but I'm sure it will be an interesting sight. It will be an exciting movie, worthy of large screens of cinemas. Everyone who came to the cinema, how do you like it? I believe that you were satisfied.

	 The name of the next volume is "Escape" *. I think it will be "Escape (part 1)".

	 [The author's name is written in English. Given his love of ambiguous phrases, it is still unclear how to translate this, "escape," "flight," "salvation." Given the explicit hint of E.S.C.P.E.S, I think it's better to leave it in Latin.]

	 Ranobeh version of the movie, I'll probably finish it sooner. I'm going to write a "full version", which also includes scenes cut from the theatrical version. However, we haven't yet decided how we will publish this. I'll let you know as soon as it's decided.

	 So, I sincerely hope to meet you again in the next volume, "Escape". And maybe the next will be "The Girl Calling the Stars (full version)."

	Concerning Erika's "Techniques of the Hidden Sword," Kirikage (literally the Shadow Section). You could see her for the first time in the theatrical version of "The Girl Calling the Stars". I imported a new magic into the novel, created specifically for the theatrical version of the film.

	 It refers to non-systemic magic. Having an immaterial blade created from compressed psions, it can cut the psion information body inside the human body.

	 The psion information body, which is the target of the attack, isn't the Eidos of the human body, but something similar to a form-watching image formed in a natural way, repeating the contours of the body in the material world. There is no strong connection with the essence of Eidos, but advanced masters of martial arts control their body, moving first this "image-watching image."

	 The cut of the shadow is, it might be said, a dirty trick that uses the surprise effect and cuts the "shadow" of the enemy, depriving him of control of the body.

	 This technique Erika studied as a means of attacking the psion information body, since she had no means against the Parasites in the ark "Guest." It was a secret technique that only the head of Chiba's family, Chiba Joyiro, could use. But my father didn't teach her. She was able to comprehend it herself, having studied the secret texts.

	 The light that put the intelligence squad moving through the forest to attack Tatsuya was the magic of Honoka's "Hypno-Eye."

	 It was an improved version of The Evil Eye that Honoka already used to lull intelligence officers in volume 11, page 134. Instead of specializing in the magical "sleepy" effect, parameters such as power, range, and number of targets were raised.

	 It was the same magic that Mikihiko used against Kichijouji on the Novelty Division's Monolith Code. This is a combination of magic from "Earthquake," "Split Earth," "Wild Hair," and "Descendant of Thunder."

	 © The reason that Erika and the others were present where this "raid" was conducted

	 Why Erika and others were able to defeat Tsukasa and the capture squad from the Intelligence Department?

	 I missed the explanation for this, because I thought that it would have a bad effect on the tempo set at the end of the volume, but after Katsuto, Mayumi and Mari left, there was such a conversation in the villa's living room.

	 "By the way, Erika, those people who came with you are SMAT from the police?"

	M? Yes, that's right.

	 "It's not an accident, is it?" How did you know that today the Self-Defense Forces will come here?

	 "And we didn't know that it would be Self-Defense Forces ... Miyuki's behavior was a bit unnatural, and I realized that something will happen today."

	Uh, my behavior?

	 "Miyuki, you said then that Juumonji-senpai will come today to keep us, isn't it?"

	Y-yes.

	 "I mean, did you've to say this?" You could just say, for example, "this isn't the time." But if Juumonji-senpai comes to talk with Tatsuya-kun, then is it not necessary to keep it a secret?

	Ah ...

	Then I just obediently agreed. But I realized that something will happen there. I thought that unwanted guests could come in and collect people from the dojo.

	 With such a prehistory, Erika came to Izu with a squad of police special forces, assembled from the students of the Chiba dojo.

	 This concludes the additional materials. See you in the next volume "Escape."
