Shia’s Usamimi’s moved around ~Piko Piko~ and she edged her but into contact with Hajime. Her eyes that were looking at Hajime were already moistening and contained heat, and her sighs contained enough heat that it seems like it’ll burn on contact. The implied meaning, Hajime had certainly understood what Shia was saying but, he was daringly pretending to have not noticed.



[…..It’ll be fine as long as you’re still the same happy-go-lucky woman and laughing. You’re our mood-maker after all?]



[Mo~u, what’s with that, happy-go-lucky you say! Even though you hugged me in front of the Emperor and said I was important! This is the scene where say, [Then I’ll have you repay with your body then, guhhehhehhe!], and attack me isn’t it. Please read the atmosphere]



[It seems that we need to have a thorough talk about the image that you see me in]



[You’re a single-minded good for nothing]



[Being single-minded there is usually a good thing though]



Shia puffed out her cheeks to show that she was dissatisfied. However, she quickly hung her head down disappointedly. Her Usamimi’s also hung down as if they suddenly lost their power.



[……I’m serious, I want to do something to thank you. Ever since I’ve met Hajime-san and everyone else, I’ve l always gave it my all*I think, ?????????????*. Although Hajime-san and Yue-san says that its fine if I just laugh but, just being with you 2 will naturally make me feel happy, it’s definitely nothing like showing gratitude]



[But still, you’re our companion right? I don’t think you have to continuously think about such things]



[It’s courtesy in intimate relationships. I want to properly thank Hajime-san and Yue-san as well. …..I’ve thought about it variously but, I just can’t seem to think of anything. Hajime-san says that he doesn’t need my body after all…..even though he tightly embraced me and said I was important, to tell me that I’m not needed…..]



[Don’t sulk now…..]



Hajime was showing a troubled expression now that Shia was being timid. Even though he was being told that she wanted to express her gratitude, helping someone related to you was the natural course of action, really, just one word, [Thanks] would have been enough.



But, for Shia, those feelings didn’t seem to sit well with her.



[If Hajime-san has fallen for me then I wouldn’t be going through all these hardships. I’d fully service (thank) you…..ha~a, there’s no helping it then. I’ll try harder to be much more useful than before as we travel in order to relay my thanks]



[I see]



When Shia shrugged her shoulders, once again, she looked up towards the Montofaruta up above.



While looking at her stature, Hajime was suddenly beginning to remember when he embraced Yue and Shia in front of Gaharudo.



Being truthful, that was pretty much done unconsciously. Once he came to, he had already embraced both of them.



As of now, the huge feelings of declaring someone as “Special” could only be said to Yue. That’s something that can be firmly declared. However, even if it was unconsciously, the reason why he held Shia within his arms was…….



Thinking up to that point, Hajime had a smile filled with self-mockery.



How could this be, ma~a, it was because he was selfish. While saying that no one was able to be on par with Yue, to have the desires to possess Shia, it was truly selfish. Once he realised it, Shia’s existence somehow became much larger than before. At the very least, as much as Yue where he unconsciously embraced her so that he wouldn’t lose her.



Although he’ll likely still hold more feelings for Yue than any other person, even still, he doesn’t seem to be able to deceive himself about his desire for Shia anymore. Once he became aware of it, he wasn’t able to pretend that it wasn’t there. If so then, do your best so work hard, how about taking on the attitude of the girl who came with them? Hajime suddenly thought.



[Eh, Ehtto, what is it? It’s extremely embarrassing to be quietly stared at….]



Once he came to, Shia’s cheeks were dyed red blushing shyly and squirming nervously. Her Usamimi as well as if saying, [U~u, why are you looking~], it suddenly dropped down, occasionally, she’d squirm around and look towards Hajime.



Hajime’s eyes soften up when he sees Shia like this and he reached out with his hand. And her shy Usamimis were gently stroked.



[Ha, Hajime-san?]



[……Na~a, Shia. I’ve got a favor I want to ask…..]



[A favor? Of course, it’s fine! Feel free to ask for anything]



For a moment, she was surprised by Hajime’s words, since she could show her gratitude even a little bit, Shia consented willingly while smiling.



[No, lets see, I kinda want to lie down for a bit. If you’re up for it, can I ask for a lap pillow?]



[Fu~e, even if you didn’t ask, please use it anytime. Sa~a, please step right up]



[Thanks]



Although Shia showed a slightly disappointed expression from Hajime’s request, she was happy that she was giving him a lap pillow and she patted her thighs with a bright smile. Hajime expressed his thanks with a smile and laid down without hesitation.



Because Shia wore a miniskirt, he was able to fully feel the feelings of her thighs. A soft and warm puffy feeling supported Hajime’s head. It faintly resembled Yue’s, as a sweet scent tickled his nose.



[Fufu, it’s unfortunate for Kaori-san and Teio-san. Around this time, they’re fighting against Yue-san in order to give Hajime-san a lap pillow, but I’ve already taken it ahead of them]



[Ma~a, Yue’ll win anyways so there’s no reason to worry about it?]



[You shouldn’t say such things. Since they’re want to make Hajime-san fall for them they’re working hard. Really, I wonder when will Hajime-san finally fall for me~]



[…..Will you give up?]



[No way~]



[I see~]



Shia was gently stroking Hajime’s hair. Hajime narrowed his eyes as he became comfortable. And as payback, he played with Shia’s hair that hung down before him. The pale blue white hair was really mysterious when it was combined with the light being emitted by the Montofaruta that were above them.



If someone had seen Shia and Hajime right now, they would have surely had an face which vomited due to the sugar. That was how sweet those two’s atmosphere was. Right, it was exactly like the separate world that Hajime and Yue created.



However, unfortunately, although it was the atmosphere which was created with Yue that Shia longed for, she didn’t notice at all. On that part, perhaps Shia could truly be called a regrettable rabbit.



Even with the actual person not realising, the sweet time continued to flow gently. Within the moonlight where the Montofaruta illuminated, Hajime and Shia were enjoying their time alone with each other.



*lol Author notes that it’s getting near the end so there should at least be some kind of progression with another girl other than Yue*





Chapter 124




In the dense fog that clung onto bodies, people’s shadow could be seen moving on without hesitation.



It was Hajime and them.



With Shia in the front, Hajime and them are currently heading towards the big tree. It’s the second day after they’ve arrived at Fair Bergen, the cycle for the path to the big tree to open has finally come.



Within that time, there were various disturbances which Hajime and them were caught up in as they stayed in Fair Bergen but, if you compare it with what usually happens, it’s likely not to such a high extent that it couldn’t be categorized as their daily lives.



Mainly, the thing with Kouki and the freed slaves (girls), a group of male Demi-human’s were doing this and that to hajime because of the thing with Arutena, and Ryutaro was doing this and that with the Demi-humans martial arts masters……those kind of stories.



Along the way, forest demons launched a surprise attack under the fog. However, Hajime and the rest, Yue, Shia, Teio, and the Hauria didn’t deal with it at all, they left everything up to Kouki and them. Since they didn’t know what kind of trials the great labyrinth [Harutsuina Sea of Trees] holds, as a warm up they were told to take out the demons.



To begin with, because the Sea of Trees drives the senses of other races besides the Demi-humans mad, it was completely different than fighting against the demons at [Orcus Great Labyrinth], Kouki and them were having a pretty hard fight. They kept teasing by using hit and run tactics repeatedly and Ryutaro was plainly irritated at the demons who made full use of the dense fog.



[……There! Like this….this!]



Within there, Kaori was mixed into Kouki and them’s repeated combat.



Kaori still wasn’t completely in full control of Nointo’s body yet so she was there voluntarily to train. It appears that, the dense fog didn’t effect Nointo’s body as much, it seems to be just the right adjustment for the battle experience and trace skills that Nointo had.



Even now, while fluttering her wings which shined in silver, it shot out silver feathers to repel the demons. It appears that she’s gotten used to using the silver feathers, as if they were homing missiles, they launched out at the demons and instantly decomposed them to nothingness.



[Ya!]



In addition, while giving out a shout, the approaching demons who slipped past the silver feathers were wonderfully cut into 2 by the great sword that was clad in silver light that was pulled out in an instant.



It seems that she still couldn’t wield them freely like how Nointo did but, if its just one hit then she’s considerably skilled. At the very least, it was at the level where she couldn’t be embarrassed to call herself a “Swordsman”.



[I seem to be considerably getting used to this. It’s worthwhile that I get into a fight with Yue everyday] *<-This part may be wrong, it sounds different from what the machine’s actually giving me, ????????????????*



[…….Your spec’s are abnormal. I can’t afford to be careless]



Hajime let out a breath and muttered, [Fuu~], as he watched Kaori’s figure.



Although she’s still not on the original Nointo’s level yet which was able to give the Hajime at full power a hard fight, but if you think about her growth rate, it was wonderful since it was still only around 10 days since her soul was transferred. Kaori’s diligence is likely allowing her to rapidly master Nointo’s fighting power.



[That’s not true. I’m still not accustomed to using magic while fighting, if I don’t concentrate on Decomposition it wont activate as well…..I still can’t even get a hit off of Yue]



It appears that she heard the conversation between Hajime and Yue, Kaori was pouting as she moved forwards. She wants to quickly become stronger, she has the image but, she’s frustrated that it doesn’t go as she thought it would…..those kind of feelings are reflected on her expression.



[…….Kaori. What are you saying. Your physical abilities exceeds ours, you have the brutal ability of decomposition in your silver wings, and you’ve got aptitude in all attributes and can use magic without having to chant and without magic formations. Your swordsmanship is also progressing limitlessly like a joke as well, due to your proficiency in recovery magic, your defenses are like a fortress, even if they successfully inflict a wound onto you, it’ll heal up immediately….it’s already unsuitable to call you a cheat anymore, you’re more like a bugged character. Yet you’re still dissatisfied?]



Shizuku pointed out her specs as if she was amazed, Kaori had felt that she definitely felt like a monster so she just let her eyes wander around.



[But, I can’t defeat Yue or Shia…..if I’m a bugged character then, what are Hajime-kun and them?]



[…..Something hard to describe or something…like that…..]



Shizuku was showing a difficult expression as she thought of the best way to describe Hajime and them, it seems that nothing came to mind in the end. Kouki called out to Shizuku.



[It’s fine, Shizuku. As long as we can clear the great labyrinth then even we can become as strong as Nagumo. No, if you think about Nagumo’s non-fighting class, surely we’d be able to be stronger than him]



[Looks like it. I’m looking forwards to find out what kind of magic we’ll obtain]



[Un, lets do our best!]



Although Hajime’s strength doesn’t come solely from Age of Gods magic, Kouki who was through with it was strongly clenching his fist. Ryutaro and Suzu also seemed to have been pumped up.



[Every~one, We’ve reached it~]



When Kouki and them were firing themselves up, Shia tells them of their arrival at the big tree as she looked back over her shoulder. When Hajime and them chased after Shia who advanced ahead and disappeared into the other side of the fog, they arrived at a space that had no fog. Towering in front was a withered huge tree just exactly like they saw before.



[This is…..the big tree…..]



[It’s large…..]



[It’s extremely……huge]



While looking above their heads, they weren’t even able to see the top of the big tree, Kouki and them had their mouths opened absentmindedly as its width was so long it was as if they were standing in front of a wall. Surely it was the same expression anyone else would have had when seeing it for the first time, Hajime and Yue had a small smile while looking at eachother.



Hajime approached the lithograph while pulling out all the proofs that he’s obtained from the other great labyrinths out of his “Treasure Warehouse”. The lithograph hasn’t changed since last time, crests of the 7 great labyrinths are drawn on the front and it’s back was hollow in order to allow the proofs to be place in.



While crouching down, Hajime was playing with the 5 proofs in his palm, Kouki and them were finally freed from the large tree’s dignified appearance and focused on Hajime. From now on it’ll be a place where anything can truly happen at anytime. While bracing themselves, Hajime looked sharply at Kouki and them.



[Cam, Since we don’t know what’ll happen from now on, back off with the Hauria tribe]



[Roger, boss. May fortune be with you]



By Fair Bergen’s negotiations, the south land with the big tree became Cam and their territory but, from Hajime’s words his expression became a bit disappointed, However he still decided to salute and then everyone spread out together.



When he confirmed that, Hajime slowly placed the [Orcus Great Labyrinth] ring of proof into the hollow section of the lithograph. Once it was placed, the lithograph began to shine faintly and characters appeared.



“4 proofs”



“Power of Reproduction”



“Guidepost of weaved bonds”



“A path for a new trial shall be open for those who have everything”



[This is the same as before as well. The used proof….is anything other than [Kamiyama] fine]



Hajime went ahead and set the proofs into the lithograph that while muttering. [Raisen’s Ring][Guryuen’s Pendant][Merujine’s Coin]……



Each time one was set into the lithograph, it’s light strengthened up. And immediately after placing the final coin, the light was set free and it scattered onto the front of the big tree, this time the big tree was the one that shined brightly.



[Mu? A crest has appeared on the big tree]



[…..Next is, the power of Reproduction?]



As Teio muttered with great interest, a pattern of the 7 angel systems stood out on the trunk of the large tree. Yue walked towards the shining pattern and while quietly touching it she used Reproduction magic.



Immediately afterwards,



Pa~aaaaa!!



The big tree was wrapped up in a light uncomparable to before, a wave of light was continuously rippling towards the top from the place that Yue had touched.



The big tree that was shining brightly, gradually revived as the light spread out to every corner as if it was absorbing water from its roots.



[Ah, leaves…..]



Shia pointed at the leaves which appeared as the tree regained it’s vitality with each passing moment. It was almost like looking at the birth of life, Hajime and them were staring at what was in front of their eyes with a mysterious feeling, the big tree was quickly growing and it regained its bright green looks.



As a slightly strong wind blew by, the sound of the large tree’s leaves rustling around could be heard. Then, at the next moment, all of the sudden, the front of the tree trunk was split from the right and left and a cave appeared. It was a big cave which could fit several tens of people.



Hajime and them looked at each others faces and nodded to each other and stepped into the cave without hesitation.



Hajime was slightly concerned——would the other members who have not captured 4 great labyrinths actually be able to challenge the great labyrinth of the Sea of Trees, but it appears that it was pointless worries. Everyone was able to enter the cave without a problem.



It was probably like the other great labyrinths in the stance of, [If you want to enter, it’s fine as long as you have what’s necessary. However, your life is not guaranteed].



Hajime looked around the surroundings. But, there didn’t seem to be anything particular in the cave. It was simply a huge space which extended out like a dome.



[Is it a dead-end?]



Kouki muttered out doubtfully.



Immediately afterwards, the entrance to the cave began to shut as if it had been reverse-reproductioned.



The light from the outside gradually thinned out. Hajime scolded Kouki who instinctively panicked. When the entrance was completely shut, the inside of the cave was wrapped in darkness, immediately Yue secured a light source and held it up in her hand. However there was no need for it.



That’s because a huge magic formation appeared underneath their legs and it emitted strong light.



[Uwa, what’s this!]



[What’s up! What is this!]



[Quit making so much noise! Its a transfer magic formation! Don’t be careless when you’re transferred!]



After Hajime warned the shaken Ryutaro and Suzu, their view blacked out.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



[~…….This is……]



What reflected in Hajime and their view when the light returned was a lush forest. A sea of trees inside of a tree…..created an indescribably odd situation.



[Is everyone alright?]



Kouki lightly shook his head and confirmed his surroundings for the safety of his comrades. There Shizuku and them, [We’re fine], replied. Yue, Shia, Teio, and Kaori didn’t seem to have any particular problems either, they watched their surroundings with caution.



[Nagumo, this is really the great labyrinth right? ……Which way should we progress in?]



The place where Hajime and them were transferred to was, a vacant circled lot where they were completely surrounded by trees in 360 degrees, there wasn’t a guidepost indicating which way they should go either.



Since it’s covered in a dense fog, it doesn’t seem like flying overhead to look for a path would be useful. That’s why Kouki asked Hajime who had lots of experience with great labyrinths.



[……For the time being, we’ve got no choice but to look around]



Hajime muttered out with a slightly displeased expression, he placed his hand onto the trunk of a tree and activated “Tracing”. A magic mark was created, a bright red arrow was placed onto the tree and pointing in the direction where they were going.



When Kouki and them saw that they nodded. It seems they understood that they had no choice but to search while placing signs. And they took the lead since they heard that even if you cleared the labyrinth, if they weren’t recognized by the great labyrinth then they wouldn’t be able to obtain Age of Gods magic.



The other members followed behind successively. However, only Hajime didn’t move from his place as his eyes retained coldness within it. As they began to walk, Shia noticed and a “?” appeared over her head as she turned back towards Hajime.



[……Hajime-san? Whats wro—-]



Shia called out to Hajime……in that moment,



Shuba!



When they heard that wind-like noise ring out, in a instant Yue and Teio, as well as Ryutaro were coiled by a wire, with both spheres on both ends fixed into the air they were restrained. Hajime had taken out the bola from his “Treasure Warehouse” and quickly thrown them to bind them.



Yue, Teio, and Ryutaro wiggled around as they struggled. When Kouki and them saw that they were dumbfounded. However, once they regained their sanity and as if it was able to produce a ~Ki~ sound they immediately glared strongly at Hajime.



[Nagumo! What exactly are you doing!]



Kouki instinctively raised his voice angrily. Shizuku and them had tensed expressions as their eyes conveyed that they wanted an explanation from Hajime.



[……Be quiet for a bit]



However, Hajime only said that and didn’t answer Kouki and their doubts and silently looked towards Yue, he briskly walked up towards her who was expressionless.



And, as Yue looked up at Hajime perplexedly, Hajime pressed Donner against her forehead. His eyes had a coldness of absolute zero within them, it was obvious that Hajime was completely furious in anger.



[Hajime….What i-]



Yue had a, I can’t believe it, expression as Hajime pointed his muzzle at her. And when she tried to voice out her doubt as she called Hajime’s name.



However, immediately after that,



Dopan!



Hajime pulled Donner’s trigger without hesitation. A dry explosive noise echoed throughout the sea of trees. For now, although the muzzle was removed from Yue’s forehead and pointed towards her shoulder, even still it didn’t change the fact that Hajime had shot his beloved lover.



Towards that fact, it was obvious that Kouki and them as well as Shia and them were intensely shaken. And they looked at Hajime with eyes that doubted his sanity.



[Wha, what are you doing! Nagumo-kun!]



[Hajime-kun! Stop!]



Shizuku and Kaori raised their voices to attempt to stop Hajime who was filled with rage but, Shia finally noticed the sense of incongruity and held onto Kaori and them by the hand instead.



Although there was an air like Kouki would spring at any moment to try and restrain Hajime but, that disappeared after Hajime’s next words.



[Don’t speak without permission, Imitations. You’re only an imitation and you dare imitate Yue’s voice. If you dare to call my name with that voice again. I’ll scrape off your hands and feet]



The moment Hajime uttered his voice, as if the ground was arctic cold, the air was filled with coldness. However the temperature hasn’t actually fallen. Murderous intent was overflowing from his body and in turn dropped the heat that life was giving out. Somehow, even the surroundings became dark. Towards the dense murderous intent, Kouki and them naturally became shallow breathed and cold sweat ran down like a waterfall.



[What are you? Where is the real Yue?]



[………]



Yue’s appearance was as if stating, “What is it”, with her expression and was silently unmoved in her stance *<-I improvised and have a feeling the ending here is incorrect by a lot, ???????“??”?????????????????????????????*. Rather than “Who are you” it was “What are you”, this was because blood was not flowing from where she was shot in the shoulder. It was obvious that it wasn’t a “person”.



Dopan!



This time Hajime shot through the opposite shoulder. However the fake Yue still didn’t change her expression. It appears that they didn’t have a sense of pain. Just like Nointo, they carried an image as if they were puppets, or they may not actually have any will of their own.



[Are you not going to answer. ……No, do you not have a function to answer. Then its fine already. Die]



Dopan!



This time Hajime pointed Donner’s muzzle onto Yue’s forehead and used a rail gun to blast her head off. Behind Yue (Fake), something was splattering and scattering.



Although Shizuku and them instinctively turned away from it, if you took the time to look at it, it wasn’t a brain but a rust colored slime that had scattered. Yue’s (Fake) body which lost it’s head was beginning to melt after one beat, it similarly turned into a rust colored slime and stained into the ground.



Hajime continued to shoot through Teio and Ryutaro’s heads consecutively while they were still restrained by the bola. As the two people splattered Kouki and them instinctively had goosebumps but, as expected they turned into a rust colored slime and were inhaled into the ground just like the Yue (Fake) slime.



[Chi. As expected of a great labyrinth. Starting right off the bat….]



Hajime cursed out as he holstered Donner.



[Hajime-san…..Yue-san and Teio-san are…..]



[They must have been transferred to a different location from earlier. There was a slight sense of the feeling when our memories were being searched by Age of Gods magic. The rust colored slimes who obtained the memories used their mimic abilities to disguise themselves, it felt like they had openings from behind?] *<-Unsure about this part, ?????????????????*



Hajime’s expression distorts into a bad mood as his lover turned into soup. Shizuku and Suzu nodded as if they felt admiration as they heard Hajime’s guess.



[I see. …..Even still you’ve done good to notice]



[Un un, Suzu wasn’t able to tell the difference at all. How did you notice?]



Suzu asked for Hajime’s identification tips as it would be troubling if they couldn’t distinct their own comrades apart. Kouki looked at Hajime with interest as well while worrying about the safety of his best friend.



Hajime’s answer towards that question was….



[Even if you asked me. …..I can only say that the instant I saw them, I noticed. What was before my eyes was “Not my Yue”]



[ [ [ [ [……..] ] ] ] ]



In a sense, all members lost their strength when the answer was him speaking fondly of his sweetheart.



[Then, how about Ryutaro-kun and Teio-san?]



[Once you know that there are imposters then, with the “Magic Eye Stone” if you look carefully you can see a sense of incongruity. That’s why you don’t have to worry as long as you’re with me from now on]



Is that so~, Kouki and them looked at Hajime amazedly. Within that, as if Shia thought of something she went, ~ha~, while fidgeting she asked Hajime while expecting something.



[Ano, Hajime-san…..if it was me, would you also notice it in an instant?]



[ ! ]



Kaori who was next to Shia reacted, in her glance she asked, [How about me?]. Somehow or another eyes were attracted to Hajime. Inside of the delicate bittersweet atmosphere, Hajime answered plainly without much vigor.



[Sa~a? Isn’t it impossible for just a moments glance?]



[ [……..] ]



Usually while one was reading the air, [Of course, Isn’t it obvious that I’d realize it?], and answer like that but, this was part of Hajime’s quality. While thinking that he mercilessly answered.



Unintentionally Shia and Kaori continued to stare at him but, Hajime continued to advance into the depths of the sea of trees while being indifferent about the two people’s glances.



[It’s questionable how he can have such strong nerves….]



[Au, Kaolin, Shiashia, cheer up!]



[Kaori is really, what about that guy is…..]



While following after Hajime, Shizuku and them glanced at Shia and Kaori who puffed their cheeks in a bad mood from their appeal. While having various problems at the the start of the line, they stepped into the sea of trees.



By the way, in his mind, [If it was Shia I’d know], is what Hajime had thought but…..he had just decided to take on an honest attitude but he carelessly said that bluntly so he may very well be a tsundere.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Vuu~uu”uu”uu”uu”!!



Exactly like an electric fan moving at maximum speeds, that kind of sound was echoing in the sea of trees. It wasn’t one or two either. It was the buzzing of countless numbers. Translucent wings that were flapping at super-high speeds were already like a kind of attack as the noise reverates.



[Uu~, gross~, “Beyond Heaven-ugh”!]



[Don’t whine! Suzu, it went that way!]



[Ku, it’s quick! “Heavenly Flying Sword”!] *<-What I’m calling it, ???*



Suzu looking like she wanted to cry as she was holding in the physiological disgust she felt from looking at the demon.



That may be something that can’t be helped. After all, the reason for the buzzing was a toddler sized “Bee”. If you compared it in form then it would be a hornet. The super-huge bee-typed demon were attacking in swarms with their tough jaws and lethal stingers.



With a malicious yellow and black hue, their jaws creaked as it opened and closed, their stingers had green liquid dripping from it, their feet that waved around eerily, and their dark red compound eyes……it certainly was a creature that you’d want to avoid.



Moreover, this bee-typed demon were hard to deal with because they were quick and they cooperated in groups. Furthermore, they could continuously shoot out their needles since a new one would immediately grow in its place, from mid-range it was exactly like a machine-gun so there was the threat of being swept by a rain of stingers.



Somehow Suzu’s barriers were keeping out the stingers, as opposed to Kouki’s method of hammering them with a single blow, Shizuku was breaking apart their cooperation and speed, however the swarm of bee’s were not decreasing in numbers at all.



[Damn, these guys, they’re exactly like the Majinzoku’s demons!]



[No, it’s reversed isn’t it? They’re monsters are similar to the great labyrinth’s monsters]



Kouki wielded his sacred sword with a desperate look, he remembered the scene of bloodshed that they experienced previously and unintentionally cursed out. They had absolutely no space to relax because the great labyrinth’s monsters were so strong.



At the moment a mantis-shaped demon that was around 2 meters in length was about to do a surprise attack on Kouki from behind but, Hajime killed it in an instant and tsukkomied at the same time.



A slight distance away from Hajime, Shia was killing 3 meter ant-typed demons in a single hit with Doryukken and blasting through the ground building a mountain of corpses. Kaori wasn’t losing either, she continuously shot out silver feathers and close to 30 bee’s were already shot down and decomposed.



When Kouki saw the spectacle that came into view, he grit his teeth as he feels the difference between Hajime and their powers once again.



[“Beyond Heaven-ugh” “Beyond Heaven-ugh”! It’s useless. We’ll be overwhelmed!]



Suzu who was close to tears, created several shining shields, she kept repeatedly building new ones as soon as the previous ones were destroyed, Suzu’s magical power was mercilessly shaved down.



“Beyond Heaven” is not that strong but its strength is that it can be produced in great numbers, Suzu was a “Barrier Master” so her barriers also carried enough strength to take on several attacks from normal demons before they were destroyed.



However, in front of the bee-typed demon’s stingers that they shot out, those barriers were instantly broken as if they were paper waste, currently Suzu was being forced to deploy barriers at unprecedented speeds.



Little by little, little by little, the deployment of barriers were being delayed and the scene of flying stingers gradually fills the distance, it was as if she was being strangled by a line of silk and it damaged Suzu’s mind.



[Run rampant, “Thunder Flower”! mince them, “Flash Claw”!]*<-What I’m calling it, ??*



Along with Shizuku’s chants, a sinister flower of thunder bloomed in the sky, and a claw of wind minced through. She demonstrated her black katana’s abilities on the approaching bee-typed demons.



With her sharp swordsmanship, she was certainly feeling the feedback of the demons being torn apart. With Shizuku being a Speed Fighter, being paired up against the bees was a good match. While disturbing their cooperation with her free movement skill “No Rhythm”, one by one she was sure to slaughter them.



However, the bee-typed demon’s strength was their numbers. Even if she could defeat them, Shizuku was lacking in overwhelming annihilation powers. Hence, the war situation was that they were gradually being pushed, Shizuku who noticed that had a bitter expression.



[Will of the blade, harboring light which will tear apart the enemy! “Light Blade”!]



Thanks to Shizuku, Kouki was able to chant as he liked and his sacred sword was coated by a sword of light.



The light blade extended his sacred sword by about another 2 meters in length. Kouki swung the huge blade of light while rotating his body in one motion which cut through all gathered surrounding bee-typed demons.



However because the motion of the attack held too many openings, the demons charged in towards him. In response his body was hurled backwards.



[Ku, why you!]



[Kouki!]



The bee-typed demon was about to thrust its stinger into him but, fortunately, Kouki’s sacred armor prevented the stinger from coming near, Kouki somehow managed to use that chance to get up and cut off it’s head.



He had no room to answer Shizuku’s worried voice. In the next moment, he was attacked by huge quantities of demons so Kouki needed to finish recovering his balance.



[Uo~ooooo!]



Although Kouki waved his sacred sword while shouting, the demons in the great labyrinth weren’t sweet enough to spare you any time when you’ve exposed a chance. At last, a bee-typed demon managed to slip past the sacred sword and get behind him, it then clung onto him from behind like spikes on shoes, it was trying to use its jaws to tear through Kouki’s neck.



[~!?]



Kouki raised a voiceless scream.



in that juncture,



Dopan!



A gunshot.



The moment when the bee’s jaws were about to pierce through Kouki’s neck, a flash of light surged out from the side as it cut through the sky and easily blew off the bee-typed demon’s head off.



Kouki who was unsteady due to the aftereffect, ignored the heat that he felt on his neck and separated himself from the remains of the bee-typed demon that was clinging onto him. Although it was a narrow escape from death, Kouki’s cheeks cramped as more demons swarmed him.



——I’ll be overwhelmed!



He was convinced. A voice that had no sense of panic was heard in Kouki’s ears.



[Don’t move, Amanogawa]



Immediately afterwards, countless meteors fell down upon the bee-typed demons and mercilessly trampled them.



Doo~opan! Doo~opan! Doo~opan! Doo~opan! Doo~opan!



You could only hear one gunshot but, the truth was that there were 6 flashes produced. *<- lol wut? the author only had 5 Doo~opan’s*



The shining red spear of light pierced through all demons in the line of fire and killed them instantly. In addition, the bullets were shot out with well-thought out trajectories, they went through the air and collided with the other bullets and with that slight change in angle they efficiently pierced through more Demons.



According to their viewpoint, it almost seemed as if the enemies voluntarily jumped into the bullets. Such special technique could be called an admirable performance, the demons which were giving Kouki a hard time were overwhelmed by Hajime, the bullets were continuously spinning and reloading one another, in addition Donner and Schlag shot out when they fell into confusion.



……It didn’t even take 1 minute before everything was taken care of. It was instant killings.



Hajime who annihilated the bee-typed demons in no time at all holstered Donner and Schlag as if nothing happened, he approached the defeated monsters as Kouki and them were stunned.



[Chi, it doesn’t seem like there’s any meaning even if I ate them…..]



[E, eat? Eh, Nagumo-kun, you intended to eat this? Seriously?]



Instinctively, Shizuku asked after being influenced by the previous act of devastation.



[Did I not say it before? …..If I eat a demon which is equal or higher than me, I can take in the opponents inherent magic for myself. In the abyss, the only thing there was to eat were demons. Ahh, you guys shouldn’t copy me. Without a doubt you’d die]



[Even if you didn’t say it, we wouldn’t. Hearing it once again is truly sublime…..]



Shizuku was looking at Hajime with a complex expression. He’s really reliable since he’s helped them countless times by now but, she was reminded once again of where that power came from was through a sublime experience, she was lost on whether she should honestly feel admiration or not.



[Bu, but, why aren’t you eating this thing then? No, as for Suzu, suzu doesn’t want to see such a predation scene so you don’t have to eat it but……]



[I just said it just now? There’s no meaning unless they’re equal or higher than me. The guys around here are all small frys]



[……I See~. For Nagumo-kun, this monster is a small fry~. I see~, ahaha]



[Suzu, I understand your feelings so don’t break. Please come back]



Suzu who was giving a dry laugh as if slightly broken and Shizuku was sighingly asking her to regain her sanity.



[……..]



Within that, only Kouki was staring at the remains of the demons that Hajime had created while tightly grasping the sword in his grip. For himself, the enemy was powerful to the extent where he had almost lost his life, but Hajime evaluated them as if they were just stones on the side of the road without any value, he felt unpleasant from their difference in ability. Although he was trying to pretend to not notice, dark emotions were beginning to swell up again within his heart.



Hajime glanced over at Kouki who was standing still silently.



[…….Amanogawa]



[~. Wh, what is it?]



[For now just think about finding your childhood friend. Being worried about this and that, it’ll be fine as long as you do what you have to do]



[Ah, ahh. You’re right, we have to quickly find Ryutaro and them….]



Although he stuttered somewhat, Kouki nodded firmly towards Hajime’s words. He braced himself again to search for his missing childhood friend.



After Hajime was glancing at Kouki like that, he seemed to have lost interest and averted his glance.



As a matter of fact, Hajime had clearly understood what Kouki was feeling. Inferiority complex and frustration, jealousy of strength……..they were emotions which Hajime had felt once before.



He never thought that Kouki who had everything would be feeling that way towards himself, it was a rather ironic subject. As Hajime was thinking about such things, because he had no feelings to consider for Kouki, he was simply through with it. The words from awhile ago that Hajime said out was already a big treat.



[Hajime-san, the other side was cleaned up~]



[Fu~u, this side is done too]



In the meantime, Kaori and Shia who finished dealing with the demons came back.



[Alright. Well then, shall we depart. I think that if its Yue and Teio then it’s alright but, we should still regroup with them as quickly as possible. Sakagami is……ma~a, whatever happens, happens]



[Wha-, aren’t you treating Ryutaro too crudely? Say, I know that your lover is important and all but….]



From what Hajime said, Shizuku had a troubled expression as she tsukkomied. The party advanced through the interior of the sea of trees to look for their companions who were separated from them.





Chapter 125




ZUDOOOOON! DOOGOOOON! GOOBAAA!



A roar shakes the ground in the sea of trees over and over, creatures which inhabit it were desperate to escape from the center of the explosion while panicking.



[Oraa! I’ll destroy this forest, get out of my way!]



Among the sounds that roared consistently, you could hear a scream.



It was Hajime’s voice.



Incidentally, it is Hajime who bombs the sea of trees in the present while scattering the roaring sound. A vein on his forehead is showing while he uses “Orkan” (TL: His rocket launcher) in both hands and randomly shooting rockets and missiles.



[A, Ano, Hajime-san, anymore is …..]



[That’s right, Hajime-kun, I’m sure that demon is already died, too and ….]



Without hiding his anger and frenzy, hundred of rockets and missiles were already shot by Hajime who keeps shooting cluster bombs with the “Cross Bits” from the sky in the forest, while Shia and Kaori fluster to restrain him.



However, ….



[Well, what?]



[Ie, it is nothing.]



[Un, I’m sorry to bother you.]



The two retracted their previous remarks immediately, because Hajime looked back with bloodshot eyes. (TL: He looked with blood lust.)



[Uu,…. scary. Shizushizu~ stop him.]



[Do not say the unreasonable, Suzu. I do not want to die yet. I think it’s also reasonable why he is angry…..]



Shizuku gives out a sigh while she’s calming Suzu who is clinging to her. She looks a little to the side. There was a crouching figure that was suppressing his own eyes with both hands while weeping.



[My eyes~, my eyes~, damn it, Nagumo! What are you doing so suddenly!]



A voice of agony is raised like a colonel from somewhere. It was the state of a person who got his eyes busted. Also, according to the words, Kouki’s eyes were pierced by Hajime who used his fingers like scissors.



So why is Hajime so mad that he burned the forest and crushed Kouki’s eyes?



After Hajime and the others fought a bee-shaped demon, they searched in the sea of trees for approximately 30 minutes. It was because of the encounter of a certain demon.



The demon was a monkey-type which attacked in crowds. The attacks flew from all angles freely by using the trees as a foothold and it was fairly troublesome. They were equipped with sword and clubs etc. Though it was unknown where they got these weapons.



Kouki, Shizuku and Suzu were fighting the monkey-demons and were played around with the tricky movements of them. Naturally, the monkey-demons were not Hajime’s enemy, as one would expect.



Hajime, who wanted to join with Yue as fast as possible, let Kouki’s group spar with the enemy to some degree.



Is it possible that the monkey-demon has some intelligence? The monkey-demons tried to take hostages. However, for Hajime, the thinking of that degree was too shallow. The monkey-demons that tried to take a hostage were all killed.



In those circumstances, the monkey-demons realized that they are no match and tried to withdraw, however…… it accidentally made the wrong choice. It was the worst decision they could have made.



The main cause is the peculiar magic of the monkey-demons – “Mimicry”. It is the same one as the one from the rust-colored Slime which made Hajime angry.



They also got the information of Yue’s group and it is possible for them to disguise themselves as the companions which Hajime’s group was separated from. However, unlike the rust-colored Slime, the monkey-demons were more intelligent.



In other words, it is possible for them to mimic actions which would disturb the others. They were able to think of that.



As a result, they used “Mimicry”. It was to be used against the most dangerous enemy with the person they value the most. It was the lowest method to shake them up.



The monkey-demons dragged their brethren that used mimicry from the back of the bush. Its appearance was that of Yue. The figure that was dragged along was badly bruised with an unladylike appearance. Because it is based on the information of the teleported team, the appearance is exactly the same as the real one. (TL: Yep. They dug their own graves now.)



Of course, Hajime was able to see through the mimicry of the rust-colored Slime before, so he obviously knew it was not Yue.



Still, even with Yue’s nudity and miserable appearance you can’t tell the difference between the fake a real thing. When closing in the distance with his “Instant Movement” (TL: Shukichi, Flicker, whatever was used before.), Kouki’s eyes, which almost looked at the “Mimicry”-Yue, were crushed.



At this point, though Hajime has already started losing his temper, it was still enough for his reason to work. However, the monkey-demons, despite their high intelligence, couldn’t read the mood. They hit the “Mimicry”-Yue in front of Hajime with a smile. In addition the “Mimicry”-demon was imitating Yue’s voice. […..Hajime, help me]. It became a serious matter because of that.



At that moment, everyone heard it. “BUCHI” was heard and something snapped. (TL: sound effects, think of it as a snapping sound)



And now, you can see a part of the sea of trees surrounded by flames of hell.



The scorched field which was 500 meters in every direction was already complete. If you look here and there you can see carbonized humanoids. In the wreckage, bee- and ant-demons were also seen.



Because it was an instant air strike, there will probably be not a demon that escaped unless some demons can make a space metastasis.



After Hajime burned everything in the sea of trees, he advanced while ignoring everything else.



[Don’t give up you both, please! Who else can stop Hajime-san other than Shia and Kaori!”



[But….]



[No buts. Why do you give up here? It ends when you give up! Hora, do your best! Hang in there! Dekiru, Dekiru! (2xYou can do it!) A maiden in love is invincible!]



The words from Shizuku, reminiscent of some coach, inspired Shia and Kaori. To be frank, Shizuku was desperate to make the two to go to Hajime as he was hard to approach now.



Without knowing the real intentions of Shizuku, Shia and Kaori nod to each other and jumped at Hajime while he was reloading “Orkan”.



[Hajime-san! Leave it at this!]



[That’s right, Hajime-kun. You may drag Yue’s group into it!]



He desperately glares at Shia and Kaori clinging to him. Hajime seems to be dissatisfied and utters a twisted expressions and raised his voice with an [A?, a?]



The appearance was, no matter how you look at it, one of a person that wanted to free his head. However, as he sees the two going [Ne?, Ne?], he regained his composure after a while.



[Fuuuuuu~~~~~ I understand. For now I’ll leave it at this. I feel refreshed after shooting.]



Hajome relaxed his shoulders and called back the “Cross Bits” and put them away along with “Orkan” into the “Treasure Box”. Shia and Kaori regained their composure and let out a relieved breath.



[My bad, I made you take care of me.]



[Ie, I also got mad at their methods. It was inevitable.]



[Un, really, it was the worst….. In a sense it was expected from the great labyrinth.]



When Hajime regained his composure he showed a wry smile, the two shaked his head while shaking their own heads in denial.



When Hajime was talking in the background of a part of the sea of tree that almost turned into wasteland, Shizuku stepped forward while having a cramp on her cheek.



[Naguno-kun, if you calmed down could you do something about Kouki ….]



With the words [Ah, Now that you mention it.] Hajime turns around to Kouki.



Kouki was shedding tears while sobbing. His appearance was indescribably pitiful. Kaori immediately used recovery magic when it was suggested by a glance.



[Uu, This feeling. Is it recovery magic? Oh, i can see light] (TL: Yes he sees light, maybe he should also see a tunnel and go into it?)



Kouki is liberated from the pain in his eyes and is looking joyfully. In addition, when Hajime who is the ringleader of the pain is spotted, he lifted his eyes and raises a voice of protest.



Shizuku explains the situation and the other party shows a dissatisfied face.



[You see, Amanogawa, though i am at fault, i couldn’t hold back. It was a critical moment of whether my lover’s improper appearance was seen by another man. A mans …. eyes should be crushed, don’t you agree?] (TL: Written Tennokawa, read as Amanogawa. This took me some time. Maybe i should write down their surnames or something….)



[What’s with that “common sense?”. Don’t demand for an agreement in that tone. I almost became blind. In the first place, how can you tell the fake apart? Setting aside the real thing, when i think about how i tasted the pain because of the impostor…… I’m really angry.]



[You are foolish. Comparing your eyesight with Yue’s half-nakedness….. is like putting a stone from the roadside with a high-class jewel on a scale.]



[My eyes aren’t roadside stones!]



Kouki objects to Hajime and shows resentment towards him, while Hajime wards of his remark, he goes back to his search.



While not taking notice of the other party, Kouki begins to get even more irritated. Shizuku and Suzu try to soothe the situation. In a certain meaning, they were indebted to a familiar girl. It was an unpleasant common point.



At that time Hajime caught a presence with his “Sign perception”. It will come at the speed of a small run.



Judging from the feeling of the sign, it seemed not to be a very powerful enemy. Therefore, Hajime looked back at the sea of trees with a doubtful look.



Shia also tilted her neck while gazing at the depths of the sea of trees.



Kouki also guessed that something approached them while looking at the manner of the two. It was a creature that resembled a goblin, while it made a rustling sounds (TL: “gasagasa” sounds). It had a dark skin with an ugly and distorted face, it wore a rag and was about 140 centimeters tall.



The goblin made a “Guga”-sound when it saw Hajimes appearance. Thought it cried with a somewhat excited voice, it movements stopped as it was startled by its own voice. It stopped and looked at Hajime. Because of its face, murderous intent was released.



In fact, it looked that way to Kouki.



Because he was not playing an active part in battle a feeling of irritation was felt by him and he made a rush to the goblin. He closed in the distance in the blink of an eye with his Holy Sword in hand.



However, the goblin which life was almost nearly cut, for a moment, it’s glance turned to Kouki, but it still did not show any behavior of taking a defensive action.



In an instant, even if Kouki had some doubts about it, he swung his Holy Sword down, because you couldn’t be careless against demons in the great labyrinth.



At that moment, when the Holy Sword cladded in light, almost cut the strange goblin in two,



[What are you doing, idiot!] (TL: “Boke~”, not “baka”)



[Nnabbubera?]



Hajime who caught up in a moment, kicked Kouki away with a “Rolling Savate”. A strange scream was raised and Kouki disappeared in the interior of the sea of trees, as if being run over by a dump truck.



Despite the demon before them, Shizuku was dumbfounded by the action of an ally getting blown away by a “Rolling Savate”. She couldn’t overlook the action, lifted her eyes in anger and rushed over to Hajime.



[Wait a moment, Nagumo-kun! What was that for!? No matter how you look at it, it was unreasonable. Kouki merely wanted to defeat the demon!]



[That’s right! Or rather, is Kouki-kun alright? We must go look for him immediately.]



Shizuku and Suzu turned a look of criticism to Hajime. Shia and Kaori also did not understand the reason for Hajime’s action.



However, Hajime did not hear their voices, he only gazed at the goblin in front of him.



In her eyes, Kouki was kicked away by Hajime’s “Rolling Savate” without reason and Shizuku put herself on guard against the existence of the goblin.



Kouki turned up from the back of the sea of trees while rubbing his arm. Apparently, he seemed to have been alright. However, it seemed he was going to jump at Hajime, while anger was omitting from his whole body.



[….. Nagumo. Why did you do that? Why did you get in my way? The situation is different from a while ago. Don’t make excuses. To protect a demon, are you sane?]



[It’s not a demon.]



[What did you say?]



Without reacting to Kouki’s anger and ignoring his muttering, he kneeled in front the still standing goblin. All members were astonished by the action and are doubting him more and more. Only Shia noticed something and muttered [No way….].



Hajime, who is meeting it’s eyes on the same level, says some words that startle the others.



[….. You are Yue, right?]



[Gugya!]



[[[….What the?]]]



While Kouki and the rest were standing there with open mouths, Hajime did not hesitate and took the goblins hand and muttered [Yue…]. The goblin, with a joyful cry, answered [Gugya.].



[Ehm, Hajime-san. I would never have imaged it would be Yue-san. Uhm, I can only see a demon….]



[I, I can only see a demon. Is it really Yue?]



Shia and Kaori raised a voice of doubt, while looking at the goblin in front of them. The goblin begins to cry out/complain to Hajime with [Gugya , Gugogo, Gyaagya], while looking at both of them. It shoulders dropped, because it is not able to talk with them.



However, Hajime is there. There is nothing impossible for the man who loves Yue.



[Yes?, Yes~ The next thing you knew is that your appearance changed after the transfer?]



[! Gugya ! …… Gugogo]



[Fumu, So it only changed the body……]



[Gugya …… Gyagya , Gugi]



[The equipment was also lost?….Oh, you came after the markings i have left?] (TL: Either equipment or accessories and “makingu” is written in “english”)



[Gugutsu …… Gogagoga]



[That’s right, Hajime is where the explosions come from? Well, you aren’t wrong……]



[……Gyuuu, Gogo]



[Is that so, you aren’t able to use magic…… But, you don’t feel any other changes.]



[Gigigi , Gagi]



[Well, it should be alright. It’s probably one of the trials. It was an inevitable start of the game]



[…… Gyuuu]



[And Tio and Sakagami weren’t with you. Perhaps the same happened with them as with Yue. I still don’t know anything about the demons here….. Well, Don’t worry about it Yue. I’ll do something about it as always.]



A normal conversation has been established. (TL: “normal”)



[[[[[ ………….. ]]]]]



Kouki and the rest were speechless. Hajime didn’t try to hide the fact that he was happy to be reunited with his lover and smiled.



[This kind of thing. Let’s try “Reproduction Magic” out.]



[[[[[ No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait ]]]]]



[Oh, What’s wrong?]



Kouki and the rest tsukkomied in a beautiful harmony and looked at Hajime with puzzled expressions. Everyone wanted to tsukkomi Hajime even more. Or rather, they weren’t able to hold out any longer.



[Isn’t it strange? It is strange, right? How can you communicate? Like nothing is going on!]



[Nothing is going on…. I talk because it is Yue?]



[Suzu only hears “Gugya”! No other words! How do you understand it?]



[No, with feelings… it is possible to talk with eyes.]



[Which reminds me, you always stare at each other……….It really is useful at such a time….. How the two of you communicate breaks through the center of the universe.]



[No, It’s normal for a lover.]



[It’s not normal? Obviously it is not normal…..What should we do. The “special” seat feels very far away.]



[Rather, Nagumo-kun. How did you notice it? Did you notice it before kicking me?]



[How did i, you know….. It’s a simple story.]



Many tsukkomis were made and the others had tired expressions because Hajime answered with his common sense. At the end, Kouki uttered a question towards Hajime, who looked peacefully at the goblin shaped Yue,



[It’s just that…. Her appearance may have changed, but i will never lose sight of Yue.]



[[[[[……Is that so?]]]]]



[…… Gugya]



With an expression that seemed like it was made of sugar, Yue (goblin Ver.) answered happily to Kouki’s group.



[Putting that aside. Kaori, I leave the “Reproduction Magic” to you.]



[Ah, Un, I understand……. Well then, here we go Yue: “Absolute Imitation”!]



Kaori, whose eyes slightly regained sanity, was appealed by Hajime, turned towards Yue (goblin Ver.) and used “Reproduction Magic”. Needless to say, reproduction magic is an age of gods magic and the effects are enormous. Hajime’s group thought it would return her to her old appearance if they used it……..



[Gugya?]



[What? Why? One more time: “Absolute Imitation”!]



Yue’s appearance did not change back.



It’s like the “Reproduction Magic” isn’t activating. A silver light pours down over Yue, but Kaori’s magic is erased with a crunching sound. There is still no sigh of Yue’s appearance turning back.



[Why……]



[Gugya……]



Kaori is stunned and Yue (goblin Ver.) dejectedly drops her shoulders. Even the other members had worried expressions. In the middle of it, Hajime folded his arms and hit the temple while brooding over the phenomenon.



Hajime wore a difficult expression. Yue (goblin Vers.), while gripping the bottom of his clothes, looked up to him with an uneasy expression. She though that it would be also difficult for her to turn someone back with “Reproduction Magic”.



To such a Yue (goblin Ver.), Hajime returned from his deep thoughts and turned a vibrant smile towards her.



[Everything is alright, Yue. I’ve said it before, we fell into the trap, but a Game Over is impossible at the start. There must be a method to turn you back. I believe the “Reproduction Magic” doesn’t work because the quality of the age of gods magic is different. A special method needs to be used. It is a self-evident truth, that the challengers of the trial have “Reproduction Magic”. There would be no meaning to the trial otherwise. In any case, we will find the method to turn you back if we proceed further.]



[…… Gugya]



[Aa, don’t worry about it. And, i forgot about this. Can you hold this?]



[…… Gigi?]



Hajime passed Yue (goblin Ver.) a pair of jewel earrings. Because she transformed and can’t use magic, he guessed that she needs something and gave her an artifact ?? “Telephatic Jewels”. (TL: actually stones, but they are earrings, so i choose “Jewels” instead of stones.)



[……Hajime?, Hajime? Can you hear me?]



Then, a lovely voice affected the space, the same way as Tio’s transformation into a dragon does. Hajime’s expression loosed up and he looked very happy while hearing a dear and nostalgic voice, even if it was only for a moment.



[Yeah, I can hear you, Yue. Your appearance changed….. but i’m glad you are alight.]



[……. Nn. I knew Hajime would notice it.]



[That’s natural. I’m the one who understands you the most.] (TL: Missed this line, i’m sorry~ Did not notice till now)



[……… Nn. But i was happy. I love you.]



[……Stop it. It’s embarrassing.]



[….. Fufu]



The air around them became sweet and pink, even though she was a goblin. Even if the appearance changed, they still create their own world. The eyes of the other members became like ones from dead fish.



[*Cough*! Isn’t it about time? Yue, I’m glad you are alright.]



[N…… Kaori, too]



[Yue-san……. Zettai, zee~~tai! We will turn you back! For that reason, you can rely on me!] (TL: “Zettai” means “absolutely” ,left it in japanese, because reasons…..)



[….. Shia, Thank you. I can’t fight now, so i’ll count on you.]



Shia and Kaori somehow regained their spirit and were able to exchange words with Yue.



[Yue-san, well, i’m sorry about a while ago. I didn’t notice it was you…. I almost injured you.]



[….Don’t worry. It was inevitable. And i believed i wouldn’t get injured….]



[Eeh, is it about me?]



[…. Even from the hero (lol), Hajime would protect me.]



[…… Is that so.]



Yue’s casual remark performs a clean hit. While withdrawing dejectedly, Kouki raised a dry laughter. Shizuku and Suzu try to encourage him.



[Well then, to change Yue back and find Tio and Sakagami we should push forward and quickly conquer the labyrinth.]



With Hajime’s command the party proceeded to advance in the sea of trees once again.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



[…..Hajime-san, even I see it. That is Tio.]



[I also understand it. No matter how you look at it, that is Tio.]



[….Rather, it would be a serious matter if it wasn’t Tio.]



[Unmistakable, That is Tio.]



Hajime and the others turn their eyes towards the filth they see.



After 30 minutes they joined up with Yue, they saw a group of goblins. The group assaulted one goblin with kicks and punches.



However, there was no intention of killing it and an atmosphere like bullying was there. The goblin seemed not to be injured while receiving an assault from the group.



If it was only that it was bullied because it was weak, it would be pretty natural……



[No matter how i see it….. It’s in ecstasy…..]



[Even though it has the face of a goblin….. We could never broadcast that.] [Nagumo….. You, to that kind of person…. I don’t feel like i could win it’s heart.] [Stop it, Amanogawa. I feel bad because i allowed that transformation…..I can only give up…..]



The goblin was floating in ecstasy, while the others where muttering. The appearance was reminiscent of a certain pervert. Or precisely, there could only be one such person.



[Tio… You are….. It’s too late already…. Let’s give up though it is regrettable.]



When Hajime shaked his head in a sad expression he quietly turned his back. Yue and the rest followed him without any hesitation. Normally, Kouki would say [Never desert a nakama!], among other things, but now his gaze is wandering. (TL: As in ignoring it and it is “nakama”, which can mean friend, companion, comrade..etc.)



[Gu? Gyagya!]



And, at that moment, the goblin noticed Hajime’s group and raised its voice.



As a result, the assaulted goblin seemed to notice Hajime. It opened its eyes wide and rushed towards Hajime, despite receiving an assault earlier.



The goblin (Tio) was crawling in a high-speed on the ground, while the other goblins instinctively pulled away and backed away. In fact, while the goblins tormented and bullied it in high spirit, they felt [Huh? Somehow you are strange.] and now they were convinced about it.



[Gugyagyagya!!]



Meanwhile, the goblin (Tio) tried to jump with a rupa?dive into Hajime’s chest. Though they can’t understand goblin words, seen that, it was surely [Master~ This one longed to see you] or something along those lines. (TL: Forgot to mention. It’s probably “scuba dive”, i don’t understand the censor of the author here so i left it~)



Of course, Hajime responded and said,



[Don’t come near me, you pervert!]



Mekyo!



And he used an uppercut with his artificial arm.



The goblin (Tio) made an artistic backflip with four and a half turns, but did make a sound like it should have been. She crashed.



[…..Dead?]



Yue (goblin Ver.) peeked into the bush where the body of the goblin (Tio) fell. It’s tail was pierced by a tree branch.



Then, [Bikunbikun]! The body of the goblin (Tio) was twitching, while regaining consciousness. Though the body is that of a goblin, the endurance may be that of a dragon. Or, she became an even bigger pervert……



[GaGaGa! GoGo, Guge! Guga!]



The goblin (Tio) held her cheeks with both hands and screamed excited, while her body twisted around. And then, she began looking at Hajime with feverish eyes.



Instinctively, Hajime starts pulling out “Donner” and Shia desperately tries to calm him. Kaori handed over a “Telepathic Stone” over to the goblin (Tio).



[Uh-huh, a “Telepathic Stone”….. Do thou hear me, Master? This one met the beloved Master and the first words and actions were those of abuse.]



[Damn it. Even if the body changes, the toughness does not. It should just die already.]



[Tsu! Aah? Beloved Master. The lack of pardon, this one can’t hold out. Mistress is useless without Master. Now, Master’s beloved servant has returned. It’s good how the mistress, who is reduced to ugliness, is attacked without restraint!]



Apparently, even if she changed into a goblin, she still felt the pleasure. It was already too late as Hajime said.



The goblins, while ignoring Tio who is lying on the ground saying [Do as you like! Burn or boil me!] and still twitching, were insta-killed by Hajime. And the search was resumed in silence.



The other members also did not seem to care about it and follow Hajime without turning their eyes.



[Ho, is this neglect play? Master can’t be helped~ Ey, don’t leave this one behind!? This one wants you to wait~ This one is still shaking because of the blow a while ago~]



Tio’s voices echoes empty in the sea of trees. However, nobody stopped walking.



(TL: I used “it” rather than really translating it to english because i guess it makes more sense calling her an “object” rather than a “person”.)



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The huge branch bends and attacks irregularly like a whip. Leaves dance like a blade and scatter around. Tree nuts are shot like cannonballs. A sudden spear-like root dashes out from the ground like the sharp point of a sword. Each of these attacks are fatal.



It is very similar to the Tree-Demon Hajime once fought in the [Orcus great Labyrinth]. The demon is a so-called “Trent”. But then, when Hajime compared this Trent with the one he fought, the size is extremely different. It was 30 meters high and 10 meters in diameter.



Kouki, Shizuku, Suzu and the ogre-like creature are confronting the huge Trent.



[Guraaa!]



Meanwhile, while raising a shout like a real Ogre, it is Ryutaro who attacks with his fist to intercept the branches that come in.



Along the way, an Ogre was discovered fighting other Ogres. However, while the fight went on martial arts were seen – To be frank, it made refined karatemovements. It was obvious that it was Ryutaro.



Ryutaro might have been dead if they found him later as his status has fallen as Yue’s and Tio’s did. To go that far without running away, a tsukkomi was made about his muscle-brain.



And, Ryutaro finally joined with them as the last member. They reached the place with the gigantic tree which was obviously on a different size compared with the surrounding ones…… The gigantic tree said [Defeat me if you want to go further!] and began to rage as it said it.



At the present time, Kouki’s group which did not show any results till now said [We will defeat this guy!] and rushed out. Hajime’s group didn’t care and started to spectate the fight. By the way, Kaori is participating as a healer.



[Gwuuuu. The attack is heavy.]



A branch with the thickness of a log approaches, while cutting through the wind, and is received by Kouki with his Holy Sword. However, a groan leaked from the space of gritted teeth, while reminding how excessive the weight of the attack was.



Shizuku is busy with shuriken like leaves, which fly like throwing knifes. Suzu puts up a powerful barrier to somehow intercept the attack and Kouki desperately decides to use the opening to attack.



[Kuu, No good. Because Kaori is here, we do not have to worry about not being able to continue……]



The black katana “Tsumehirameki” was fully taken advantage of. Shizuku gridded her teeth while cutting branches and leaves one by one. (TL: Not sure ??, something like claw flash/lighting)



Hajime’s words before entering the great labyrinth, sank into the bodies of Shizuku’s group. Without Hajime they would have been annihilated already. The confidence they gained in the [Orcus great Labyrinth] was crushed into pieces.



After worrying a little, Shizuku shouted towards Kouki.



[Kouki! Use “Supreme Destruction”!] (TL: ?? not too sure, used chapter 122 as a reference )



[No, it’s not good. The chant is too long!]



[It’s alright! We will defend you without fail! Believe in us!]



Kouki was troubled what he should do about Shizuku’s suggestion.



It was obvious that the Trent before them was stronger than the demons of the woman of the Majin-tribe (TL: Demon-tribe). The attacks only come one by one, however the fight is only somewhat manageable with Kaori’s backup. They could lose their lives if they lose concentration even once. It would take more than an average nerve to expose oneself defenseless in such a time.



However, it was certain that without an overwhelming attack they can’t reach the Trent. At this rate, they wouldn’t be able to defeat it.



In addition……



Kouki recalls the time when Hajime met Yue again. A mutual trust that did not change, even when the appearance changed. Hajime saw the true nature of his lover in an instant and Yue did not show any unrest while she was almost killed by Kouki. Honestly, it would be a lie so say that he did not envy such a relationship.



Therefore, Kouki was determined. We have a relationship of mutual trust. It was absolutely not to prove that they will not lose to Hajime.



[I understand. I leave my back to you!]



[Yes, leave it to us. Ryutaro, Suzu! Let’s gather up!]



[Roger!]



[Aye yo!]



Kouki did not move an inch while raising his Holy Sword over his head. Only his mouth moved while chanting. That state may be called defenseless, because his whole consciousness was poured into the chant of “Might of Heaven”.



The Trent was sure not to miss that chance. The tree branches from right and left, a leaf blade which approached like a tornado from above, a shell of nuts from the front and the root of a tree attacks from the ground.



[This is sacred ground, the enemy of god will not be allowed to pass! “Absolute Virtue!”] (TL: “??” not sure about this skill, also “YOU SHALL NOT PASS!” would also work, but i did not want to use a sketchy line~)



Suzu foresaw an attack and put up a barrier. Up till now her barriers have saved the party. The barrier withstood somehow the first barrage of attacks with small cracks.



[Tsuuuuu!]



Because of the consecutive attacks of the Trent, the barrier couldn’t hold out and breaks. Suzu’s groan resounds loudly, while Shizuku and Ryutaro (Ogre Ver.) are attacking in despair.



[Tsuuuaaa!]



[Ooooooh!]



They were badly bruised in an instant because of the offensive waves of attacks. They intercept every attack with their skills, while screaming and roaring. Though two people get damaged and blood spilled out, they didn’t let any attack pass to the back.



[“Kaiten!”] (TL: Changing the world or turning the tide. Japanese sounds a bit better.)



With only one world echoing on the battlefield, Suzu’s wounds are healed in an instant by Kaori’s magic.



Though “Kaiten” is a recovery magic for multiple targets, it’s effects are already above the advanced level. Most wounds are healed in no time. After getting Nointo’s body, Kaori was inspired to create new healing magic. It was possible to heal with “Regeneration Magic”, however the magic consumption from the age of gods magic is larger than normal magic.



Suzu puts up a barrier again and earns a few seconds, however it gets destroyed again. Shizuku and Ryutaro put their lives on the line again. Kaori immediately heals their damaged bodies and Suzu puts up another barrier. They repeat this three times.



Finally, from Kouki’s body, a huge amount of magic gushes out and covers his Holy Sword. The Holy Sword is cladded in light like the sun and Kouki takes a deep breath.



And,



[????Everyone! Here i go! “Supreme Destruction” !!]



He unleashes his trump card, his strongest magic. A huge torrent of light strikes the ground and flies forward. A leaf blade is blown off, the tree branch gets eliminated, the bombardment of the nuts is swallowed and the Trent is hit directly.



The roaring sounds and light explode, while the surroundings are dyed white.



[I did it!]



Kouki gives a smile of satisfaction and shouts. Hajime watches in the back, while stuffing a small cake into his mouth, and mutters [Aah, he raised the flag…..].



The flag was certainly raised.



The light and dust clears up……and the Trent is unhurt.



[It’s a lie, right……]



Kouki is stunned and makes a lifeless voice. It wasn’t only Kouki. Shizuku’s group also were shocked because Kouki’s last resort was useless.



The Trent lets out murderous intent towards Kouki’s group and starts attacking in waves again.





Chapter 126




“Supreme Destruction” ???? Is a power like the name says. A power worthy as a hero’s trump card, a magic of the highest grade. Kouki came as a beginner into this world, leveled up, gained experience and was able to slaughter all enemies with his special technique.



However, the Trent emerged unscathed from the dust.



[Impossible…..]



Kouki was unable to move because of that fact. Shizuku realized something and raises her voice.



[Kouki! Look at that! It wasn’t a direct hit!]



[Eh?]



When Kouki looked into the same direction as Shizuku, he saw a large amount of trees scattered around, broken into small fragments. Apparently, Kouki’s “Supreme Destruction” did not hit the Trent directly. It was prevented by a large amount of trees in the front.



Though there shouldn’t be any trees there? Where on earth did such a great amount appear from? The questions from Kouki’s group were answered by the Trent.



At that time, the Pseudo-Trent gave out a pale light. A large number of trees spread out from the base and grew in a very great force.



[…… Unique Magic.]



Suzu muttered. That opinion was right. It was the unique magic of the Trent of the “Sea of Trees”. It was freely able to create a large amount of trees and manipulate them freely.



[This, this is bad! This is sacred ground, the enemy of god will not be allowed to pass! “Absolute Virtue!”]



Suzu was momentarily dumbfounded, but was able to invoke “Absolute Virtue” immediately. Attacks poured in from all directions, while a shining barrier was deployed with Suzu’s group inside.



The branches which had a sharpened point like a spear gave an intense shock to the barrier one after another.



Not only the Trent, but also the surrounding trees also produced a similar attack. It seemed they wold get crushed to death by the almost oppressive amount of resources.



The “Absolute Virtue” won’t be able to hold out without a chant. It already cracked here and there, it did not seem to hold out for another several seconds. And, when Suzu’s barrier gets broken, will the others hold out till she deploys it again?…..Only an optimist would judge it doable.



[No good….anymore….]



Suzu realizes by the magic consumption, that the barrier will soon break and informs the others.



Kouki looks at Suzu. [Then i have to use “Limit Break” to survive!] He made his resolve. There is no choice but to accept that they need to use two of their trump cards directly at the first stage after entering a great labyrinth.



However, after guessing Kouki’s intentions, assistance came from the rear.



[“Forever Engraved”]



The reproduction magic “Forever Engraved”, which Kaori used – regardless of the substance of the object – can regenerate everything to the state one second ago every one second it is used.



Suzu’s “Absolute Virtue” which seemed to break at any moment, gets surrounded by a silver light. After one beat, the barrier recovered to its dignified appearance af if nothing happened. Even after the attacks of the Trents , it returns to its original state. “Absolute Virtue” is repaired every second.



[Wow, Kao-rin! Thank you!]



Suzu, while maintaining the barrier, looks back and thanks Kaori. Kouki and the others slighty relax their bodies because they got of the predicament and look to the back.



There, the Trents surrounded Hajime’s group like it did to Kouki’s. Hajime and the others did not seem to care about it.



Four “Cross Bitts” were arranged by Hajime in the surroundings and a triangular pyramid was spread as a barrier. (TL: Like this: http://www.math-salamanders.com/images/lgs-3d-shape-triangular-based-pyramid.gif) The space interception type produce a spatial magic “Four-Point Barrier”.



“Reproduction Magic” isn’t even used and still there are no signs that the barrier gets shaken. It seems to be a totally impregnable castle wall, without allowing any attack to come near.



[That seems to be the limit. I thought they would hold out longer…..]



Hajime murmured while looking down at Kouku who had a complicated look.



[U~n, Wouldn’t they be fine if the hero-san uses his “Limit Break”?]



[I wonder. Well, if he goes over his limit maybe…… However, what will happen after he weakens after that? It is unlikely that he can recover from the fatigue of his “Limit Break” with healing magic.]



[…..It may be possible with Reproduction Magic.]



[I don’t want to use it as the magic consumption is big. It’s still too early for that.]



[Fumu. Well then, we should clear up here before the hero-boy uses it.]



Hajime was wondering if Kouki and the others would be acknowledged to have cleared the great labyrinth. Kouki and the others should obtain the age of gods magic , because [If Nointos appear in a great amount we could use the “throw the heroes at them”-strategy.]



So, they should raise their military strength in the great labyrinth [Appeal with: “We should fight hard!” ] Or so he wished…….



Because it is unknown what may happen beyond this point, it’s not preferable to use age of gods magic in succession because of its magic consumption. Even though they have magic stones stocked up, they don’t know when Yue and Tio can turn back and are able to fight.



[Master, this one thinks you should not worry too much about the outcome of the battle.]



[Yes? What do you mean? Is it about the concept of the great labyrinth?]



The goblin (Tio) advises Hajime who thinks deeply about the current situation. Despite her being a pervert, her words and knowledge are very thoughtful. Though, she is still a helpless pervert.



[Yes. The concept is probably “testing the bonds”.]



[Bond….. Speaking of it, the word was also on the stone tablet at the entrance.]



[That’s right. Not only to test the bonds with the sub-humans, but also to test the bonds when capturing the labyrinth. Is it not so? See through the imitations, accept the companions which changed. It is truly testing the “deep woven bonds”.]



[I see….. If there is a goal after clearing this trial you could call this a “guidepost”. If it’s that way, then there might be no problem if I clean up the battle. Amanokawa and the others only need to get over the “testing the bonds something” what comes after this.]



[That’s right. Well, it is only a guess in the end.]



It is still a very reliable guess.



With understanding that, Hajime makes his decision and lets out a sigh. Even though he strengthened Kouki and other with the artifacts greatly, the great labyrinth reads the memory after the capture and there is a possibility it won’t accept them if he makes them too strong and so he waited.



Hajime glanced at the Goblin (Tio) and lets out another sigh. Tio occasionally gives sharp consideration and makes suggestive advice because she lived far longer than him. He’s reminiscent that the race is supposed to be noble and respectful.



Originally she is thoughtful and considerate and has the perfect nature of the Dragon-Race which Yue longed for. Every man would be captured by her beauty as she’s a very attractive lady.



Even though she’s already a pervert…..



[Really, is it my fault?] Hajime worried in his mind. And he looks at the Goblin (Tio) and regretted it.



[Mu? Master’s look of pity at this one….haa, haa, this is in itself….. already…Mistress is no good without Master.]



[Haa~]



Tios wriggling with her Goblin body gave out unpleasant feelings.



Hajime looks at the Trent which attacks without restraint but still can’t tear Suzu’s “Absolute Virtue” and Hajime’s “4-Point-Barrier”. In addition it still generates more trees. The surrounding view was already filled with trees.



[Taniguchi. I’ll burn everything now. Don’t undo the barrier if you don’t want to die.]



[Eh?]



Hajime warns Suzu before unleashing an attack while she is defending from attacks from all directions.



Suzu suddenly answers dumbfounded with a great voice. Kouki and the other turn dubious expressions towards Suzu. The expressions will soon turn into dumbfounded ones.



Outside of the barrier, Hajime throws a moonlike-ring (Getsurin) into the air and takes out a remote control with an induction stone out of the “Treasure Box”. With the power of “Wind Claw” and “Sign Perception” the surrounding trees were easily dissected and thrown into the air. (TL: Actually the author has written “sky”, but i choose to change it to “air”. Makes somehow more sense. I’ll use “Getsurin” from now on, just needed to explain what it is.)



The numbers exceeded 20. It’s impossible to make them get battle mobility, but it’s easy to change the tide.



And in the next moment, black liquid scatters around the Trent like raid because of the Getsurin. The black liquid scattered around is a tar that burns at 3.000? which even melts Fullum ore.



Hajime transfers a large amount of tar stored in the “Treasure Box” by using the gate function of Getsurin.



While trying to figure out what Hajime was doing, Shia and the other let out a [Uwaa~] and their eyes turned towards Hajime.



Certainly, it was effective to deal with the Trent and all the trees it quickly generated……..



While the girls gazed at Hajime, he threw a small live coal towards Getsurin.



In that moment,



Gooooooooo !! (TL: Not sure how to translate sound effects ????????!!)



Everything in sight was dyed instantly in flaming red.



The Trents, which didn’t even worry when the tar was released, are now surrounded by a prison of flames of 3,000? and instantaneously burned by it. Though they don’t have vocal cords, it seems they are screaming in agony.



The spectacle may be mistaken for hell which has manifested on this world. Now, every object outside of the barrier is certainly carbonized……No, even cinders might not remain.



The tar does not burn for long, but the heat is terrific. The hellfire produced by Hajime extinguished naturally after 15 minutes. However, because the Trents ran wild, it even spread to normal trees, so Kaori managed somehow to extinguish the flames with water magic.



[We joined up with Yue and the other already, so i had no problems burning everything down….]



[Hajime-kun…. Do you even think before destroying everything?]



[Where Hajime-san is, there is also destruction…. Father and the others might think of two new names if they see it.]



[……Hajime not restraining himself….Wonderful.]



[This one agrees, Yue. Merciless Master…. This one gets wet.]



Hajime releases the “4-Point-Barrier” and walks toward Kouki and the others who have somewhat tired expressions, while Kaori turns to Hajime looking troubled. The members other than Kaori are saying [That’s very Hajime-like.] and [As expected from Hajime.]. With satisfaction on her face she nods in agreement.



[Nagumo-kun….A little while ago…. No, it’s nothing. A rocket launcher has already been fired at random and cluster bombs were scattered around. This much is already normal for him. Therefore, get a grip, myself……]



Kouki and the others made a complicated look, as if they are really safe. At the same time, Kouki glanced towards Hajime and bits his lips tightly.



Kouki wasn’t able to knock it down even with his last resort and Hajime did it as if it was a side-job. Even if he was persuaded to come here to obtain the age of gods magic, will he really obtain it while being helped……? Such uneasiness was welling up in his mind.



Kouki averts his glance from Hajime and tries to shake off his negative thoughts and looked back in panic as he heard “Mekimeki”-sounds from behind.



[Did it regenerate?]
