Volume 4 Chapter 8


Regin Banton was a strong man, rumored to be the next Chief of the Banton tribe; one of the Bearman tribes. He idolized one of the current Elders; Jin Banton, and became his right hand.

Not only Regin, it could be said Jin was popular in the Banton tribe as a whole, especially the younger ones. The reasons for that being Jin’s character was broad minded, containing deep patriotism, and above all, his strength, which allowed him to be considered as one of the highest class among the demi-human race.

That’s why, when the Bearman tribe heard the news, they thought it was a bad joke. They couldn’t believe their beloved Elder had been incapacitated by a human. However, the merciless reality was proven. Jin, who was lying powerless in medical facility showed them the truth .

Regin was dumbfounded having seen Jin’s current appearance. Next, his anger and hatred surfaced. While bearing these feelings inside his heart, he pressed to determine the circumstances from the Elders. As the result, Regin who had learned everything, disregarded the Elders and told the Bearman tribe everything. And thus they embarked for revenge.

Because of the persuasion from the Elders and other tribes, not all of the Bearman tribe followed him, only the youngsters from Banton tribe who admired Jin had left to defeat that hated human. They numbered around 50 people. Regin and the others who knew their enemy’s objective thought it best to attack when their enemy was in front of the Great Tree as revenge. They thought, “To perish right before the goal is the best (revenge)”.

After all, their enemies only consists of humans and the RabbitMan tribe. Even though Jin was defeated, they thought it was because something cowardly, like a surprise attack. They thought there was nothing to fear of humans who would go mad without a sense of direction deep inside the Sea of Trees’ fog, even more so for the weak RabbitMan tribe. Regin was an outstanding person. Normally, he wouldn’t interpret the situation like that. However, currently his eyes were clouded by anger.

However, no matter what, even if his eyes were clouded…

“This is wrong!?”

Regin screamed in disbelief. The reason; before his very eyes an impossible spectacle was displayed. The RabbitMan tribe, which was placed at the bottom among other demi-humans, was cornering the Bearman tribe, which was known as one of the strongest in combat.

“Come on come on come on! Show your fighting spirit! Or else, I will cut you!”

“AHAHAHAHAHA, scream like the pig you are!”

“It’s time to clean this filth! HYAHAHAHAHA HA!”

While the Haulia tribe swung countless fatal, murderous attacks, their loud laughter resounded. There was no appearance of the RabbitMan tribe which was gentle, peaceful, and above all, weak in combat. Screams came from the Bearman tribe that desperately try to fight back.

“Shit! The heck is this! Just who the hell are you!!”

“They must not be the RabbitMan tribe!”

“Uwaaaa! Stay away! Stay awaaaay!”

They were ambushed by the enemies they wanted to ambush, the RabbitMan tribe that laid in ambush showed unbelievable power, even among other demi-human races. Arrows and stones that fly accurately out of nowhere, added to their excellent teamwork. The glee with which they swung their blades, wearing lunatic expressions, and laughing loudly all the while! All of it gave birth to violent commotion. In that situation, their specs even exceed the Bearman tribe.

Actually, the RabbitMan tribe wouldn’t be able to compete in a one on one fight against the Bearman tribe. However, in these past ten days, the Haulia tribe was able to make up the difference, thanks to the hell-like training.

Originally, the RabbitMan tribe’s specs were lower than the other demi-human races. However, to survive and avoid battle, they had polished their stealth ability and danger perception. After all, they could only survive that way.

As a result, they were able to promptly perceive their enemies’ presences to the point they could ambush their enemies. It could be said that they are a race with abilities suited for assassination. However, their innate nature had crushed these advantages.

It could be said, Hajime’s training woke their combat instincts. He single-handedly abused and cornered them by letting them swing weapons, cut their enemies, and letting them experience how to evade, without rest. By remembering the speech from senior sergeant Hart**n, as a result of ten days of severe training, their minds completely became combat oriented. Although he did feel like it was too much…

They, who had acquired the aggressiveness to attack without any hesitation, demonstrated promising combat prowess. Because they thought of the whole tribe as members of one family, their level of teamwork was high from the get go. With their skillful adjustment of presence, it demonstrated tremendous effect, along with their teamwork.

In addition, one of the reasons for the Haulia tribe’s high combat prowess was the weapons made by Hajime, which increased their incompetent attack power.

Each of them wielded two Kodachis, produced with a precise and practiced process, such that their ultra-thin blades were able to split a grass just by touching it. They were made of Taur ore, so they were durable. The Haulia tribe also carried disposable throwing knives.

There were also the powerful Slingshots and Crossbows that were made using string with great elasticity gathered from spider-like demonic beasts in the Abyss. They were made for the children of the Haulia tribe, since close range battles were still too hard for them. Even children are able to shoot enemies from the other side of fog, using their search ability while they instinctively looked up to Hajime.

Even Pal… … Baltoferd of Certain Death, was completely charmed when shooting his Crossbow, while showing a sniper-like nature.

“One shot of certain death! ‘DO’ your was head blown off. In the name of “Certain Death””

Pal… .. Baltoferd of Certain Death recently gained the habit of saying such things. By the way, he called himself “Certain Death”. His first habitual saying was “Aim and Shoot!” but it was stopped by Hajime. He looked so displeased.

Back on topic, the Bearman tribe who fell into a panic were easily defeated without much resistance by the current Haulia tribe and their numbers fell in no time. Currently half of them had been killed in the vicinity.

“Regin-dono! If this keeps up-”

“Retreat!”

“Let me take care of the re-KUPE!?”

“Tontoo!?”

Having heard his subordinate advise him to retreat, Regin was hesitating because of anger from the incapacitated Jin and his killed subordinates. That hesitation wasn’t missed by the Haulia’s sniper. To the subordinate called Tonto that tried to advise his lord to retreat once again, an arrow accurately penetrated his temple.

Because of this Regin and his subordinates were shaken and fell into disorder. Kam and the others who thought it was a chance, attacked at once.

Arrows came flying from the fog and accurately aimed at their ankles. While distracted by that, a sharp attack came to reap the head. With an exquisite timing, the person who wanted to kill the one that shot arrows from the back ran into protruding spikes.

However, perhaps it was because that was their favorite move, a presence suddenly came from behind, and brought with it a fatal blow. Haulia tribe utilized their presence and teamwork to make fun of Regin and his subordinates. Regin and his subordinates shuddered at this. They thought, “Are they really that hetare and weak RabbitMan tribe!?”

The battle dragged on for a while, Regin and his subordinates were finally able to recover from their confusion while covered in wounds. They were somehow able to stand using their weapons as support. When the waves of attacks using the exquisite covering fire and teamwork subsided, all of them were panting. Regin and his subordinates were surrounded by Kam and the others, after being cornered with a gigantic tree to their backs.

“What happened, you “bleep”?! Is that all?! Wuss!”

“I heard you were the strongest tribe! You “bleep”! Even so you were “bleep”!

“Poise your weapons quickly! Are you “bleep”‘s already weak in the knees?!”

They thought it was not the RabbitMan tribe, with how they bombarded the other tribe with insults. The Bearman tribe which trembled in fear could only think, “What had happened to these guys!?” With broken spirits, some of them trembled while holding their heads. A big hairy man said, “Can you let us go?” with teary eyes… … truly a surreal spectacle.

“KU KU KU, did you have anything else to say? O strongest tribe?”

Kam let out that sarcasm with a truly evil expression. They who had awoken to their fighting spirit seemed to have thought about their circumstances when they were looked down upon. It was a speech that couldn’t be heard from the Kam of the past.

“Nuguu…”

Having heard Kam’s objection, Regin’s expression distorted in regret. He somehow recovered from the confusion and reasoning came back to his eyes. Even though he had been doused with cold water by Haulia tribe’s strong assault, because of the incapacitated Jin, the flame of anger still burnt inside of him. But, because he felt a sense of responsibility to bring his surviving subordinates back alive, he regained his mind. He consciously knew it was his fault that they fell into such a predicament because he was the one that spurred them on.

“… … you can do anything to me. Boil me or burn me, just do whatever you like. However, I was the one who forcibly brought my subordinates. I want you to let them go”

“Wh-, Regin-dono!?”

“Regin-dono! That was…”

Having heard Regin’s words, his subordinates started to make a commotion. It was because he tried to save his subordinates in exchange for his own life. To these subordinates, Regin scolded.

“Silence! … … it was my responsibility because of the blood that surged to my head clouded my eyes. RabbitMan… … no, Chief of Haulia tribe. I know it is selfish of me. However, I want to save their lives! That’s all.”

Regin released his weapon then started to kneel while bowing his head. His subordinates knew of Regin’s great pride as a warrior, so they understood how much resolution he had to bow his head to the enemy. That’s why they couldn’t obey his order to stay silent.

Kam’s answer to Regin who was still bowing was…

“I refuse”

While throwing his knife.

“Uo!?”

Regin was able to dodge by a hairs-breadth. However, starting with Kam’s attack, Regin and his subordinates were attacked from the surrounding with arrows and stones fired at high velocity, at once. Using their big axes as shields, Regin and subordinates desperately tried to defend themselves, and then from the Haulia tribe came laughter from the bottom of their heart, completing their attacks.

“Why!?”

Regin squeezed a voice as he groaned to ask them for the reason they attacked.

“Why? Aren’t you our enemies? Are other reasons necessary to kill you?”

Kam’s answer was a simple fact.

“Guh, but!”

“Above all… .. it’s enjoyable to crush and make fun of your arrogance! HA HA HA!”

“W-Wh-!? Bastards! To these guys-!”

Just as Kam said, Haulia tribe looked like they truly enjoyed it. Using Slingshots and Crossbows, they made fun of them by shooting from a safe area. Their appearances were those of people drunk on power. It looks like their heart’s didn’t mind killing people for the first time, even if it was their demi-human brethren. In short, they’ve become completely berserk.

With increasing severity in their attacks, Regin and his subordinates who had stayed close together, and desperately tried to defend were… … finally reaching their limit. Although they avoided fatal attacks, they were covered in wounds. They won’t be able to endure the next volley.

Kam, with a warped grin, ‘sutto’ raise his hand. Haulia tribe with frenzied eyes start to aim with arrows and stones at the ready. Regin who thought this wasn’t an appropriate place to die, gathered his power, and inside his mind he apologized to his subordinates.

Kam’s hand, like a death god’s scythe that hunted the lives of Regin and his subordinates, was lowered. Arrows and stones immediately shot. In slow motion, Regin continued to watch this without looking away, until…

“Stop it already!!!”

Zudooooon!!

A spectacle where a white hammer blew everything away could be seen.

“Ha?”

Regin who was dumbfounded by it unintentionally let out that voice. However, that can’t be helped. Immediately after they accepted their death, a rabbit-eared girl with pallid hair along with a giant hammer fell from the sky, then the hammer struck the ground. It resulted in the shockwave that blew away all the incoming arrows and stones. When they saw that, the surrounding Bearman tribe could only give a blank stare.

Shaking anger! That was the feeling that could be felt, of course it came from Shia. The Sledgehammer made using the compression method had extraordinary mass. As if she didn’t feel the weight, it was brandished with a ‘Buonn’ then generated a gust. ‘Bishi’ it was pointed toward Kam.

“Aghh! Seriously arghh! Father and everyone, please come to your sense already!”

Looking at Shia, Kam and the others who were initially stunned in astonishment, with ‘ha’ regained themselves while look toward her blaming.

“Shia, though I don’t know why you did this, but please move from there. Or else we won’t be able to kill the ones behind you, you know?”

“No, I won’t move. I won’t allow anymore than this!”

Having heard Shia’s words, Kam and the others narrowed their eyes.

“Won’t allow? Shia, don’t tell me you wanted to be together with our enemy? According to your answer…”

“No, I don’t care if these guys died”

“””” Is that okay!? “”””

The Bearman tribe that thought she came to stop her tribe, unintentionally let out a remark to Shia.

“Of course. If I took it easy against enemies that came with killing intent, I wouldn’t be able to endure Yue-san’s training. Even I don’t have that naive thought anymore”

“Fumu, then why did you stop us”

Kam asked her. Haulia tribe also have inquiring expressions.

“Isn’t that obvious! Father and the others will be broken at this rate! And become more degenerated!”

“Broken? Degenerate?”

Having heard Shia’s word, Kam and the others can only put ‘I don’t understand” expressions.

“That’s right! Please remember it. Hajime-san was merciless against enemies, no talking was necessary, even more merciless, he enjoyed killing demonic beasts and people (…) things like that! Even during training, if you were told to kill the enemies, you shouldn’t have enjoyed it!”

“W-well, it’s not like we enjoy…”

“Just now, did father and the others know what kind of faces you made?

“Face? Well, even if you said that…”

Having heard Shia’s words, the Haulia tribe started to look at each others faces. Shia let out a calm breath, however, her voice clearly informed them.

“… … it was just like those Empire’s Soldiers that attacked us”

“Kh!?”

It shocked them, enough to blow off their frenzy. Their mood was as if they were doused with cold water. To have the same expressions as those who scorned their family with pleasure and caught them… … having actually witnessed that they understood the ugliness of their action. To be the same as those who snacthed their family away… … was an unbearable fact.

“Sh-Shia… I was…”

“Fuu, it looks like you have calmed down. Thank god. At worst, I thought I might have to beat you all down”

With ‘furifuri’, Shia swung the Sledgehammer around. Having heard Shia point that out, immediately Haulia tribe was trembling in front of the Sledgehammer while Shia loosened her cheeks a little.

“Well, it was your first battle, if you realized that now then it’ll be okay! It was Hajime-san’s fault after all! Although I understand the importance of fighting spirit, that was too much! Rather than fighting spirit, it was more like you became berserkers!”

This time, Shia was ‘puripuri’ angry at Hajime. A small voice of Shia muttering can be heard, “Just why did I fall for that kind of person”.

And at that time, a gunshot can be heard.

From Shia’s back, “Guwa!?” a groan could be heard, along with sound of something collapsing. Now that they think about it, while in a panic Shia and the others remember the existences that they’d forgotten about, then looked behind their back, there laid Regin who writhed in pain while holding his forehead.

“Why the heck are you trying to run away while their attention was diverted? Until their talk is over sit in seiza now!”

Hajime accompanied by Yue appeared from inside the fog. It seems while Shia and the others were immersed in their talk, Regin and his subordinates tried to run away, only to get shot. However, it wasn’t known why he used the non-lethal rubber bullet.

Although they heard Hajime’s words, the Bearman tribe tried to vigilantly examine their surroundings to keep running away, but Hajime silenced them with “Pressure”. While casting glances at them, Hajime and Yue looked at Shia and the others.

When Hajime saw Kam and the others, some of them felt awkward and looked the other way. However, immediately after words of apology came to Kam and the others.

“A, well, what to say, sorry. Because I was fine with it, I’d completely forgotten the shock of murder. It was my mistake. Un, I am sorry”

Shia and the others can only ‘pokan’ blankly stare at him with opened mouths. That was because they heard an unexpected but honest apology.

“Bo-boss!? Are you okay!? Did you hit your head!?”

“Medic! Medic! There is a person with serious injury here!”

“Boss! Please steady yourself!”

That’s why it became such reactions. With veins popping on his head, his mouth twitched.

This time, Hajime himself truly thought it was his mistake. Because he didn’t feel anything when he kills, he didn’t consider the shock that was supposed to occur with it. No matter how much stronger he had become, he didn’t have any experience in teaching, as a result, he almost broke the Haulia tribe’s minds. Indeed, he thought it was dangerous, that’s why he said those words of apology… … but their reaction was to doubt his sanity. Hajime thought, “Should I be angry?”, he was hesitating while getting back into his usual attitude.

Hajime put this matter aside for now, approached Regin then put Donner’s muzzle at his forehead.

“Well then, will it be a brave death or to survive and live in shame, which will it be?”

Having heard Hajime’s words, the Bearman and Haulia tribe looked at him with surprised eyes. By his speech just now, they heard that he’d overlook the Bearman tribe depending on the situation. It was a serious proposal from Hajime who had no mercy and was unreserved against his enemies. Kam and the others looked at Hajime in sorrow while thinking, “As expected his head was…”. Even though more veins popped on Hajime’s head, but because there’d be no progress otherwise, he let it through(go) temporarily.

Regin looked at Hajime with a surprised expression. It was the man who had brought about the complete change in the Haulia tribe, he thought this man wouldn’t show any mercy.

“… what does it mean, do you want to let us go?”

“Aa, you can return if you want, you know?”

“Conditions?”

To easily say that they could return, aside from Regin, the others were in commotion. From behind it could be heard, “If I hit his head now maybe it can help…”, was what Shia said with serious expression while alternating her gaze between her Sledgehammer and Hajime’s head. Voices of agreement could be heard from Kam and the others.

It was about the time that Hajime seriously thought of punishing them while more veins popped out. However, he worked harder to let that through(go).

“Aa, condition huh. When you reached Faea Belgaen I want you to say something to the Elders”

“… … A message?”

While he nervously thought about what kind of conditions he might demand, it turned out he only needed to be a messenger, and that took him aback. However, he was frozen when the content was spoken.

“”You owe me one””

“… … Kh!? That’s!”

“Well? What will you do? Will you accept it?”

Because he knew what that meant, Regin unintentionally let out a shout. Hajime was, with wind blowing from somewhere, waiting for Regin’s choice. “You owe me one” means, by letting the attacker return alive, there will be a time they must pay back their debt.

With the loss of one of the Elders, as well as how they agonized over ignoring the decision made by the Elders Conference to not intervene with him, if this message was passed on then they must unconditionally answer Hajime’s request.

If everything were to be seen objectively, in Jin’s situation and in Regin’s situation, where he one-sidedly tried to take revenge, coupled with the fact that they were allowed to live, the Elders Conference’s prestige will surely take a fall. They were outlaws because they disregarded the Elders. And can’t be said Hajime won’t one day turn his fang towards the Elders.

In other words, for Regin and his subordinates to survive meant that they’d brought back a weakness to their home country. Even after disregarding the decision from Elders Conference, they carried back a debt on their shoulders. Moreover, to return with half of their members dead after boasting about themselves as the strongest tribe… … just as Hajime had said they’d lived in shame.

Hajime choose to further his attack against Regin who wore a distorted expression.

“Add to that, you must remember that your subordinates’ deaths were your own responsibility, along with your crushing defeat against the Haulia”

“Guu”

There was a reason for Hajime to make such a condition. Of course it wasn’t out of benevolence. It was because there are details of the Seven Great Dungeons that he doesn’t know yet, so even though Faea Belgaen was an isolated country, there might be something else he must do in this country. There was also the tradition inherited from its founder after all. Hajime thought there might be little failures that will come along the way, for that sake, he thought that insurance was necessary.

To the worrying Regin, Hajime was ‘Gorik’ further pressing the muzzle.

“Decide it in five seconds. Once that’s over I’ll kill you one by one. “Quick judgement”. Isn’t that the basics (of a leader)?”

After that, Hajime began to count o~ne, two~ and Regin was panicking, however nothing comes to his mind.

“I, I understand. I wish for us to return!”

“I see. Then, go quickly. Don’t forget the message. If when the time comes for me to call for that and discover that you tried to fool me…”

A strong killing intent overflowed from Hajime’s whole body, accompanied with physical pressure. ‘Gulp’ the sound of gulp-ing resounded clearly.

“That day will be the end of Faea Belgaen”

No matter who looked at him, he had the touch of a bad debt collector, no, it’s more like a terrorist in this case. From behind, he could hear, “Thank goodness. It was the usual Hajime-san” and “Boss finally regained his mind!”, that kind of strange talk mixed with a relieved tone, well for now he’ll let it through(slide). He didn’t want to break the atmosphere that he made with so much effort. However, harsh punishment will follow.

With their pride broken by Haulia tribe and having heard how Regin desperately begged for his subordinates’ lives, they didn’t have the strength to protest and started to return home dejectedly. It might be because they are centered around a young one, they obediently accepted their defeat. But, for Regin, his influence in Faea Belgaen would likely disappear. There is also the possibility of being treated as fugitive. However, it was a mild punishment, after all he’d tried to take someone else’s life unjustly.

The Bearman tribe disappeared into the other side of the fog. After confirming that, Hajime turned around toward Shia and the others. At first, they were unable to see his expression because he looked down, then somehow the atmosphere became strange. Kam and the others who felt dishonored to have fallen into such frenzy and madness, started to become engrossed in speaking to Hajime about a lot of things, while not noticing the atmosphere. Only Shia , “Huh? Isn’t this bad?”, said that while drenched in cold sweat.

Hajime started to look up while swaying. There was a big smile on his face. However, his narrowed eyes weren’t smiling at all. Finally, because he thought Hajime’s appearance was strange, Kam timidly asked him.

“Bo-Boss?”

“Yes, isn’t it a serious thing? I thought this time, it was my fault. To say you’ve reached the standard just like this, I must have thought of it as a brake”

“N-no, even if you say that… … it was because of our own immaturity…”

“Nono, it’s okay, you know? I admit it myself after all. That’s why, that’s why I thought to honestly apologize… … but you had quite the reaction, didn’t you? Well, I understand. After all my usual attitude was like that… … however, however… … this out of place feeling I have, I must let it out… … you understand what that means, right?”

“N-no. We were a little…”

Kam also thought, “Ah, this is bad. He is angry now”, with cold sweat rapidly pouring out of him, step by step he tried to retreat. Maybe because some of the Haulia remember the training, they suddenly stood still while crying and whimpering.

And at that time, “Now is my chance!”, was what Shia thought then she instantly started to turn her feet to escape. She didn’t forget to make a man nearby as a shield.

However…

DOPANn!!

One bullet passed through between that man’s leg, hit the ground and ricocheted when it struck a tree’s root finally hitting Shia in the butt.

“Hakyun!”

It was one of Hajime’s gun skills “Polygonal Shot”. That’s how he aimed his shot at Shia’s butt. It was a useless gun skill, that could be thought as not that useless, that he’d uselessly practiced. Because of the impact from the bullet Shia raised a scream and ‘pyon’ jumped, only to collapse on the ground with her butt in the air. ‘Shuu-‘ Smoke rose from her butt. Shia was twitching in pain.

Having seen Shia convulsing and Hajime’s gun skill, Kam and the others were trembling in fear. The man who had a bullet pass between his leg covered his groin with both hands while teary eyed. He patted his groin, because when the bullet passed, it caught the shockwave from the bullet.

Without doing anything else, Hajime put back Donner into its holster, then his hanya-like smile returned. Finally, he yelled out with angry tone.

“For now, everyone will be hit once!”

Waaaaaa—!!

All of Haulia members immediately scattered trying to escape just like newborn spiders. For a while, screams and an angry roar could be heard resounding inside the Sea of Trees.

The only one who remained in her place was Shia with smoke rising from her butt, and

“… … when will we go to the Great Tree?”

The mutters from Yue who wasn’t involved with all the commotion.

Volume 4 Chapter 9


Deep inside the fog, Hajime and his party advanced toward the Great Tree. They left the fighting to Kam, while the other Haulia members scattered into their surroundings, looking for enemies as part of their training. Because the fact that unpreparedness is one’s greatest foe already is carved into their flesh, all members wore serious expressions. Most of all, the blue bruises on their bodies made it so it couldn’t be helped…

“Uu~, it’s still tingling~”

Shia was whining while rubbing her butt. Since before, she looked at Hajime with resentful eyes.

“Stop looking at me like that, it’s annoying.”

“To say that it’s annoying was too much. It’s not common sense to shoot at a girl’s butt. Moreover, using that useless high skill-”

“That can also be said to you. You seriously thought to hit my head and use another person as a shield to run away… … that was not something a normal person would do.”

Near them, a man from the Haulia tribe nodded his head.

“Uu, it was the result of education by Yue-san…”

“… … I was the one that raised Shia.”

“… … I can’t comment on that.”

While boasting that, Yue looked at Hajime as if saying “Praise me.” Hajime was averting his gaze making good use of “Let it through skill”.

After they advanced for 15 minutes while chatting harmoniously, their party finally arrived at the Great Tree.

Hajime’s first opinion when he looked at the Great Tree was,

“… … the heck this is”

, while half-surprised and half-doubting. Yue also wore the slight expression of someone who had her expectations crumbling. The two of them were imagining it using the scale and a larger version of the trees in Faea Belgaen.

However, the real Great Tree was… … splendidly withered.

Its size was not that far off from their imagination. Its diameter alone could be estimated around 50 meters. There is also the bizarre difference from the surrounding trees. While the surrounding trees had the ever expanding green leaves, only the Great Tree was withered.

“The Great Tree was already withered even before the founding of Faea Belgaen. However, it didn’t rot. Ever the never changing withered tree. With the surrounding fog’s nature and the forever-withered-without-rotting Great Tree, this place became a sacred place. Well, even with that said, although it could be called a tourist spot…”

Kam explained to Hajime and Yue making inquiring faces. While hearing the explanation, Hajime looked around the Great Tree’s roots. Just as Alfrerick had said, there was a lithograph built.

“This is… … just like Orcus’ door’s…”

“… … Nn, the same crest”

On the lithograph there were seven system-like squares with seven crests engraved on top of it. It was completely the same as the one on Orcus’ room’s door. To prove it, Hajime took out Orcus’ ring. The pattern on the ring was completely the same as one of the patterns on the Lithograph after all.

“It was the entrance to the Great Dungeon after all… but… … what should we do about this?”

Hajime approached the Great Tree and started to ‘thud thud’ hit it and of course there was no change, when he tried to ask Kam and the others if they know something about this tree, they only had No as an answer. Although he already heard all of the traditions from Alfrerick, there wasn’t any concerning the entrance. There was a possibility that he hid it so Hajime started to think, “Should I collect the debt?”,

At that time, Yue who was observing the lithograph raised her voice.

“Hajime… … look at this.”

“Nn? Is something there?”

What Yue noticed was on the other side of the lithograph. There were empty dents that corresponded with the seven crests on the other side.

“This is…”

Hajime put the Orcus ring in his hand to the dent that he saw corresponded to Orcus’ crest.

Then… … the lithograph began to faintly shine.

Wondering what happened, the surrounding Haulia tribe that were on lookout began to gather. For a while, they looked at the shining lithograph which lights gradually faded and somehow characters appeared in its place. Something was written there.

Four proofs.

Power of Rebirth.

Guidepost of Spun Bond.

A new trial will be opened to the one who has those proof.

“… … What does it mean?”

“… … Rhe four proofs… … maybe, wasn’t it referring to the other Dungeons’ proofs?”

“… … Then, what does the Power of Rebirth and Guidepost of Spun Bond mean?”

Shia answered to Hajime who puzzled over it.

“U~n, Guidepost of Spun Bond, wasn’t that it? Whether you got demi-human race as guides or not. Only demi-humans are able to move around easily in the Sea of Trees, and to gain the demi-humans as guides in the Sea of Tree was an exception among exception”

“… … I see. It was something like that”

“… … Next was regeneration… … Me?”

Yue pointed at herself who owns the special magic, “Auto Regeneration”. To test it, she thinly gave a cut to her finger to activate “Auto Regeneration” while moving to touch the Great Tree… … but there was no change at all.

“Muu… … it looks like that was wrong.”

“… … nn~, to the withered tree… … Power of Rebirth… … along with four proofs… … it’s possible that the four proofs meant we have to conquer half of the Seven Great Dungeons, then we might obtain the age of gods magic concerning rebirth, was it something like that?”

Hajime was wondering whether they must use that to restore the withered tree. Yue also gave a consenting face.

“Haa~, damn. So it was impossible to conquer it right now… … even though it was troublesome, there is nothing else we can do but to go to the other dungeons…”

“Nn…”

Hajime could only grind his teeth having come this far. Yue also regretted it. However, because they couldn’t enter the Great Dungeon now, although it worried them, it couldn’t be helped. They switched their target to obtaining three more proofs for now.

Hajime then gathered the Haulia tribe.

“As you’ve heard, we are aiming to conquer the other Great Dungeons now. The promise that you kept to guide us to the Great Tree is over now. If it’s the current you, even without Faea Belgaen’s protection, you’ll be able to survive inside the Sea of Trees. That means, this is good bye”

Then, he took a peek at Shia. His eyes asked her if she wanted to leave behind some words, and Shia understood perfectly that now was the time to voice her intentions. Even though she’ll be back, conquering three of the Great Dungeons would take much time. She wouldn’t be able to meet her family during that time.

Shia nodded, then took a step forward to talk to Kam and the others”

“Fath- “Boss! I have something to say!” … … huuh, father? This is my turn…”Kam took a step forward while ignoring Shia. ‘Bishi’, then stood at attention. On his side, “Father? Wait, father?”, Shia’s words could be heard and as if he was a British guardsman he just looked ahead while standing upright.

“A~, what is it?”

For the time being Shia called out, father? father?, but was ignored, while Hajime asked Kam. Kam, while not looking at Shia and ignoring her, started to tell the consensus from the Haulia tribe.

“Boss, please take us along!”

“Eh! Everyone also wanted to go with Hajime-san!?”

Shia was surprised at Kam’s words. In the discussion ten days ago, what happened with that mood when you were sending me off!?, were the words she said.

“We are Haulia but at the same time not Haulia! We are Boss’s subordinates! By all means, take us along! This is our tribe’s consensus!”

“Wait a sec, father! I’ve never heard of that! Rather, for what purpose did I have to go through those hardships…”

“I admit, we are jealous of Shia!”

“He admits that! He really said that! Really, what happened in those ten days!”

While Kam said the tribe’s consensus, he ignored Shia’s remark. What is this situation?, was what Hajime thought then frankly answered.

“I refuse.”

“Why!?”

Kam tried to ask the reason for Hajime’s quick reply. The other Haulia tribe members also approached Hajime in impatience.

“Of course it’s because you will only be hindrances, you idiot-”

“But!”

“Don’t get caught up in the moment. For our journey, even 180 days is too fast!”

“Is that true!?”

In addition to Kam and the others holding on to him, they started to think, “Even if it was not permitted, we will follow!” It seems because of the General Hartman-like( … )’s training, a strange sense of trust and reverence was born. If this keeps up, they’ll really follow Hajime into town. Because he didn’t want any to riot, he reluctantly gave them a condition.

“Then, that is. I want you to stay here to keep training. The next time I come to the Sea of Trees, if I can use you then I’ll make you my subordinates”

“… … Is there any falsehood in those words?”

“None at all.”

“If you lied, we’ll continue to call Boss’ name in the humans’ towns, as if we are creating a new religion, okay?”

“Y-you have quite the bad sense…”

“Well, that is because we have pride as Boss’ subordinates.”

What a bold subordinate that made Hajime’s cheeks twitch. Yue was ‘pon pom’ patting Hajime’s arm to comfort him. Hajime let out a sigh, next he looked up at the sky thinking the next time he came to the Sea of Trees will be troublesome.

“Sob, no one looked at me… … even though it’s the day I set off…”

Shia who was thrown to the side wrote the character ? on the ground, while no one minded her as expected.

* * *

Hajime, Yue, and Shia were escorted by Kam and the others to the boundary of the Sea of Trees, and once again they got on the magic-driven two-wheeler and dashed into the plain. The order of seating was Yue, Hajime, then Shia. Since he noticed Shia’s degree of clingy-ness had increased from the time in the Raisen Grand Canyon, Hajime tried ignoring that. Although, his reaction was immediately discovered by Yue who sat in front of him.

On his shoulder, Shia asked a question.

“Hajime-san. Now that I remember I’ve never heard about it, where was our next destination?”

“Ah? I never said it?”

“I never heard anything.”

“… … I already knew”

To the elated Yue, Shia let out a groan in protest.

“I-I am your comrade now, so please tell me something like that! Communication is important!”

“My bad. Our next destination is Raisen Grand Canyon”

“Raisen Grand Canyon?”

Having heard Hajime’s words, Shia put on a questioning expression. Currently, the Seven Great Dungeons that are already confirmed, excluding “Haltina Sea of Trees”, were “Guryuen Great Desert’s Volcanic Mountain” and “Shune Snowfield’s Ice Cave”. Because it was certainly there, doesn’t that make it the best destination?, was what she thought. Maybe because he guessed her question, Hajime started to say his intent.

“For now, I don’t even know if there was a Great Dungeon in Raisen Grand Canyon. Shune Snowfield is in the demon’s country so it’d be troublesome. Although it’s better to go to the Big Volcanic Mountain for now, if we go while passing Raisen that spreads from east to west, we’ll get there anyway. Maybe we’ll find a dungeon along the way, right?”

“T-to cross over the Raisen Grand Canyon…”

Instinctively, Shia’s cheeks twitched. Raisen Grand Canyon was popular as an execution ground. Recently, it was also the place where her family was almost annihilated. To have thought of that place as a highway shook her mind.

Hajime, who knew Shia was shaken because she was glued to him, revealed an amazed expression.

“You know, believe in your own power a little. For the current you, the demonic beasts inside the canyon aren’t that different from the demonic beasts in the boundary. Didn’t you know we can’t use magic inside Raisen? For you who specialized in body strengthening, it’s possible to move around without any hindrance. Rather, it’d be the stage for you”

“… … I am ashamed as your master”

“Uu~, I am ashamed~”

Yue looked at Shia with amazed eyes. Shia tried to change the topic.

“Th-then, because we are going to Raisen Grand Canyon, are we going to camp today? Or, are we going to the nearest village or town?”

“If possible, I wanted to arrange some seasoning for food, for the sake of the future it’d be great to get some material from the town. According to the map I’ve seen, there will be a town somewhere along here”

For extra measure, Hajime wanted to eat real food << .. >>. Also, in the future, he needed money to buy things in town. He wanted to exchange the materials he had with money before it rotted. One more thing, he wanted to try to settle in a place before setting off to the Raisen Grand Canyon.

“Haa~ is that so… … thank god”

Having heard Hajime’s words, Shia somehow showed a relieved expression. Hajime who was dumbfounded by it, “What is it”, asked her.

“Well~, from Hajime-san’s story, I thought you’d be satisfied by eating Raisen Grand Canyon’s demonic beasts’ meat… … Yue-san only needs Hajime-san’s blood so she wouldn’t have any problem… … I was thinking how I should persuade you for my personal food~, I am glad it was just my imagination. So Hajime-san also eats normal food!”

“Of course! Who likes to eat demonic beasts! … you, what did you think I am…”

“A new kind of demonic beast called Predator?”

“OK, you, I’ll tie you up until we reach the town”

“Wa-, stop, from where did you pull that out, that collar! Really, stop~ don’t put that on me~, Yue-san don’t just look, help me!”

“… … you reap what you sow”

In a sense, the three who advanced on the plain made a commotion that showed their good relationship.

After driving for several hours, finally the day grew dark and the town was finally seen in front of them. Hajime was glad, ever since he saw the sky after getting out of the Abyss, he finally got the feeling that “I am back”. Yue also looked somewhat excited. Yue turned her head slightly then their eyes met, and smiles floated on their faces.

“Umm~, although it was such a good atmosphere, this collar, can you release it? For some reason I couldn’t remove it… … umm, did you hear? Hajime-san? Yue-san? Wait, please don’t ignore me~ I am going to cry now! I am going to cry so hard that you’ll be depressed by it!”

Hajime and Yue only replied with their smiles.

Volume 4 Chapter 10


They can see a town in the distance. It was a small town enclosed with a surrounding moat and hedges. There was a gate facing the highway, with a hut by its side. It might be the guards’ post. Even though it was a small town, there was the arrangement for guards. Because of that, Hajime who thought they’d be able to do quality shopping, loosened his cheeks.

“… … If you are in a good mood, can you take off the collar already?”

Shia with a disappointed expression earnestly asked Hajime who smiled while looking at the town. Fixed on Shia’s neck was a collar with a black body embedded with a small inconspicuous crystal. It was something sturdy that Hajime used as punishment for Shia’s verbal slip. Because for some reason she couldn’t take it off, Shia asked Hajime to remove it only to have her words pass through Hajime’s ears.

Slowly, Hajime and his party could clearly see the town, so he put the magic-driven two-wheeler into the “Treasure Box”, and switched to walking on foot. It was because it’d cause a commotion to arrive with a jet black bike, after all.

Along the way, Shia kept ‘bla bla’ complaining. As expected, that just went through his ears and they finally arrived at the town’s gate. As he thought, the hut beside the gate was a guard’s post, with an armed man coming out of it. He was equipped with leather armor and a long sword on his waist, rather than a soldier he looked more like an adventurer. That adventurer-like man called Hajime and his party to stop.

“Please halt. Show your status plate. Also, what are your objectives coming to this town?”

It might be something like a regulation, because he somehow looked unmotivated. Hajime pulled out his status plate while answering the guard’s question.

“Our main objective is to secure rations. They’re to be used for our journey”

An indifferent voice, ‘Hu~m’, can be heard from the guard while he checked Hajime’s status plate. After that, he blinked his eyes, held the plate a little farther, then rubbed his eyes. Having seen the guardsman done that, Hajime with cold sweat thought, “Ah, this is bad, I forgot to hide that”.

Inside status plate, there is a function to hide the numerical value and skills’ column. Even for adventurer and mercenary, the leak of combat ability proved to be fatal. Hajime immediately tried to deceive the guard by telling him a lie.

“A while before, I was attacked by demonic beasts. It looks like it broke at that time”

“I-it broke? That was, well…”

The guard was perplexed. It was no wonder. After all, Hajime’s status plate didn’t display the level, and the numerical value of his stats, as well as his skills column were all over the place. Even though he sometimes heard of people losing the status plate, for it to be broken (in sense of it being bugged) was something he had never heard of. Normally he would just laugh it off, but something unbelievable was displayed after all, so he didn’t understand how to judge it.

To further his attack, Hajime shrugged his shoulders with a manner of someone totally bothered by it.

“If it wasn’t broken, isn’t that display too strange? It’s as if I am a monster. Mr. Guard, do I look like a monster that could destroy a town with just the tip of my finger?”?

To Hajime who used a joking gesture by opening both of his hand, the guard only gave out a wry smile. If what the status plate displayed was correct, then he would be a monster that easily surpassed even the demon kings and heroes. Even without hearing that explanation, he already considered the plate to be broken.

If he know he was truly a monster, surely, this guard would have fainted. Hajime who boldly told that lie, looked at Shia and Yue who had amazed expressions.

“Haha, well, of course I don’t see that. Even though I have never heard of any bug in the display, well, there is always a first for everything… … and those two…”

Turning his gaze to Yue and Shia, the guard asked to see their status plate. Only to be stunned. With his face dyed red, he looked alternately at Yue and Shia with a blank and unfocused look. Even though it was said before, Yue is a beautiful girl with a bisque doll-like appearance. Shia, while quiet, was also a beautiful girl that gave off a mysterious feeling. In other words, the guardsman was truly charmed by them.

Hajime unnaturally cleared his throat, then ‘Hah’, the guard turned his gaze to Hajime in panic.

“While we were attacked by the demonic beasts, this girl lost her plate. About this Rabbitman… … you understand, right?”

Maybe because he accepted that, the guard nodded in consent then gave back Hajime’s status plate.

“Even so, just where did you get your hands on such a beauty. Aren’t gray-haired members of the Rabbitman tribe rare? Are you actually a rich person?”

The guard asked Hajime with envy and jealousy mixed into his voice, while continuously taking peeks at the two. Hajime only shrugged his shoulders without giving any answer.

“Well whatever. You may pass.”

“Aa, thanks. Oops, wait a sec. Where can I sell raw materials?”

“Ang? If it’s that, there is the adventurer guild if you go straight through the central road. If you want to personally bring it to the store, just ask the guild. They will give you a simple map of this town.”

“Ooh, you’ve been so kind to us. Thanks”

After receiving the information from the guard, Hajime and his party passed through the gate and entered the town. From the gate it seems that this town’s name was Brook. Inside the town was a lively atmosphere. Even though it wasn’t at the level of Hol-ad town which he’d seen at the outskirts of Orcus, there are quite a lot of stalls along with voices advertising their wares, and sounds of people haggling could be heard.

With such liveliness, it somehow lifted one’s feeling. Not just Hajime, Yue’s eyes began to look happy. However, since before, Shia was trembling and staring at Hajime with teary eyes.

Without saying anything, she only stared at him with teary eyes and because it made him anxious he let out a sigh. “To interrupt my happy mood” , was what Hajime complained in his mind while giving a glance at Shia.

“What is it? Even though we’re finally inside a town, for you to make a face similar to a gorilla demonic beast that desperately tried to block a massive rock that fell from above”

“Who’s a gorilla! Rather, how do you know what kind of defeated form that is! If it’s Hajime-san, then it’d be blown in one move! It’s somehow pitiful just by imagining it!”

“… … that’s something like poking your side with teary eyes”

“Is that a follow-up attack!? That’s too cruel! Uh, that isn’t it!”

Shia was busily rebutting while angry. She tried to appeal, “I am unhappy!”, with her whole body while flailing her hands. By the way, the episode with the gorilla-like demonic beast was a story from the time he experimented to polish the mass compression method. By no means did he not enjoy the bullying. Yue was happily poking at that time. Also, this demonic beast was the one who owned the “Great Arm” special magic.

“It’s this! This collar! Because of this I was misunderstood as a slave! Hajime-san, if you understand then remove it! Uu, it’s cruel~, aren’t we companions~”

It seems that was what Shia was angry about. Even though they are travel companions, she was shocked to have received the same treatment as a slave. Naturally, the collar that Hajime put on her wasn’t a slave’s collar, and it didn’t have the power to restrain Shia. Even Shia understood that. But, whatever is said, a shock is a shock.

Having seen that Shia, Hajime scratched his head then looked into Shia’s eyes.

“You know, for a non-slave demi-human, moreover a popular and high-in-demand rabbitman wouldn’t be able to walk freely inside a town, right? Added to that, a gray-haired one like you would attract attention along with your outstanding figure and style. If you declared that you weren’t someone’s slave, you’d be instantly marked down when we entered the town. After that, there would be a storm of kidnappers coming. It’ll be trouble-… … why are you being giddy for?”

While explaining things, Hajime suddenly glared at Shia, who became embarrassed with blushing cheeks when she heard the explanation. Yue also coldly looked at Shia.

“Mo-mou, Hajime-san. To start saying something like that in front of everyone. To say, I have an outstanding figure and style, the cutest in the world and charming, mou! It was embarras–bugera!?”

Yue’s golden right straight found its way into the cheek of Shia who was caught up in the moment. With a love filled mind, Shia raised a scream then collapsed. Without using body strengthening, she got up while rubbing her cheek that was reddened in a different way from before.

“… … Don’t get carried away”

“… … I’b sobby, Yue-zan”

Having heard Yue’s cold words, Shia’s body trembled. While amazed by their appearance, Hajime continued his explanation.

“A~ I will say the conclusion. Inside human territory, I am protecting you by saying you’re a slave. If I didn’t do it, there’d be a lot of troubles and it’ll be all because of you”

“That is… … although I understand it…”

She understood the reason and merit. But, Shia had an unhappy expression, felt it hard to accept that after all. Because she had a strong yearning to be called their companion, she was unable to simply accept it. This time it was Yue who told Shia.

“… … Don’t care what the small fries think of you”

“Yue-san?”

“… … The most important thing is it was enough if the ones important to you understand you. … … isn’t it?”

“… … … … Th-that’s right. That’s right.”

“… … Nn, even though I am reluctant… … Shia is someone I recognize as a companion… … Don’t mind the small things”

“… … Yue-san… … ehehe. Thank you very much”

She was a vampire princess who wielded her power and listened to the masses. Even though she was betrayed, she found a new answer that even little words were able to carry a massive weight. That’s why, her words were able to break the stone inside Shia’s heart. All members of the Haulia tribe, even Hajime and Yue, understood that Shia has become important to Hajime and Yue. It was unnecessary to go through the trouble of getting 1,000 people to understand it. Of course, even if they could do it, there was no need to do that…

Having heard Yue’s words, Shia shyly smiled while taking a peek at Hajime. She was expecting him to say something.

Hajime who felt it can’t be helped, reluctantly started to spin his words.

“Well, I won’t abandon you if you were attacked because they found out you’re not a slave”

“Even if it will make everyone in this town your enemies?”

“You know, didn’t I already do that with the Empire’s soldiers?”

“Then, you’ll do it even if the enemy was a country! Fufu!”

“What did you say? No matter even if it was the world or the gods it won’t change anything. If it was an enemy, no matter who it is, I will fight”

“Kufufu, did you hear that? Yue-san. Did you hear what Hajime-san just said? We are important to him, right?”

“… … Hajime’s only important person is me”

“Wa-, please read the mood! At this time, you should honestly say the usual “… … Nn”!”

Shia was happy and enjoying it, despite her complaints. Hearing that, when the time comes, he will even fight against the world. As expected it is something that’d make a woman happy. Especially if the other person was the one you’re in love with.

Hajime who narrowed his eyes looked at the two playing with each other (or so it looks like to him), started to explain Shia’s collar.

“One more thing, because that collar incorporates telepathy ore and a special ore, use it if you deem it necessary. It’s able to be used by directly pouring magic into it”

“Telepathy ore and a special ore?”

Telepathy ore is a mineral that’s able to transfer thoughts. It was an ore created by Creation magic that gave the user the skill “Telepathy”, the amount of magic usage is proportional to the distance. Most of all, currently in this age there was nothing like telepathy or the telephone, so everyone who has the same ore within the range will be able to hear the secret talk.

The special ore itself was created using Creation magic to give the user the skill “Presence Perception”+ Specific Perception””. When Specific Perception was used, it is possible to catch only a specific presence among a crowd, and identify a presence among many. When it was used, it’d take the role as a beacon by pouring magic into it. The strength of the beacon is proportional to the amount of magic used.

Having heard Hajime’s explanation, Shia raised a praising voice.

“By the way, that collar can be removed by giving it a certain amount of magic, you know?”

“I see~, in other words… … because you wanted to always hear my voice, and know my whereabouts, is that what Hajime-san felt? Mou, do you like me that much? As expected, it was a little too-, rather, ah, it’s not like I hate i-Bbaberun!?”

“… … Don’t get carried away”

“‘Sob’, I’b sobby”

With a beautiful picturesque curve, Yue’s kick came flying into the back of Shia’s head, who collapsed after yelling a strange scream. A cold voice could be heard from Yue. Even though she was weak at close combat… … Yue delivered a splendid high kick, then Shia apologized with tears in her eyes. Even if she recognized her as a journey companion, it seems she won’t forgive her if Shia tried to approach Hajime. Most of all, it was questionable whether Shia’s behaviour and speech could be called an approach.

With such a happy(?) mood, they continued walking on the main street until they discovered a signboard with a large sword drawn on it. It was the same signboard as the one seen in Hol-ad town’s adventurer guild, although the scale was two sizes smaller than the one in Hol-ad.

After confirming the signboard, Hajime stepped inside by opening the door with composure.

Volume 5 Chapter 1


Because guilds have the image of a place where rough people gather, Hajime thought it’d be a dirty place, but it was unexpectedly clean. There was a counter in front of the entrance, and a restaurant to the left. There were some people that seemed to be adventurers, eating and chatting. Judging from how no one ordered sake, it might be because they didn’t serve it. For those who wanted to drink, they had to go to a bar.

When Hajime and his party entered the guild, naturally the adventurers turned their gazes toward them. At first, because it was just three unknown people they only paid a little attention to them, but when their gazes turned toward Yue and Shia, the curiosity in their eyes increased. There were those who, “Hou”, raised voices of admiration, there were those who stared blankly in admiration just like the guard, and then there were those that were beaten by their girlfriends. It was just like adventurers to not stop at a slap.

It was a favorable template, even though there were some people that tried to mess with them, it seemed that they logically held back and simply observed. Because there was no need to keep standing still, Hajime happily went toward the counter.

In the counter was a charming… … smiling auntie. Her build was good. Her width about twice Yue’s. Apparently a beautiful woman as a receptionist was just a fantasy. It was like how the real and professional maids on Earth were aunties. No matter which world you’re in the harsh reality is the same. By the way, Hajime was just normal, he didn’t expect to see a beautiful woman as the receptionist. If he said he didn’t then he didn’t. That’s why, Hajime wanted Yue and Shia to stop their icy glares. From a little while ago, their glares had been pierced into him.

Maybe because she knew what was going on in the mind of Hajime and his party, the auntie kept giving them a charming.

“Even though you have a flower in both hands, is that still insufficient? It is regrettable that I am not a beautiful receptionist”

… … The auntie probably didn’t use special magic for mindreading. Hajime, with twitching cheeks was somehow able to give an answer.

“No, I have never thought about that”

“Ahahahaha, are you underestimating a woman’s intuition? I am simply able to understand a man’s simplicity. Don’t try to avert your eyes too much, it’ll reduce your credibility, you know?”

“… … I am deeply impressed”

Hajime’s answer was, “Oh my, to be old and suddenly giving out a sermon, because it was our first meeting, can you forgive me?”, an unapology-like apology to the auntie, after all it’s not like he hated her. The adventurers who were eating, took a peek at Hajime while saying, “Ah~ he also got preached to by the auntie~”. It seemed the adventurers were behaving because of this auntie.

“Well then, once more, welcome to adventurer guild, Brook’s branch. What is your business?”

“Aa, I want to know where to sell raw materials”

“Selling raw materials it is. Then, can you show me your status plate first?”

“Nn? Is it necessary to show your status plate for purchasing something?”

To Hajime’s question, the auntie was, “Oh my?”, showing that kind of expression.

“Aren’t you an adventurer? Certainly, the status plate isn’t necessary to purchase something, but if you are confirmed as an adventurer there will be a 10% increase in the price of the things you sell”

“I see”

Just as auntie said, there were various privileges as an adventurer. It was because the adventurers were the ones that collected raw materials such as magic stones and recovery medicine that’s necessary for everyday lives. Also, it wasn’t known when the town would be attacked by demonic beasts, so no amateur tried to collect those raw materials. It was natural to give out privileges corresponding to the dangers.

“There are other benefits, such as 10-20% discount for hotels and shops associated with the guild, and it’s possible to freely use carriages for people with a high rank. What will you do? Do you want to register? The fee is 1,000 ruta.”

Ruta is this world’s common currency that’s used in the northern continent, Tortoise. Zagaruta ore is the special ore used to make this currency, the difference in colours are made by mixing it with different minerals using a special method along with the carved seal. Blue, red, yellow, purple, green, white, black, silver, and gold were the colours, from the left the values are 1, 5, 10, 50,100, 500, 1.000, 5.000, and 10.000 ruta respectively. Surprisingly, its value was the same as Japan’s.

“U~n, I see. Even though it was explained with great effort, I can’t register now. I am sorry, I don’t have any money at all. Is it possible for me to sell it first? Of course, the first sale value is good as it is.”

“Don’t say that in front of these two cuties. I will help, it’s not like it’ll inconvenience me, you know?”

Auntie was so cool. Hajime decided to accept her goodwill, and showed his status plate.

He made sure to conceal it this time, it only displayed name, age, sex and job. Although auntie also asked for Yue and Shia’s, but was cut off. Although these two didn’t have plates to begin with, it was possible to ask for it. However, their status’s numerical value and skills column would be seen by auntie.

Although Hajime wanted to see their statuses, he thought their special magic would be described on the skills column for sure. If these three existences were publicized it’d only be troublesome, so they decided to put it on hold.

New information was written on the returned status plate. There was an occupation column beside the job column, what was written there was “adventurer” along with a blue mark at its side.

This blue mark was the adventurer’s rank. It continued with red, yellow, purple, green, white, black, silver, and gold. … you might have noticed it. That’s right, adventurer ranks are the same as currency. In other words, blue ranked adventurers were, “Your value is only 1 ruta, ptchoe”, or something along that line. It was painful. Surely, the previous guild master who thought of this system was someone twisted.

By the way, the limitations for someone with a non-combat profession was black. It seems because the black rank barely reached four digits, you’d be applauded to make it that far. Someone who reached gold rank would be the object of admiration, you should be able to understand how the colours stand for adventurers now.

“If you’re a man, then work hard to reach black, okay? Don’t show any uncool sides to these girls.”

“Aa, I’ll do that. Then, is it okay to sell them now?”

“No problem. I have the qualifications for appraisal, so show it to me.”

It seemed auntie was not only a receptionist but also able to appraise sold items. She was an excellent auntie. Hajime already took out the raw materials from the “Treasure Box” and placed it in a bag beforehand. Those items were demonic beasts’ furs, nails, fangs and magic stones. When the container was put on the counter and the raw materials were seen, auntie displayed an astonished expression.

“Th-these are-!”

She timidly took it, then ascertained the items inside-out. After holding her breath in nervousness, auntie finally looked up, then she gave out a sigh and looked at Hajime.

“You’ve brought something unexpected. Aren’t these… … from the Sea of Trees’ demonic beasts?”

“Aa, that’s right.”

Hajime also wanted to remove the template here, that was why the raw materials from Abyss’s demonic beasts couldn’t be taken out here. If unknown materials were taken out, it’d immediately cause a big commotion. Even though he was hesitating because the raw materials from the Sea of Trees’ demonic beasts were also unusual, he didn’t have any other raw materials, so he sold that. Having seen auntie’s reaction, it was unusual after all.

If he took out raw materials from the Abyss, it’d be like, the Guild head appeared! Sudden raise in rank! The Receptionist lady’s eyes became hearts!, it’d be that kind of template… … it was a good thing he didn’t do that. That’s why, Hajime wanted Yue and Shia to stop looking at him with icy glares, because it made his body tremble.

“… … You are also unexpected” Auntie looked at Hajime in amazement.

“I don’t understand what you mean.”

Even though he had changed, his otaku soul couldn’t be erased… … somehow it became like this. Hajime who pretend to not know anything, looked away from reality.

“Because there are a lot of good quality raw materials from the Sea of Trees, thanks for selling them.”

Auntie, even though she didn’t know anything, continued to speak. It seemed she was capable of reading the mood. She truly was a pleasant and excellent auntie.

“Are these unusual after all?”

“You know. A human’s sense of direction would be driven out of control inside the Sea of Trees, because once you get lost there would be no second time. It’s a place with high risk. That’s why no one tries to go there. Although it’s possible to buy demi-human slaves to enter it, it’s more profitable to sell them at central. They will sell at a high price, and it’ll make it easier to raise one’s name.”

Auntie took a peek at Shia. She probably guessed that they received Shia’s help to go around the Sea of Trees. It seems, thanks to Shia, she didn’t become suspicious of the raw materials from the Sea of Trees.

After auntie assessed all of the raw materials, she presented the money. The value of the sold items were 487,000 ruta. It was an excellent amount.

“Is this much okay? I think it’ll sell for more at central.”

“Well, I don’t mind this much.”

Hajime received 51 pieces of the Ruta currency. This money, maybe because of an ore characteristic was strangely light, that’s why it wasn’t bothersome to carry more than 50 pieces ruta currency. After all, if it was a bother, Hajime could just put it inside the “Treasure Box.”

“By the way, I heard from the guardsman that I can get a simple map of this town…”

“Aa, please wait a moment… … here, this is it. Please refer to it because the recommended inn and stores are written there.”

On the given map, there was elaborate useful information and descriptions written with simplicity that made it a wonderful item. He felt it was rather unbelievable for this to be free of charge.

“Oi oi, is this okay? For such a splendid map to be free of charge. I thought it’d need some money to make something of this level…”

“I don’t mind, I only do it as a hobby. For those that have the job to make it, that’s just like a scribble.”

Auntie truly an excellent person. Just why did this person become the receptionist of the guild?, was the the level he wanted to rebut. Surely, there might be a sublime drama behind it.

“I see. Well, it helps.”

“That’s a good word. Moreover, because you have money, please just stay here for a while. Although this town’s public order isn’t bad, there might be some reckless men out there, because of these two.”

Auntie who paid attention until the last minute, truly was a good person. Hajime answered, “I’ll do that”, while grinning, then turned his feet toward the entrance. Yue and Shia followed suit after bowing their head. Some adventurers in the restaurant were sneakily whispering, while their eyes were glued to Yue and Shia to the end.

“Fumu, in a lot of ways, they are interesting people…”

Auntie happily muttered toward their backs.

* * *

Hajime and his party, more than a map calling it a guidebook, then decided on an inn called “Masaka Inn.” According to the description, it served delicious food with good security, it also had a bath. The last description was what decided it. Although the price was rather expensive, there were no problems because they had the money for it. Slightly, they thought what followed was that “Masaka”…

On the inn’s first floor, there was a dining room filled with some people having their meal. When Hajime and his party entered, gazes were focused on Yue and Shia as promised. They ignored that, when they arrived at the counter-like place, what appeared was a girl around 15 that cheerfully greeted them.

“Welcome-, welcome to “Masaka Inn”! Today, are you here for lodging? Or are you only here to eat?”

“Lodging. Although I’ve seen in the guidebook, is this place as good as described?”

The girl nodded when Hajime showed auntie’s special map.

“Aa, it’s the introduction from Catherine-san. Yes, it was as written. How many nights do you wish to stay?”

Although the girl tried to promptly continue the staying procedure, Hajime was thinking of something else. Hajime was shocked that the auntie’s name was Catherine. The girl called out to him with, “Umm~ mr. costumer?”

“Ah, aa, sorry. Only for one night. The one with meals and bath.”

“Yes. The bath will be 100 ruta per 15 minutes. Currently, it’s empty at this time”

The girl showed him the time table. Because he wanted to enjoy it, he wanted to book the men’s and women’s side for two hours. When he said that, “Eh, for two hours!?”, the girl was surprised just like that. It couldn’t be helped, Hajime was Japanese after all.

“Then, um~, what about the rooms? Although there are double and triple rooms…”

The girl looked at Hajime and his party with curiosity. She was in her puberty after all. However, Hajime could feel the other customers who were eating their meals perk their ears up. Although he knew Yue and Shia were beautiful, it looked like they stood out more than he expected. Because there are lots of people they don’t know here, Hajime was slightly paralyzed.

“Aa, the triple room please.”

Hajime said that without any hesitation. Their surroundings became noisy, and the girls’ cheeks were blushing in slight red. However, there was a person who objected Hajime’s words.

“… … It’s no good. Two double rooms”

It was Yue. The surrounding customers, especially the males looking toward Hajime with expressions that said, “Serves you right!”. They interpreted Yue’s words as to divide them between men and women. However, Yue’s next words put them in despair.

“… … One for me and Hajime. Shia in the other room.”

“Wa-, what’s with that! I don’t want to be left out! The triple room is better, you know!”

To the fiercely protesting Shia, Yue only said one thing.

“… … It’ll be distracting if Shia was there”

“Distracting… … what do you mean”

“… … What is… … What?”

“Bu!? Wa-, don’t say that in this place! That’s vulgar!”

Having heard Yue’s words, the men who fell into despair begin to turn their eyes filled with flames of envy toward Hajime. The inn’s girl, with a reddened face looked alternatively between Hajime and Yue. Hajime who thought it’d make him ashamed if this keeps up, tried to stop it but his plan was a little too slow.

“Th-then, Yue-san please stay in the other room! Hajime-san and I will stay in the same room!”

“… … Hou, then?”

Yue’s cold and piercing gaze turned toward Shia who pointed her finger. Because of its power, Shia who remembered her training days trembled, “Eei, woman’s courage”, said that, then returned to the gaze while loudly declaring.

“Th-then, I’ll give my virginity to Hajime-san!”

Silence came. No one, not even one word was said, not even noise was heard. Now, everyone in the inn were focused on Hajime and his party, and stared at them. From the kitchen, the girl’s parent were, “Ara ara, maa maa” and “Youth is good”, said something along those lines.

Yue was swaying with eyes of absolute zero.

“… … Today is your death anniversary”

“Uh, I, I won’t lose! I will defeat Yue-san and become the main heroine from now on!”

“… … I’ll show you, no disciples were stronger than their master.”

“I’ll usurp it!”

An abnormal pressure gushed out from Yue, and Shia who was trembling shouldered her Sledgehammer. It was truly pandemonium, everyone was nervous and gulped in this critical atmosphere.

Then…

GOCHINn! GOCHINn!

“Hiu!?”

“Hakyu!?”

The sound of fists hitting the girls came followed by their screams. Yue and Shia, with teary eyes, crouched while covering their heads with both hands. The one who hit the two’s heads were of course Hajime.

“Geez, you’re troubling everyone, and above all it shamed me.”

“… … Uu, Hajime’s love is painful…”

“J-just a little more, just a little more time then… … with body strengthening the pain would be…”

“You reap what you sow, idiot-”

Hajime turned his cold gaze toward the two, then returned to face the girl. The girl corrected her posture when Hajime looked at her.

“I am sorry for the commotion. Triple room, please”

“… … Tr-triple room with this situation… … i-in other words, three person? A-amazing… … hah, don’t tell me booking the bath for two hours is also for that!? Washing each others’ body! Then… … d-doing this and that… … how abnormal!”

The girl’s mind had gone for a trip. The landlady who couldn’t stand it any longer dragged the girl into the interior. The man who seemed to be her parent continued to finish the procedure. When he gave the key he apologized, “I am sorry about my girl”, and in his eyes were, “You’re a man after all, right? I know how you feel”, that kind of unwelcomed misunderstanding. Surely, he was the type that would say, “Did you enjoy the night?”, when tomorrow arrived.

Because no matter what he says it would be misunderstood, along with the other customers who blankly sent skeptical gazes, with Yue and Shia who were still crouched on the floor shoulder to shoulder, Hajime ran away straight to the third floor where his room was located. After a while, the stopped time moved and it became noisy again downstairs, and Hajime who felt strangely tired decided to ignore that. When Yue and Shia entered the room, they moved their bed, while Hajime who had dived into the bed already shut down his consciousness.

After sleeping for several hours, Hajime was woken up by Yue when it was time for supper, then the three went down to the dining room. Somehow, the customers who were there when they checked in were still there.

For a moment, Hajime felt his cheeks twitch, then he assumed his calm and sat down on the seat. Immediately, the inn girl from before came as the waitress and said with a reddened face, “I am sorry for before” Although she apologized, she couldn’t hide the curiosity in her eyes. The food he ordered was delicious and it was the normal food he finally got to eat after a long time, so he wanted to slowly eat it, but he couldn’t help but to secretly sigh.

Inside the bath, although the time for male and female were different, Yue and Shia trespassed, then once again pandemonium was raised only to be punished by Hajime with hits on the head, and the silhouette of the inn girl could be seen moving around sneakily, when it was found out she was peeping by the landlady, she got spanked on the butt…

Even at the time for sleep, Yue and Shia naturally came into Hajime’s bed, while his right arm was clung to, Shia who clung on to his left arm cried because of the coldness of the artificial arm. He could feel Shia through the pseudo-nerves, especially the direct feeling of that lethal weapon, and it disturbed his mind. When that was discovered, Yue stared closely at him with dead-like eyes, it continued for all night long…

The next morning, Hajime vowed. Next time he would just order a double room for Yue and him without anymore questioning. It didn’t matter if Shia sulked because of it. After all, Yue’s silence was not very good for his mental health.

After eating breakfast, Hajime handed some money to Yue and Shia, to ask them to help buy the necessary items for travel. There’s some time until the time for checking out came. So, while Yue and Shia does the errand, he’ll finish his tasks inside the room.

“What tasks?”

Shia honestly questioned him. However, Hajime was,

“There is something I wanted to make. Because it was already planned, I am sure it only needs a few hours to finish. Although I seriously thought to finish it last night… … somehow I was strangely feeling tired yesterday”

“… … Th-that’s so. Yue-san. I-is it okay for me to look for clothes?”

“… … Nn, no problem. I wanted to look around the stalls”

“Ah, that’s good! Yesterday we only saw it for a moment, after we’re done shopping let’s go eat”

While averting their gazes, Yue and Shia began to noisily talk about shopping. Although they knew they were the cause, they didn’t want to admit it, so they changed the topic calmly.

“… … You guys, in truth you’re getting along well.”

Hajime’s mutters only go through their ears.

Volume 5 Chapter 2


Currently, Yue and Shia had gone out to town. Because it was only several hours before noon, they must move as planned. Their objectives were food(groceries) and clothes for Shia, as well as some medicine. Weapons and armor were unnecessary because they have Hajime.

The town was already wrapped up in it’s day to day hustle and bustle. The stall keepers vigorously called out to customers, there are housewives and adventurers haggling intensively. There are also food stalls that made you think, ‘Isn’t it too crowded in the morning?’, while the smell of burning meat and sauce drifted around.

Because tool shops and groceries would be too crowded at this time, these two decided to look for Shia’s clothes first.

From auntie; Catherine-san’s map, it mentioned the stores for everyday wear, specialty stores for high-class dresses, and the recommended stores for adventurers and travelers. As expected, au… … Catherine-san was someone with good abilities. She could accomplish anything as long as she wished for it.

These two immediately visited a certain shop for adventurers. They decided to buy everyday clothes for when they went back.

Inside the shop, as expected of something Catherine-san recommended, there were a lot of items. The quality was good, they were practical and functional, it was a store that wouldn’t betray your expectations.

However, inside was…

“Oh my~, welcome ? What lovely girls. To have you coming here, it makes onee-san happy~, I will sure~ly give a go~od service ? ”

There was a monster. With a height of 2 meters, cladded with armor made of muscles, face thick with make-up, on top of its bald head, ‘chokon’, long hair grew in only one place, and that was made into a three-knit braid and tied with a pink ribbon. When it moved, its muscles were twitching and ‘gishimishi’ sound could be heard from it, with both hands on its cheeks, it twisted its body. Its clothes were… … no, it couldn’t be said as that. At the very least, ‘gon’ thick limbs, with a garment that made its stomach muscles completely visible.

Yue and Shia stiffened. Shia already passed out, while Yue steeled herself, having seen a monster that surpassed the Abyss’ demonic beasts.

“My oh my~? What happened to the two of you? Cute girls shou~ldn’t make that face. Come on, smile smile?”

“No matter what, everything was your fault, it was your fault that I couldn’t smile!” The grand rebuttal that Yue and Shia were somehow able to resist making. Even though these two have the level of highest potential out of all of humanity, they didn’t think they could win against this monster.

However, because the monster approached them with a big smile, Yue could not to bear it and inadvertently muttered.

“… … Human?”

At that moment, the monster raised an angered voice.

“Who~ could make a legendary class demonic beast run away? As you can see, credibility behind that is zero, or rather it’s minus. How could you call me a monster!!”

“I-I am sorry…”

Yue trembled with teary eyes. Shia, had long since… … been chilled in her lower body. After Yue apologized, the monster smiled(?) once again and continued its service.

“It’s o~kay. Then? For today, what kind of item do you want to bu~y?”

Shia stayed still even now, while Yue steeled herself to look for Shia’s clothes. Maybe it was because she already wanted to go home, Shia gripped Yue’s skirt and shook both the skirt and her head. However when, smilingly, the monster said, “Leave it to me~”, it carried Shia on its shoulder into the store. At that time, Yue looking at Shia’s eyes the expression of saw a pig that got sold for meat.

In conclusion, the monster that was called manager Crystabel-san could be considered a splendid manager. Shia who was taken inside the store also realized it, that’s why when it offered her the dressing room, she was undeniably grateful.

Yue and Shia expressed their gratitude to manager Crystabel. When they did that, they could feel the charm from the manager’s smile, it was a woman’s(?) virtue.

“Well~, at first I wondered what might happened to me, but it was an unexpectedly good person. That manager-san”

“Nn… … we can’t judge people from their appearances”

“Right~”

While chatting that way, they wandered around as their destination was the tool shop. However, these two stood out. On their way, when they noticed it, they were already surrounded by ten men. Most of them looked like adventurers, but among them there was also someone with an apron from the shop from somewhere.

One of the men came forward. Although Yue didn’t remember it, this man was one of the adventurers inside the guild when Hajime and his party talked to Catherine.

“Your names are Yue-chan and Shia-chan, right?”

“? … … that’s right”

Yue who didn’t know what he wanted squinted her eyes. Shia, because she was a demi-human, was surprised to be called by “chan”.

The man who heard Yue answer, looked back at the other men behind him and nodded, Yue could see they steeled their minds. The other men also moved forward to the front of Yue or Shia.

Then…

“””””” Yue-chan, please go out with me!!””””””

“””””” Shia-chan! Become my slave!!””””””

In other words, well, something like that. The pick-up lines for Yue and Shia were different because Shia was a demi-human. Even though they needed the master’s permission to transfer the rights of a slave, they must already know how intimate the relationship between Hajime and his party was from their talk at the inn yesterday. So to persuade Hajime they must get Shia first… … or so they thought.

By the way, maybe because the impact from the talk at the inn was too strong, they fact that the slave pact made it so that the slave was unable to oppose its master, somehow escaped their minds. If not so, they should have discovered that Shia wasn’t a slave. Although the strength of the pact could be lowered, no one actually did that.

Well, Yue and Shia who got confessed to were…

“… … Shia, the tool shop is over here”

“Ah, yes. It’s good if we can buy everything at once”

They continued their walk as if nothing had happened.

“Wa-, please wait! Your answer!? Tell us your ans- “”I refuse”” … … guu…”

Because their attitude seemed to think nothing about it, the man let out a groan, some men bent their knees and crumbled on the spot (orz). However, there were also some that didn’t give up. That just goes to show how far above normal Yue and Shia’s level of beauty was. As a result, it couldn’t be helped if they became reckless because of it.

“Then, I’ll make you mine by force!”

The reckless man shouted that, then ‘ginn’ light came from the other men’s eyes. They surrounded the two so they could catch them, then impatiently drew near them.

Finally, the man who talked to them first, jumped out to catch Yue. When the Japanese see that they’d surely shout, “Ah, Lupi* Dive”, something like that.

Yue coldly muttered one thing.

“”Ice Coffin””

Immediately, the man was confined inside a coffin of ice except his head, pulled by gravity and fell. “Gupe!?”, was the miserable scream the man who did the Lu**n Dive raised when he reached the ground.

The other men knew that Ice Coffin was classified as advanced water system magic and were shocked that Yue invoked it just by saying its name. They interpreted it on their own and in their whispers, “She said the incantation beforehand” and “The magic circle must be hidden inside her clothes”, or something along those lines could be heard.

Yue was, walking up determined to the man who was wrapped in ice. Although surrounding them was a shocked air, having seen Yue’s prowess, there was already the second **pin!, among them. That’s why, Yue showed them a warning.

Yue melted the ice that wrapped the man little by little. The man was glad because he might get out of it. In addition, he watched Yue with feverish eyes.

“Y-Yue-chan. I am sorry to do it suddenly! But, I truly think of you as…”

Even though the man wrapped in ice tried to get his feelings across, his words stopped. If you ask why, it was because he noticed the small place where the ice melted. It was…

“U-umm, Yue-chan? Why, umm, why… … is it only the part between my groin?”

That’s right, Yue only melted the ice between the man’s groin. The man was still perfectly restrained. Because he felt something bad would happen, the man with cold sweat said, “Surely, that can’t be, right? Right? Right?”, when he saw Yue’s expression.

Yue curved her mouth slightly to the man.

“… … Aim and shoot”

Then, volleys of gravel continuously hit the man’s nether region.

—— Agh ——!!

—— Stop already-

—— moth~er!

The man’s scream resounded in the morning street. The sound of Mao collecting coins could be heard (To refresh your memory of the sound, please imagine the old **rio) from the man’s groin that was continuously aimed at. Surely the inside was like something that received a boxer’s Demey Roll.

The surrounding men, not only the one that surrounded them, but also the unrelated onlookers, and stall keepers nearby, all crumbled while covering their groin with both hands.

The barrage that seemed to continue for eternity, finally stopped in consideration of the man who already lost his consciousness. Even though it was impossible to lose consciousness with only one blow, it could be done by accumulated damage along with wind magic. As if it was a miracle, Yue who ‘fuu’ blew her forefinger, left her words as a parting gift.

“… … Good, you’ve become a otomen « Maiden »”

On this day, a man died, and became the second Crystabel, and Mariabel-chan was born. This person, under training from manager Crystabel, became the manager of the branch store, and although it was able to increase its fame… … that’s a story for another time.

Yue got her second name, “Crotch Smasher”, that name caused uproars in the adventurer guild and even reached the capital, it was capable of making male adventurers shudder, but this was also a story for another time.

Yue and Shia ignored the frightened gazes of men and continued their shopping. On their way, they could hear girls say, “Yue-oneesama…”, but ignored that and continued their shopping.

* * *

When Yue and Shia went back to the inn, Hajime already finished his work.

“Good work, somehow, there seems to be a fuss inside town, did something happen?”

It seemed he noticed their commotion.

“… … There is no problem.”

“A~, un, that’s right. There’s no problem at all.”

To see a monster as the dress store manager, and had heaven call for a man, the two said it was nothing. Although Hajime felt a little suspicious of them, he shrugged his shoulders and let it go.

“Did you buy all the necessary things?”

“… … Nn, don’t worry.”

“That’s right. There’s also a lot of food, but it was okay. It truly is convenient to have Treasure Box.”

For shopping, Hajime entrusted the “Treasure Box” to them. Having seen Shia look at the ring enviously, Hajime could only reveal a wry smile. With his current proficiency, he was still unable to make “Treasure Box”. It surely would be convenient, when he is capable of crafting it, he would definitely give it to them.

“Well then, Shia. This is yours”

While saying that, Hajime passed Shia a cylindrical object with 40 cm in diameter and 50 cm in length. A silver cylindrical object with a handle installed on its side.

Shia who received the gift from Hajime, was immediately confused when she felt the weight and activated her body strengthening.

“Wh-what is this? It’s really heavy…”

“Well, it’s because that’s your new Sledgehammer. It is good for it to be heavy”

“Heh, this… … is?”

Shia’s doubt was justifiable. The cylindrical object did not look like a hammer at all, and the handle was also too short. No matter what was said, it was unbalanced.

“Aa, that’s the standby state. For now, try to pour some magic into it”

“Umm, like this? kh!?”

As he said, she poured magic into the hammer-like thing, ‘kashun! kasun!’, sounds of machinery emitted from the hammer and the handle extended, it became the right length for a swing mallet.This Sledgehammer was an artifact : Doryukken (named by Hajime). It was equipped with some gimmicks that could be used by Shia. It operates by transforming the parts of the weapon that have magic poured into.

What Hajime wanted to finish was this weapon. When Yue and Shia went shopping in the morning, he was making Shia’s new weapon.

“This is the limit of the current me, I’ll revise it again when my ability improves, because we don’t know what will happen from now on. Although you received Yue’s training, it was only for ten days. It’s still dangerous for you. That’s why that weapon was made while thinking of how to make use of your power to the maximum. Please master it, okay? Because you have become our companion, don’t die without my permission, understand?”

“Hajime-san… … fufu, your speech is all over the place~. It’s okay. Although I am still not strong enough, I’ll follow you anywhere!”

Shia was so happy while embracing Doryukken. Because she was so happy, Yue who felt a little ill-humored by it, thought to herself that it couldn’t be helped, and shrugged her shoulders. Hajime only showed a wry smile. Although he didn’t say it, to witnessed a scene where a beautiful girl was happy because she got a Sledgehammer as a present, he felt it was surreal.

With the joyous Shia in their company, they finished checking out from the inn. Even now, they ignored the inn girl who looked at them with blushing cheeks.

When they got outside, the sun was already at its zenith, and its brilliant shine fell on and warmed them. With his arms spread, Hajime took a deep breath. When he turned around, Hajime could see Yue and Shia were also smiling.

Hajime nodded to the two, and started to advance, followed by Yue and Shia.

It was time to travel again.

Volume 5 Chapter 3


A heap of corpses.

Those words fit the current spectacle inside the Raisen Grand Canyon’s ravine. Some demonic beasts had their heads smashed, along with the ground. While some demonic beasts had theirs pulverized, furthermore some demonic beasts had their body carbonized, although there were various killing methods, all of them died in one attack.

Naturally, inside this hell, the place that was feared as an execution ground by people, there were…

“One hit certain kill~!”

ZUGANn!!

“… … Hindrance”

GOBANn!!

“Shut up”

DOPANn!!

It was the trio of Hajime, Yue, and Shia. After Hajime and his party got out from the town of Brook (with Yue and Shia’s fans seeing them off), using the magic-driven two-wheeler, they passed through the entrance of “Raisen Grand Canyon”. Currently, after advancing further and camping along the way, they had already passed through the cave concealing the path to “Orcus Great Dungeon”, furthermore two days had passed since then.

Inside “Raisen Grand Canyon”, the demonic beasts kept attacking them just as usual.

Shia’s Sledgehammer, swung with immense force smashed demonic beasts, it was literally a one hit certain kill. The demonic beasts were crushed to death with a normal attack that far exceed their defense. Even the mochi pounding moon rabbit’s destructive power paled in comparison to this.

Yue closed in on the demonic beasts, then slaughtered them with magic that she instantly invoked with magical power from her equipment. Although Yue herself has enormous magical power, equipped with magical power stored inside the accessories called magic crystallization stone series, it became even more enormous. Her attack could be compared to endless bombing. Even if magical power was disintegrated in the ravine, thus the time to invoke magic became longer and the distance became shorter, she invoked ultra high temperature flames in no time and demonic beasts were killed while being carbonized without exception.

Hajime, needless to say, was sniping the heads with Donner while driving the magic-driven two-wheeler. Although it was consuming his magic to use “Lightning-clad” and driving the magic-driven two-wheeler at the same time, there is no sign of magic depletion.

The hell beasts that dominate the ravine were completely treated as small fish. The annihilation was treated as a side job while they searched for a sign of the Great Dungeon. The demonic beasts’ corpses overflowed on their way.

“Haa~, even though it should be somewhere inside the Raisen, it was too vast after all”

They moved while examining if there were caves. Even though they made thorough observations, not even one was found. Hajime could only inadvertently complain.

“Well, because no matter what happens we’ll reach the Big Volcanic Mountain, it’s okay to not find it at all. There might be some clues in the Big Volcanic Mountain after all”

“Well, even if that’s so…”

“Nn… … but, those demonic beasts made it gloomy”

“A~, Yue-san also dislikes this place~”

While complaining and being disgusted by the demonic beasts that keep coming, they had kept traveling for three days. There are no results today and the dark had already set in. The beautiful shine of the crescent moon could be seen if you looked up, therefore Hajime and his party started to prepare their camp. After taking out the tent, they prepared dinner with ingredients and seasoning bought in the town. The tent and cooking utensils were artifacts Hajime made.

The tent was created using Creation magic, with “heating stone” and “cooling stone” installed, it’s always kept at a comfortable temperature. It’s also equipped with “refrigerator” and “freezer” made with cooling stone. Furthermore, the metal frame was imbued with “sign interception” from the “mind-severing stone” so that it wouldn’t be found easily by enemies.

For cooking utensils, there was a frying pan and kettle with an adjustable flame that was proportionate with the amount of magic used, and a kitchen knife endowed with “wind claw” in its sharp edge that could be activated by pouring in magic. There was also a steam cleaner-like thing. They were Hajime’s beloved children that help provide the meals on their travel. Moreover, because it could only be used using direct magic manipulation, it could be said that there was a crime prevention system.

“Age of gods magic is truly a convenient one”

Those were the words that Hajime said when he made the cooking utensil artifacts and the tent installed with a heating and cooling system. It’s just like a useless technology, that wasn’t that useless, that he uselessly refined.

By the way, today’s dinner was kururu chicken simmered in tomato. Kururu chicken was a chicken that was capable of flying in the sky. Its meat’s quality and taste was just like chicken, a popular type of chicken meat of this world. It was a dish where the meat was cut into bite size pieces and floured. after that it was sautéd, then boiled along with various vegetables in a tomato soup. It has the right flavor of butter and meat juice inside the meat, you could feel the tomato’s sourness permeate in your nose when you smell it, when you put it into your mouth, the flavors will spread through. The meat will ‘horohoro’, crumble inside your mouth, ‘hokuhoku’ the potato(fake) that’s completely soaked inside the tomato soup, while carrot(fake)’s and onion(fake)’s sweetness transmitted to your tongue. To have bread melt and soften after dipping it inside the delicious soup truly made it more delicious.

Dinner was finished with full satisfaction. and while immersed in the lingering taste, Hajime and his party chatted just like they always do. Inside the tent, they could leisurely chat because the mind-severing stone was activate, which made it so that demonic beasts do not approach them. Although sometimes there were demonic beasts that came near, Hajime only needed to stick his hand out the window that installed, and shoot it. Moreover, when time for sleep, the three rotated the lookout duty until morning came.

Today, it was about time for Yue and Shia to start preparing to sleep. The first on look out was Hajime. Because there were fluffy futons inside the tent, they could sleep comfortably despite it being a camp. Also, Shia went outside the tent before getting into the futon.

To Hajime who was dubious of what happened, Shia said with a calm face.

“For a while, I wanted to pick flowers”

“There are no flowers inside the ravine, you know?”

“Ha-ji-me-sa~n!”

Hajime’s words that lacked delicacy destroyed Shia’s calm face, she angrily stared at him. Hajime who obviously knew what those words meant said, “My bad my bad”, with a wryly smiling face that didn’t show any remorse. Shia hurriedly went to the tent’s side in anger, after a while…

“Ha-Hajime-sa~n! Yue-sa~n! It’s an emergency! Please come he~re!”

Was what Shia shouted out, forgetting the possibility of demonic beasts hearing it. Wondering what happened, Hajime and Yue, who came from the tent, looked at each other then dashed out at the same time.

When they arrived at the origin of Shia’s voice, they saw that there was a huge monolith that leaned on the ravine’s wall after it fell, and a space was revealed between the monolith and the wall. Shia was inside that space seeing something unbelievable! Being colored in excitement all the while.

“Here, over here! I found it!”

“I understand, for the time being get out of there. It looks like you used full body strengthening. Aren’t you too excited?”

“… … annoying”

The frolicking Shia was pulled out by Hajime and Yue’s hands, when Hajime pulled her he got a feel, while Yue gloomily frowned because of that. Guided by Shia into the crevice between the rocks, when they entered the wall’s side had a hollow interior, and it was wider than expected. Having entered that space, Shia silently, with a proud expression ‘bishi’, pointed her finger at the wall.

Hajime and Yue looked at the place pointed by that finger, then they inadvertently let out “Ha?”, while blinking their eyes in surprise.

In front of the two, in that place, there was a splendid rectangular signboard that was made with cuts in the wall, and strangely woman-like characters were carved there.

“Please come in! Into Miledi Raisen’s thrilling Great Dungeon?”

The mark “!” and “?” felt strangely irritating.

“… … the heck is this”

“… … what is this”

Hajime and Yue’s voice came out in succession. “I am seeing something unbelievable right now!”, were the exact presentations of their expressions. The two of them, blankly looked at the signboard inside the hellish ravine.

“To ask what, it is the entrance! Great Dungeon’s! It was found by chance when I went to-… …cough, to pick flowers. Well~, it was real, there is a Great Dungeon inside Raisen Grand Canyon”

While Shia’s slaphappy voice resounded, maybe because Hajime and Yue was finally able to get out of their surprise, they wore indescribable expressions, then looked at each other in perplexion.

“… … Yue. Do you think it’s real?”

“… … … … … … … … … … Nn”

“That’s a long pause there. Your basis?”

“… … Miledi( …)”

“It was that after all…”

“Miledi”, it was the first name of Raisen that appeared on Oscar’s memorandum. Although the name Raisen was conveyed and known by the world, the first name was unknown. Therefore, the chance that a place with its name signed in was the Great Dungeon of Raisen is very high.

But, no matter what, what they were honestly unable to believe was…

“Why must it be this character…”

There was a reason for saying that. Hajime was considering the desperate fights that happened inside the Orcus Great Dungeon, and surely the other dungeons would also be along that line, that’s why the light-heartedness of this made him lose his strength. Yue also understood well the severity of a Great Dungeon, that’s why, her expression said that she still thought maybe it was someone’s prank.

“But, the entrance-like place couldn’t be seen, right? The interior was a dead end…”

Not noticing what happened in Hajime and Yue’s minds, Shia thought, I wonder where the entrance is? And was looking around the surrounding, then she ‘peshipeshi’, hit the hollow part of the wall.

“Oi, Shia. Don’t…”

GAKONn!

“Fukya!?”

“Don’t carelessly move around,” were the words Hajime was unable to finish when part of the wall that Shia touched ‘GURUNn’, suddenly rotated, and Shia disappeared to the other side of the wall. It was like a door mechanism inside a ninja’s house.

“”… …””

The credibility of that signboard miraculously increased with the finding of the entrance of the Great Dungeon. The Great Dungeon of Raisen was here after all. Even though they had a mountain of complaints such as, “Is this really okay for a Great Dungeon?” and “Give me my seriousness from Orcus back”, something like that after seeing that amusement-like invitation. Hajime and Yue who saw Shia silently disappear behind the rotating door, once more, looked at each other then let out sighs, and put their hands onto the rotating door just like Shia.

Having activated the door, Hajime and Yue were sent to the other side just like Shia. The inside was pitch black, and the door was ‘gururi’, rotated back to its former position. And, at that time,

Hyu Hyu Hyu!

Sounds of something coming flying at them resounded, while they couldn’t see anything inside the darkness. Hajime immediately used “Night Vision” and discovered what they were. They were arrows. Countless arrows painted jet black so as to not reflect light, and they came flying to remove any intruders that entered.

Hajime, with Donner in his right hand, used his left hand to beat down those flying jet black arrows. ‘Kan Kan Kan’, the sound of metal knocking metal came out, without missing even one arrow.

When counted, there were 20 arrows. Jet black arrows made of metal and didn’t reflect any light scattered on the ground, when the last arrow was knocked down, silence returned.

At the same time, the surrounding walls began to shine. The area Hajime and his party were in was a room with a length of 10 meters in every direction, and straight ahead, a passage into the interior appeared. In addition, there was a lithograph inside the room with words with the same characters as the signboard carved on it.

“Did you get scared? Hey, did this scare you? Then you’re a kid, Niya Niya”

“Or, were you injured? Or did someone die? … … bufu—”

“” … …””

Hajime and Yue couldn’t think of anything but one thing. That was “How annoying~”. Also, the “Niya Niya” and “bufu-” part that were carved with emphasis as if to provoke them, made them even more irritated. Especially, if someone in their party truly died, then surely the survivor would curse the heaven.

Hajime and Yue were so irritated that many veins popped out on their heads. Then, suddenly, Yue muttered something she just remembered.

“… … Shia?”

“Ah.”

Having heard Yue’s mutter, Hajime finally remembered, then looked back at the rotating door in panic. Because the door only did one rotation at a time, for her to not be here means the possibility that she got out at the same time Hajime and Yue entered were high. It made him feel something unpleasant because even though a lot of time had passed she didn’t enter, so Hajime immediately activated the rotating door.

Shia was… … there as expected. Her form sewn on the rotating door.

“Uu, sob, Hajime-san… … please don’t look~, but, I want you to take these out. Hic, please do it without looking at me~”

It truly was a pitiful appearance. Shia, although unable to see the arrows that came flying, she probably used her natural search ability to somehow manage to dodge them from the sound. However it seemed it was truly last second, with her clothes pierced here and there, she made a pictogram similar to those that were drawn on emergency exits. Her rabbit ears bent into something similar to a lightning bolt to avoid the arrows, because she knew that she had done something impossible, her body still twitched even now. Most of all, Shia didn’t cry out of fear of death. The cause was… … her feet were magnificently wet.

“Now that I remember, you are going to pick some flowers… … well, what to say. You only did the necessary…”

“Wrong! Uu~, just why didn’t you finish that, the past me~!!”

It was an appearance that you’d never want to show as a woman, even more so for Shia who cried because she had shown it to the man she fell for. Her rabbit ears completely hung down. First of all, even if it was a chance to encounter love after 100 years, Hajime thought it was already too late. That’s why, without looking away he stared at her in amazement. And, that hollowed Shia’s heart even more.

“… … Don’t move”

Maybe because she was also a woman, Yue’s expressionlessness contained sympathy and she released Shia from the crucifixion.

“… … I’ll do something about it. You’re still a novice”

“I am ashamed~. Sob”

“… … Hajime, change of clothes”

“Here”

Shia’s change of clothes were pulled out from the “Treasure Box”, then she did a quick change while blushing.

Finally, Shia’s preparations are finished, “It’s time to conquer the Dungeon!”, was the enthusiastic shout that she let out, only to notice the lithograph.

She looked down and her hair concealed her expression. Shia was silent for a while, then she slowly took out Doryukken, and struck the lithograph with all of her might. ‘Gogya’, was the sound that resounded accompanied with the destruction of the lithograph.

Maybe because she was unable to endure it anymore, she magnificently swung Doryukken many many times as if attacking the enemy of her parents.

Then, in the place of the broken lithograph, characters were carved on the ground, it said…

“Sorr~y? This lithograph will automatically be repaired after some time~ Pu-kusukusu!!”

“Mukii— —!!”

Shia was truly enraged and started to swing Doryukken more intensely. The small room was shaken as if a small earthquake happened, the sound of extraordinary impacts were resounding many times.

Watching Shia with a skeptical gaze, Hajime frankly muttered.

“Miledi Raisen, rather than a member of the “Liberators,” she is unquestionably the enemy of humanity”

“… … I absolutely agree on that”

Apparently, the Great Dungeon of Raisen would be a difficult place in a different way than the Orcus Great Dungeon.

Volume 5 Chapter 4


Raisen’s Great Dungeon was a lot more troublesome than they expected.

First, magic couldn’t be used at all. It was because the strength of magic disintegration was far stronger than inside the ravine. For Yue who specialized in magic, this place puts a heavy burden on her. She was unable to use high-ranked magic and her magic’s range of the magic she could use were shortened to their limits here. The farthest she could use them was only five meters. Somehow, the current level of magic she used was enough for combat. However, right now she was incapable of using magic strong enough to deliver a one-hit kill.

In addition, although the amount of magic stored inside the magic crystallization series didn’t decrease much, it couldn’t be used. The consumption rate was too severe after all. Yue was only able to use middle-ranked magic because she was a genius, most people would be unable to do anything.

Even Hajime was greatly affected by it. Special magic that worked by emitting magic outside of the body such as “Aerodynamic” and “Wind Claw” couldn’t be used, Even the output of “Lightning Clad” is greatly decreased. Donner-Schlag’s power also fell below half of the usual, while Schlagen’s maximum power was at the usual level of Donner-Schlag.

Therefore, body strengthening became the most important magic in this Great Dungeon. In Hajime’s party, Shia had become the main star in this stage.

So, the reliable rabbit ears of Hajime’s party…

“I’ll do it, you know… …absolutely, when I reach the dwelling I’ll mess it up so much it’ll be as if a storm had gone through”

With Doryukken on her shoulder, she examined her surroundings as if she was trying to find her prey. Her anger was obvious. It was a deep deep anger. Even her words’ intonation had become strange. The cause was, you could imagine it came from Miledi Raisen’s mischievousness.

Because they understood Shia’s feelings well, Hajime and Yue couldn’t say anything about it. It was because if there was someone who was seriously agitated, by her side there would be someone calm in reverse of her. It was the current psychological state of Hajime and Yue. Currently, while Hajime and his party continued their advance, they had encountered various traps and annoying carved words. That’s why, with Shia who was truly enraged by it, Hajime and Yue also felt irritated.

Finally, “Fuhihi”, strange laughter came from Shia’s side, and Hajime recalled the extremely malicious things they encountered to get here.

* * *

After Shia destroyed the annoying lithograph, Hajime and his party continued their advance into the passage, and came into a certain vast space.

Inside, there were staircases and passages, the passageway that continued from the entrance was a mess without any regularity, it was as if this place was made by casually combining lego blocks. The staircase from the first floor was connected to a passage on the third floor, and the passage on the third floor gradually became a slope that connected to the first floor’s passageway. While the staircase that was erected on the second floor was connected to nothing but wall, it was truly a mess.

“Once again, in a way it was truly a dungeon-like place.”

“… … Nn, it is confusing.”

“Fun, as expected of a dungeon made by a rotten person. This mess is an expression of her mind’s contents.”

“… … because we understand what you feel, it’s about time for you to calm down.”

Shia was enraged even now. Hajime, half-sympathized and half-amazed, said, “Well then, how should we advance now”, while thinking about it.

“… … Hajime. Even if you think about it, there’s no other method.”

“Nn~, well, you’re right. For now, let’s advance while marking and mapping the way.”

“Nn…”

Hajime nodded at Yue’s words. Mapping was the basic thing for exploring a dungeon. However, Hajime unconsciously frowned when he thought how troublesome it’d be to accurately map out a complex dungeon like this.

Also, what Hajime meant by “marking” was using a special magic called “Tracking.” This special magic operated by leaving a “mark” made of magical power on the places that he touched. When the “mark” was used on living things, Hajime was able to track where they moved. In case of this place, Hajime put his “mark” on the wall. Because the “mark” could be made visible, Yue and Shia were able to understand it. Maybe because the magic power was applied directly, the disintegration didn’t seem to take effect.

Hajime immediately put a “mark” on side of the passageway on the nearest place to the entrance and continued to advance.

The passageway was two meters wide, and made from countless blocks that looked like bricks. Because the walls emitted a faint light, there was no problem with their vision. Maybe it was made of a different material from the green-light stone because it gave off bluish lights.

When Hajime tried to see it using “Mineral Appraisal,” he found that it was called “phosphorous ore.” Apparently it gave off light when it came in contact air. The first room didn’t give off light probably because it was the first room. The image that came out of the cave was lapu** where the levit

*** stone appeared. There was an old man’s voice that came out of the stone. After all, the phosphorous ore would keep radiating light as long as it was in contact with air.

It was the masterpiece anime of Japan that Hajime unintentionally thought of while advancing in the long passageway. Suddenly,

GAKONn

The sound came out of one of the blocks that Hajime stepped on. That block sunk into the floor due to Hajime’s weight. Hajime and his party instinctively let out, “Eh?”, and looked at their feet.

At that moment,

Shaaaaa!!

The sound of gliding blades resounded, and in the space between blocks on the wall, giant saw-toothed blades come out rotated in high speed while vibrating. The blades approached them with height of the neck from the right, the one from the left wall at the height of the waist.

“Evade it!”

Hajime immediately shouted, and evaded it by leaning his back just like the protagonist from the matr**, while the two behind him also tried to evade. Yue was small in the first place so she only needed to squat down to evade. Shia also seemed to be able to evade it. From his back, “Hawawa, hawawawa”, a shaken voice could be heard. Because there was no pain in her voice, Hajime guessed she must be unharmed. Although it was truly at a hair’s breadth that the tip of the fur of her rabbit ear was cut… … it was not a problem at all.

The two blades that were filled with murderous intent and malice were unable do anything to Hajime and his party, and disappeared into the walls. Being vigilant of a possible second wave, for a while Hajime watched his surroundings carefully. However, apparently that was the end. Having felt relieved, Hajime let out a sigh then looked at his back only to feel a chill.

He dashed out instinctively, to retreat and using the momentum recovered Yue and Shia. Immediately, countless blades fell onto the place where Hajime and his party were in just like a guillotine, and cut the ground as if it was made of butter. As expected, it was rotating in high speed and vibrating just like the blades from before.

Hajime looked at the blades that dropped just a few centimeters ahead with cold sweat. Yue and Shia also stiffened because of it.

“… … it was a completely physical trap. I couldn’t sense it with my Magic Eye.”

Until now, Hajime was able to avoid traps perfectly because they were magic traps. Of all the traps in the Great Dungeon that he had seen, all of them contained magic. That’s why, if it was a magic trap, Hajime’s Magic Eye was able to see through it. Therefore, he had the preconception that it was okay as long as the Magic Eye didn’t react to something. In short, he overestimated his power.

“Hau~, I-I thought I was dead~. Rather, Hajime-san! Please stop it if it was just that much! Isn’t that why you have the artificial arm?!”

“Well, don’t you think those blades were sharp? Even if it won’t be able to cut it, there might be scratches. After all, I can’t use Vajra now.”

“S-scratches… … between equipment and me, which is more important!?”

“… … well, you’re safe after all. Isn’t that good.”

“Wa-, what’s with that topic evasion! That was a lie, right? I am the one that’s more important, right? Right?”

Shia tried to ask Hajime, who played her for a fool, and Yue added verbal abuse to the current Shia.

“… …Keaking rabbit. You’re dying because of your own inexperience.”

“Le-leaking, please take that back, Yue-san! No matter what, that was a disgrace for me!”

A new disgraceful title added to Shia’s ”

*** rabbit” series, while Shia endured it with protest. Having entered this dungeon, although she almost died twice in short succession Shia was unexpectedly energetic. As expected, Shia’s forte was taking hits. Even though the person herself won’t admit it.

It was as Shia complained, there were other choices to evade the surprise attack, after all Hajime should be able to stop those blades from a while ago with his artificial arm. His coat’s also made from the leather of a demonic beast that boasted defense, and there were protectors underneath to guard the vital points, that’s right he wouldn’t have died from something like that.

However, the trap just now was nothing but overkill if it was against normal humans. If it were a normal protector, it’d be easily cut in two. After all, if you didn’t have the equipment that Hajime made from the materials that he’d gotten from the Abyss, there was no other way to survive than to avoid it.

“Well, there is no problem if it was that much”

While watching Yue and Shia’s quarrel with skeptical eyes, Hajime told that to himself. No matter how powerful, if it was just physical traps then it wouldn’t be able to kill Hajime. Yue also had her “Auto Regeneration.” She wouldn’t die over a trap. In other words… …Shia was the only one in danger. Even though he didn’t know if Shia had noticed that, it was probably because Shia’s stress level had reached the heavens.

“Huh? Hajime-san, what’s with those pitying eyes…”

“Please live strongly, Shia…”

“Eh, ee? What are you suddenly saying? Although I could felt something very unpleasant from it…”

* * *

Hajime and his party advanced while being wary of traps.

Even now, they hadn’t seen even one demonic beast. Although they considered the possibility that this dungeon didn’t have demonic beasts in it, that was just optimism. It wouldn’t be strange if they suddenly appeared, because that’s also a form of a trap.

Hajime and his party reached an open space after exiting the passageway. The roads were split into three inside the room. For now, Hajime put down the “mark”, then Hajime and his party chose the leftmost passage that lead to a staircase that went down.

“Uu~. somehow I got a bad feeling about this. Look, my rabbit ears restlessly move from left to right.”

Having advanced a few step on the stairs, suddenly, Shia blurted that out. Just as she said, Shia’s rabbit ears stood upright, then began to move left and right.

“You, don’t raise any strange flags now. If you say something like that, usually, something will immediately “GAKON“… see!

“I-It’s not my fault!?”

“… …Flag rabbit!”

While Hajime and Shia talked, an unpleasant sound resounded, and suddenly the stair’s steps disappeared. It was a considerably inclined staircase, and with the disappearance of the steps it became a slope. Moreover, tar-like slippery liquid began to overflow from the countless small holes on the surface.

“Kuh, this—!”

When the steps became a slope, Hajime immediately transmutated the minerals on the bottom of his shoes into spikes, his artificial arm’s fingers were also made into spikes so that he wouldn’t slip down. Yue immediately jumped to Hajime before she started to slip. Hajime who read that also braced himself. As expected, they were harmonized even in this place.

However, there was still one more person who was unable to do that kind of cooperation. It goes without saying that it was Shia.

“Ukyaaa!?”

When it became a slope, Shia raised a scream then the back of her head hit the surface hard. “Nuuaa!”, as she writhed in pain, then slipped along while covered in that liquid. In that state, with her legs opened in a M character, she collided with Hajime’s face.

“Bu!?”

The spikes on his artificial arm came off because of the impact, Hajime was overturned backward with his left arm holding Yue. Then the spikes on his feet also came off, he slipped down the slope headfirst. Shia was on top of Hajime with a reversed position.

“You! Clumsy rabbit! Move now!”

” I am sorry, but to move-~”

While slipping, their speed became faster. Hajime desperately tried to stab the spikes on his artificial arm and shoes on the ground, but they were too fast, so it didn’t go well. Then, he tried to transmute the staircase but with the strong disintegration inside the dungeon, it also didn’t turn out well.

Shia, while struggling was somehow able to get up. Now, it was as if she was riding Hajime.

“Use Doryukken’s stake!”

Hajime gave an instruction to Shia. The Sledgehammer Doryukken that Shia carried had a few gimmicks prepared inside, one of them was to form a stake on the head part of the hammer. It was a mechanism to raise the penetrative power by focusing on one spot. If that was stabbed on the surface they should be able to stop.

“Y-yes, leave it to me!? Hajime-san! The road—!”

Shia tried to remove Doryukken from its fastening/holding device on her back. Then, Shia who looked forward immediately raised an uneasy voice.

Hajime was able to realize what had happened. When Shia slipped before, it was likely dropped.

“Kh! Yue!”

“Nn!”

Hajime immediately called out Yue’s name. Even with only that Yue was able to read Hajime’s intentions.

“Shia, hold on tight!”

“Y-yes!”

While still riding Hajime, Shia tightly clung to him.

Finally, they reached the end of the slope and they were thrown in the air. One moment of weightlessness/floating. At that chance, Yue invoked her magic.

“”Soar”!”

It was an elementary-ranked magic of wind system. It magic created a strong vertical updraft, and it’d increased one’s jumping power. An expert would be able to make pseudo-flight using this magic. However, in this place magical power was hard to maintain. That’s why, Yue’s magic only lasted for a few seconds and its effect only made Hajime and his party float.

“It’s enough.”

Hajime’s voice that was mixed with praise resounded. That’s right, for Hajime, it was enough if he got the time to confirm their surroundings. Yue completely and splendidly answered his expectations.

Hajime, with Yue on his left arm, and Shia clinging to his neck, hung his artificial arm toward the ceiling. Then, he poured his magic power…

PASHU!

A sound come out along with a thin wire with an anchor installed on it and shot out from his artificial arm, it pierced the ceiling’s wall. Then, because of the anchor they were fixed to their place.

Hajime and his party were currently hanging with one wire that hung on the ceiling, they felt relieved after confirming the anchor did not come off.

Then, they felt regret when they saw what was under them.

Kasakasakasa, washawashawasha, kiikii, kasakasakasa.

Those sounds came from a lot of scorpions wriggling around. Its length around 10 cm. Although it didn’t give off the same feeling as that scorpion-look-alike, it gave them the psychological feeling of disgust. If they didn’t halt their fall with the anchor, they would dive into a sea of scorpions, and it gave them goosebumps all over their bodies when they thought that.

“”” … …”””

The trio fell into silence. Because they didn’t want to look below, they looked at the ceiling. Then, somehow they noticed lights emitting into some characters. It was already too late, Hajime and his party inadvertently read it.

“These guys doesn’t have lethal poison.”

“But, you’ll be paralyzed.”

“Please be satisfied by lying with these cute children, pugya—!!”

Maybe she purposely set up these phosphorus ores there, those characters were standing out in the dim space. Those who fell here would surely, with scorpions wriggling around their body, desperately try to move, and try to reach out to heaven (ceiling). Then, they’d discover it. Those playful words.

“”” … …”””

Once again, Hajime and his party fell into silence but because of something else. “Ignore it, ignore it”,was what they told to themselves, and somehow they were able to observe their surroundings.

“… … Hajime, over there.”

“Nn?”

Because Yue noticed something, she pointed her finger to a certain place below. There was an empty tunnel.

“A tunnel… … what should we do? Are we going to climb up to our previous location or are we going over there?”

“I-I will follow Hajime-san’s decision. I have been nothing but a burden after all…”

“No need, the punishment will come from the dungeon, so don’t mind it.”

“That only makes me even more anxious! Isn’t it better to just say “don’t mind it”~”

“… …Impudent. The punishment will become twice.”

“Wh-wha, Yue-san also joined him!? Uu, even if the dungeon is conquered, the future looks dark.”

Hajime and Yue forgave Shia who lamented.

“Haa, no matter, what would be useful is if we could use your “chosen future”~”

“Uu, that was still. Although I’ve been practicing…”

“Chosen future” was Shia’s special magic. It was able to catch a glimpse of the future under some assumptions. However, it can only be used once a day, it was impractical because this special magic required large amounts of magic power to use. Even though Shia specialized in body strengthening, if her magic power drained she’d only be a shameless rabbit. Although the amount of consumption was decreasing because of daily training… … it was still a long way from mastering it.

“Well, it can’t be helped if we can’t use it. Rather than returning, it feels better to advance, so let’s go to the tunnel.”

“… … Nn”

“Yes.”

Hajime shot out another anchor then moved just like tarzan until they safely reached the tunnel.

Hajime and his party advanced in the passageway that was lit by phosphorus ores while being vigilant about any unpleasant traps that might appear.

Volume 5 Chapter 5


At the doorway of a certain passage. You’d noticed that somehow there were only walls in the passage. Normally, one would see it as a dead end. However, some parts of the walls were actually connected to a room from several minutes ago.

Silence lingered in the air, immediately, sparks started to appear from the dead end-like wall, and a hole where people could pass through in a half-crouching position appeared. Creeping out of it were…

“Zehah zehah, hu-hurry it up.”

“… …Nn, it’d be troublesome to be crushed by this.”

“Well, I don’t think that was at a level where you’ll only feel troubled, right? Wouldn’t you normally die from it?”

It was the trio of Hajime, Yue, and Shia. Hajime and his party were wandering around after escaping via the tunnel inside the scorpions’ room. Then, they arrived at a room that had a standard trap where the ceiling dropped down and crushed them.

They were unable to escape the room because the range was too vast. Immediately, Hajime and Shia used their backbones to support the ceiling, and with that chance he used transmutation to make a hole in the ceiling.

Most of all, transmutation was becoming harder to use because of strong magic disintegration in this place, the speed of transmutation became a quarter of the usual, and the range only one meter, while the amount of magic consumption became tenfold the usual. That’s why, Hajime only managed to transmute a small space just enough to hold three people, and they moved toward the exit.

“Damn, even “High-speed magic recovery” was useless. The amount of recovered was too small”

“… … for now, do you want to drink… … recovery potion?”

“Now now, please drink your full~”

“You guys, somehow you have too much composure…”

Hajime who felt a little tired, sat while leaning on the wall, Yue held the gesture of feeding someone chocolate, while Shia got the magic-recovery potion from her pouch. Although it was possible to use the magic crystallization stone to replenish his magic, while it was convenient to get magic power from it, he wanted to preserve it. Furthermore in this situation it was more appropriate to use a magic-recovery potion.

Hajime who felt that he was in a play, as a salary-man with Yue and Shia, and thought, “I can’t make any rebuttal on it”, while he received the recovery potion and drink it in a flash. It tasted almost the same as Li**vitan D. Hajime felt the differences in speed and amount of recovery from magic crystallization stone was significant compared to this, but he could feel that his vitality had recovered a lot. “Ush!”, was how he psyched himself up and stood up.

Once again, they discovered those annoying sentences.

“Pupu—, in a hurry~?, how uncou~th”

Apparently these annoying sentences were a set along with the traps. Miledi Raisen… … was a person who put in a lot of effort to harass someone.

“W-we aren’t in a hurry! Absolutely not! We aren’t that uncouth!”

Having traced Hajime’s gaze, Shia who found those annoying sentences let out, “GRR!”, while protesting toward those characters. It seemed Shia’s hostility toward Miledi already reached the heavens. She reacted every time she found those annoying sentences. Probably, if Miledi was still alive she would have said, “Good prey have come!”, while grinning.

“Ignore that, let’s go. You don’t need to mind that every time.”

“… …What you thought is important.”

“Uu, okay.”

Afterwards, they advanced on the passage, and they reached rooms with other traps waiting. Suddenly, poisoned arrows came from every direction, sulfuric acid-like liquid which melted anything that entered the pitfall, there was also a room where the floor turned into something like an Antlion Nest, with a worm-like demonic beasts in the center of the room, also the annoying sentences. The stress level of Hajime and his party increased at mach speed.

Even so, they passed through all of the traps, and arrived at the biggest passage they had gone through in this dungeon. Its width around 6-7 meters. It gradually became a slope that bent to the right. It was probably a passage that descended in a spiral shape.

Hajime and his party kept vigilant. There was no way that a passage like this didn’t had any traps in it.

After a while, their thoughts proved to be right. An unpleasant sound, “GAKONn!”, of a mechanism could be heard. Immediately, they realized that they hadn’t stepped on or pushed any switches. Then, you didn’t need to use switches before!, was the grand rebuttal that Hajime thought, surely Miledi Raisen would have been happy to hear that as he let out a “Guh.”

What kind of trap is it now?, was what Hajime and his party thought while examining their surroundings vigilantly. Then they heard something.

GOROGOROGOROGOROGOROGOROGOROGORO

It was the sound of something heavy rolling down.

“”” … …”””

The trio went silent and looked at each others, then they looked overhead at the same time. They couldn’t see anything because the slope was curved. The strange noise became louder, then… … a giant boulder as big as the passage rolled down from the curve. The rock was in the form of a big ball. It was a completely standard trap. Surely, after they desperately ran away, those annoying sentences would be there.

Yue and Shia already turned their heels to run away as fast as they could. However, they were immediately stopped. It was because Hajime didn’t move away.

“… …Nn, Hajime?”

“Hajime-san!? Let’s hurry or else we will be crushed!”

The duo called out to him, however Hajime didn’t answer back, then kneeled down while extending his right hand straight forward. His palm hung towards the big ball. Finally, he drew out his left arm with ‘Ghgh’, to the limit, and “Kiiiii!!”, the sound of an activated mechanism resounded.

Hajime watched the approaching, roaring big ball, and his lips transformed into a fierce smile.

“Every time, I won’t always do what you expect! It doesn’t fit my nature!”

From his artificial arm, “Kiiiiii!!”, sound of mechanism became louder along with Hajime’s word.

Then…

GOGAaAAN!!!

A loud sound of something being destroyed emerged when Hajime’s artificial arm met the big ball. The big ball’s force only pushed Hajime back a little, thanks to his spikes, while Hajime’s attacked crushed the big ball at the center when they collided, and it was cracked all over. The big ball’s force disappearing could be seen.

“RAaAAA!!”

Hajime shook his left fist along with the roar. Because the big ball’s durability was barely exceeded by the power of Hajime’s fist, it crumbled, and Hajime’s fist was the victor. A thundering sound could be heard when the big ball crumbled and scattered into tiny pieces.

Hajime draw back his fist while shaking it, then “Fuh”, he stood up. The sound of mechanisms couldn’t be heard anymore from his artificial arm. Hajime observed his artificial left arm to check for any abnormalities while clasping and opening the hand. Then he turned to Yue and Shia.

His expression was truly refreshing. “I did it!”, was the feeling it emitted. It seemed Hajime also couldn’t take it anymore, because he had accumulated too much stress from the traps that he couldn’t detect followed by those annoying words.

What Hajime used this time was the same attack that defeat one of Faea Belgaen’s Elders, a combination of a bullet’s explosive power and “Great Arm,” in addition, he used his artificial arm to invoke vibration magic to crush the boulder, in other words an oscillation fracture. Because of the huge burden, it was only to be used once, normally it was his last resort… … but he couldn’t endure it so that happened.

Hajime, with a satisfied expression, turned around and he was greeted by Yue and Shia who were excited.

“Hajime-sa~n! Just as expected of you! That was so cool! That was so neat!”

“… …Nn, neat.”

“Hahaha, of course, of course. With this, the path…”

Hajime wanted to answer to their praise. However, his words were interrupted.

GOROGOROGOROGOROGOROGOROGOROGORO

They could hear that sound. Hajime’s smile stiffened. Shia also stiffened her smile and the expressionless Yue twitched her cheeks. Hajime turned around with ‘GIGIGI,’ as if he was a machine that was forgot to be oiled and what greeted him was…

— — — — — a big metallic ball that shone with a black luster.

“Lies”

Hajime inadvertently muttered that while having a stiff smile.

“U-umm, Hajime-san. Maybe it was just my imagination, but, somehow that thing also scatters a strange liquid…”

“… …It melts.”

That’s right, the big metallic ball approached them while scattering liquid around that came from small holes on its surface, and places that got splattered with the liquid melted, with a ‘Shuwa—,’ that kind of dangerous sound.

Hajime, after confirming that, “Fuu~”, let out a breath, then faced Yue and Shia with a smile. After that, while smiling he shouted, “Let’s run! Damn it!”, and immediately he splendidly started running to descend the slope, just like a sprinter.

Yue and Shia also looked at each other for a while then, ‘kururi,’ chased after Hajime in a dash.

At their backs, the sound of metal touching the ground along with the dissolution liquid approached them with its speed that gradually increased.

“NOoOOO!! I absolutely don’t want to be melted~!”

“… …Nn, let’s run for now.”

Shia’s lament echoed inside the passage.

“Rather, Hajime-sa~n! Its cruel to run ahead of us! Cold-hearted! Demon!”

Shia protested to Hajime who ran ahead of them.

“Noisy! It’s a calculation error, a calculation error! Just shut up and run!”

“What’s with that excuse! You don’t care if anything happens to me, right!? Uwaa~n, I’ll come to haunt you if I die!”

“… … Shia, surprisingly calm?”

Even while desperately running away, Shia was able to firmly complain, Yue was amazed by it.

They finally saw the end of the passage. He confirmed it with “Far-sight,” apparently it was quite a big and wide space. However, what he saw was a little strange. He couldn’t see the floor of the room even after a long time. Perhaps, the exit of the passage that Hajime and his party were on was on top of the room’s ceiling.

“It’ll be a descent!”

“Nn.”

“Yes!”

Hajime and his party were sliding when they passed through the passage to the room, they descended on the exit.

Then,

“Geh!?”

“Nnh!?”

“Hinh!?”

Three different groans were raised. Right under the exit was a pool filled with an obviously dangerous liquid.

“That bastard!”

Hajime immediately shot out knives from his artificial arm, then used his artificial arm’s anchor, while his right arm caught Yue to prevent her from falling.

At the same time, the metallic ball that scattered around dissoluting liquids dashed out overhead, and fell into the pool before their eyes. It sunk with ‘blub blub,’ sounds, while smoke rose.

“”Wind Wall””

Yue used her magic to disperse the scattered corrosive liquid. For a while, they carefully examined their surroundings and nothing else happened, finally Hajime let his tension leave his shoulders.

“Sob, hic, why only me… … only me… … uu, sob”

Somehow at her side, Shia’s crying voice could be heard, if you look carefully she was stuck onto the wall by having several knives pierce her clothing, pinning her to the wall..

” ? Why did you suddenly cry?”

“… …Emotionally unstable?”

“If you see my current state you should understand. Why was only Yue-san held gently, while I was crucified. Hajime-sa~n, please, can you just be even a little dere to me?”

“Well, didn’t I save you?”

“That’s wrong. I want to be saved in the state that more girl-like… … you understand right!? I wanted to be saved while being held just like Yue-san!”

“… … Shia”

“Sob, what is it, Yue-san?”

“… …Look at the reality”

“What does that mean!?”

“You see, Shia. You’re only our companion, and that’s how I’ll treat you… … Yue is the one I love after all, that’s why it can’t be helped that my body moved on reflex, right?”

“Uu~”

After the justifiable complaint and those justifiable words were said, while ‘pura~n,’ crucified, tears floated on the edge of Shia’s eyes and groaning could be heard. When he said, “the one I love”, Yue’s cheeks were blushing, and while being held by Hajime she rubbed her cheek against Hajime’s chest.

“Absolu~tely, I will make you fall for me and save me by holding me!”

“What a spirited fellow~”

“… …You have the spirit… … I will pay attention to it.”

Under them was the pool of corrosive liquid, while hanging, Hajime and his party still did the love-comedy antic. They were quite composed as expected.

Hajime and his party moved like a pendulum using the anchor, then landed to the ground after jumping over the pool of dissolution liquid.

It was a large rectangular room. On the both side of the walls, there were sets of two meter tall knight armor equipped with large swords and shields. Furthest from the room was a staircase, before that was an altar and there was a door that gave out solemn aura. On the altar was a diamond shaped yellow crystal.

Hajime who looked at that surroundings frowned slightly.

“That was quite a door. Is it Miledi’s hobby? If that’s so then I’ll cheer… … is it only me or aren’t those suits of knight armor giving off a bad feeling?”

“… … it’s okay, it’ll be just like promised.”

“Are they going to attack us? It won’t be absolutely okay after all?”

Hajime and his party advanced toward the center of the room while saying that, surely it was as promised.

The sound that was familiar to them came out.

GAKON!

Hajime and his party immediately halt. They thought, “As expected~”, while looking around at their surroundings, and from the eye slits in the knight’s helmets, ‘GINn’, it shone. Then, ‘gashagasha,’ sounds of metal rubbing each other came when those knights moved from their spot. They numbered 50.

Those knights, raised their shields while wielding their large swords in a piercing stance with their waist slightly lowered. Then, they completed the encirclement.

“Haha, it really is as promised. Although it was okay to destroy them before they moved. Well, there is no need to say… … Yue, Shia, shall we?”

“Nnh”

“A-aren’t they are too many? Well, I’ll do it anyway…”

Hajime pulled out Donner-Schlag. Although Metherai’s machine gun was more effective against such numbers, he didn’t know how many traps were set in this room. The barrage of bullets that shot out indiscriminately would trigger all of them. Therefore, he chose the two railguns.

Yue answered Hajime’s words with a yell filled with fighting spirit. She understood that she had the least fire-power inside this dungeon. However, she would not be a burden. As Hajime’s partner, she won’t lose to something like this. Even more so from now, there would be existences acting as her rivals in love, so she must not show any weaknesses.

On Shia’s side, she lowered her waist a little. This party member was the lowest in terms of influence, but not her power. She knew her battle experience was still considerably insufficient. First of all the battle against demonic beasts in the ravine merely lasted for five days. Even if the mock battle against Yue was included, it was only a little over two weeks of battle experience. Because she also came from the Haulia tribe renowned for their gentleness, it was impossible for her to have a resolute attitude in battle. Rather, it could be said she showed great guts just to hold Doryukken while confronting her enemies.

“Shia.”

“Y-yes! Wh-what is it, Hajime-san”

Shia answered with a nervous voice when she heard Hajime’s voice calling her. His voice was more tender than usual… … or maybe it was just Shia’s imagination.

“You are strong. We guarantee it. You won’t lose against these golems. That’s why, don’t ever think you’re weak. If it becomes dangerous I’ll come to help for sure.”

“… …Nn, it’s my job to take care of my apprentice’s problems.”

Having heard Hajime and Yue’s words, Shia inadvertently became teary eyed. She was simply happy. Although she was treated harshly, when she thought it was because she was a burden, it made her feel uneasy… … it was a needless anxiety. A novice should only do what a novice can do, as best she could. Shia activated whole body strengthening, then she powerfully and firmly stomped on the ground.

“Fufu, Hajime-san is a little dere now. I’m full of motivation now! Yue-san, the day for me to surpass you must be close.”

“” … …Don’t get carried away.””

Although Hajime and Yue said that with amazed looks, Shia who had her tension maxed didn’t hear that. She faced straight ahead and glared at the knights.

“Here I! Come!”

“No, like I’ve said before, how did you get that material… … ah, she’s already gone.”

“… …Daa~”

“… … I won’t refute that. I absolutely won’t refute that”

With 50 Golem Knights in front of him, Hajime carried a tired expression even before the fight began. As if they understood Hajime’s state… … the Golem Knights started to attack the intruders all at once.

Volume 5 Chapter 6


The Golem knights’ movements were agile, despite their large build. ‘Gashah gashah’, was the noise that appeared while they rapidly approached, they gave off intense force along with their glinting weapons. It was as if walls were closing in from all directions.

And Hajime aimed at those golem knights. Even though the two railguns he grasped in his hands were only able to put out power less than half the usual, their power that was still several times that of a real rifle, and was shot at the golem knights.

DOPAN! DOPAN!

Two flashes of light targeted and shot two golem knights’ heads accurately, at the eyes’ parts. The knights fell on their backs from the impact to their heads. When the next set of knights drew near, Hajime lightly jumped. Then he shot them in rapid succession, and the lethal encirclement was thrown into disarray.

Having endured Hajime’s storm-like gunfire using shields, large swords, and the bodies of their companions, several knights finally drew near Hajime and his party.

However, that was the gray hair with a blue hue Shia Haulia’s killzone, who had set up her superheavy Sledgehammer in the air. Without any need to talk, with her physical ability strengthened to the limit, she let out a blow that cleared away everything.

“Deeyaaa!!”

DOoGAAAA!!

There was a yell. She brought down her Sledgehammer, Doryukken, with a tremendous impacting sound one of the golem knights was flattened. Although the knight set up its shield beforehand, it defense was still crushed.

There were cracks and a dent on the ground caused by Doryukken. The attack was released with all her might, maybe after it confirmed the dead body, a knight was able to set up its shield and endure the impact, while trying to cut Shia in two with its large sword.

Shia firmly confirmed that with a side glance. Twisting the handle, she adjusted the angle of Doryukken’s head, then pulled the trigger.

DOGANn!!

Such an explosive sound came from Doryukken that was on the ground and it jumped. At Shia’s side a shotshell fluttered after rejecting from its case. While riding on Doryukken’s momentum, Shia rotated in her place and delivered a blow carrying great centrifugal force. The knight that tried to bring down its large sword was hit in its flank.

“Rhaaa!!”

She let out a shout filled with vigor. The knight that received the direct hit had its body bent, as if it was run over by a speeding truck, it magnificently rolled to the back and hit the other approaching knights. The knight’s body, because it was unable to stop itself, was squashed and did not gave any sign of movement.

Hyun Hyun

That sound of wind entered Shia’s rabbit ears. When she took a peek at it, it was a large sword that the golem knights had raised, it was rotating mid-air after having parted from the knight. Shia jumped and grabbed the large sword, and then with all her might, she threw it at the oncoming golem knight.

The large sword flew with great velocity, and when it collided with the shield that the golem knight had set, the shield was flipped. Not missing that chance, Shia swung Doryukken from below. The golem knight which had a large build received the impact in its abdomen and floated in the air. Although it tried to swing the large sword in desperation, Shia raised Doryukken then using the centrifugal force, clashed with the large sword, and this time Doryukken attacked the floating knight from a lower angle.

Just like the previous golem knight, was blown away like a cannonball and flew at the nearby golem knights, swallowing them with its large build and laid on the ground.

A smile floated on Shia’s lips. It was not like she felt the pleasure of fighting. She was only happy that she could fight properly. She felt that she could continue traveling with Hajime and Yue now. At that moment, she was a little distracted.

On the battlefield, such a thing is fatal. When she’d noticed, a lot of knights’ shields had already drawn near. Somehow, the golem knights decided to throw their shields toward Shia. As expected of golems, they flew with extraordinary power, although it wouldn’t be fatal against Shia’s strengthened body, they have enough power to cause a concussion. If that happens, it’s easy to imagine what’ll happen next.

How careless! Though there was no time to think that, she at least tried to steel herself to endure the incoming attacks. Then, a laser-like water current attacked the shields right before they collided with Shia, and it bent their trajectories. The shields passed by the sides of Shia’s head, then crashed into the golem knights behind her.

“… …Unpreparedness is one’s greatest enemy. Punishment will be thrice the usual.”

“Fue!? Just now, was that from Yue-san? I-I am sorry, also thank you very much! Wait, punishment will be thrice!?”

“Nn… … don’t daydream.”

“Uh, yes! I will try my best!”

With a “Meh!” —like feeling Yue scolded her, Shia was also conscious of her small carelessness. She braced herself while reflecting on it. Once more, she tried to defeat the approaching golem knights. With help from water lasers that flew from behind her back, the golem knight that tried to perform a sneak attack from behind of Shia was confirmed to be cleanly bi-sected.

Shia felt a warm feeling inside her knowing that Yue will protect her back. To not show any disgrace in front of her master, she raised her fighting spirit.

Afterwards, the same water current flew at the knight who tried to go into the rampaging Shia’s blind spot, and cut it just with sharpness keener than blades. What Yue used was middle-ranked magic from water system called “Rupture.” It was a water cutter that fired the moisture in the air at ultra high-pressure.

In Yue’s hands were big metallic water bottles. There were also two other water bottles on her shoulder strap. These were something taken out by Hajime from “Treasure Box.” Every time Yue muttered the magic’s name, water cutter would fly out from the water bottles that she held.

Although Yue was able to use the moisture in the air, she thought it would consume too much magic power to pressurize it from scratch. Moreover, utilizing the exit of the water bottle to aim, the water cutter that came out didn’t contain magic itself, so it wouldn’t affected by the disintegration and disappear.

Shia’s explosive area attack, was supported by Yue’s water blade that covered her blind spots. The knights were incapable of breaking the duo’s combination, and one by one they were destroyed as if being played with.

Hajime who took a side glance to look at Yue and Shia’s splendid cooperation floated a wry smile.

“Oioi, you can do it after all. I wonder if I would also be capable of displaying something good?”

While joking to himself, Hajime started to enter close-combat with Donner-Schlag (…).

He warded off a descending large sword of a knight with Schlag’s barrel, and shot its helmet at zero distance with Donner in his right hand. Without looking at that knight who flew backwards, he warded off an attack from behind with Schlag, and shot the knight behind him without turning around, then he squatted down while rotating to dodge large swords that were swung horizontally, the knights’ hands were intersected and he shot their sides.

A shot that didn’t use “Lightning-clad” ricocheted from the knight’s shield and hit a nearby knight’s knee joint, destroying its balance. And then he jumped up and while reversing his view, he destroyed the knight and another nearby knight at the same time from overhead. He parried large swords aimed at him with the back of his hands, then fired to his side while mid-air and four knights’ heads were shot and crushed at the same time. As he landed, he took the bullets from “Treasure Box,” and reloaded the guns by spinning them, and he resumed shooting while spinning. The surrounding knights were blown away radially.

Doing that, without leaving a chance to be scratched, they slaughtered those golem knights one by one.

However…

“… …?”

While counterattacking the golem knights, Hajime raised his eyebrows in doubt. The reason being that, although a lot of the golem knights were destroyed, there was no change of density that approaching.

It seems, Yue and Shia were also having that doubt. Finally, when they carefully observed the battlefield, the golem knights that they had defeated could not be seen.

“… …Replication?”

“Looks like it.”

“That can’t be!? Then, it won’t end at all!”

That’s right, after the golem knights were destroyed and lost the glint in their eyes, more knights with the same glint and body as those knights were reproduced in no time and rejoined the rank.

Shia raised a panicked voice while mowing down the approaching knights. It was reasonable to say that, after all no matter how many she defeated there was no meaning to it. However, Hajime and Yue were calm, there was no impatience in their expressions as they kicked around the golem knights. This might be what is called a difference in experiences. They had experienced something like this many times in the depths of the Abyss. Naturally, they were stronger now.

“… …Hajime, if it’s a golem then there must be a core”

Just as Yue had said, it was normal for golem to have a core inside its body, and that core was the source of its power. The core was made using demonic beasts’ magic stones. It was written down on blueprint of Oscar’s cleaning golem. What Yue said was to destroy that core.

However, Hajime floated a bitter expression having known Yue’s proposal.

“What can I say, these guys didn’t have a core at all.”

“… … Really?”

“Aa, I have confirmed it using magic eye, there is no mistake about it. Although I was able to find some suspicious magic power from the golem…”

“I-it ended with that after all! It’ll be bad if this keeps up!”

Shia raised her voice filled with impatience. Hajime only let Shia’s shout pass through his ears, then used “Mineral Appraisal.” For golems that operated without core, he wondered, “Are they made using special ore?”

His thoughts were right on the money.

Induction Ore

An ore that naturally induces magic. It was able to establish a connection of magic power between two or more induction ores, using one ore, other ores with an established connection of magic power can be remotely controlled.

These golem knights made using induction stone must have something that acted as a remote control. Although Hajime and his party thought it was replication, it was actually rearrangement by manipulating the ore, they only needed to add to the parts that were insufficient. It’s actually more like reconstructing rather than replicating.

If you looked carefully, you’d notice that the floor was also made using the induction ore, and parts that that appeared to be cut away could be seen. Those were probably used to replenish the parts of the golems. Without defeating the controller, it’d be truly endless.

“Yue, Shia. There must be something that’s controlling them. Because it’s seriously endless, let’s breakthrough them!”

“Nnh.”

“B-breakthrough? Affirmative!”

Under Hajime’s signal, Yue and Shia immediately dashed out toward the altar. Hajime advanced using Donner-Schlag’s rapid-fire against the knights and as they scattered a path was created, two grenades were thrown toward the knights that approached from behind. With a big explosion in the back, the golems knights were felled one after another by the blast and the shockwave.

Shia advanced through the space that Hajime made, while rotating Doryukken, mowing down golem knights all the while. The golem knights were skillfully throwing their shields and large swords at Shia only to have Yue’s “Rupture” come and split them.

Hajime whose duty was to guard the rear, fired his railguns in rapid succession at the golem knights approaching from behind. Using the opportunity, Shia passed through the encirclement and arrived in front of the altar. Next was Yue who arrived in front of the door after jumping over the altar.

“Yue-san! The door-!?”

“Nn… …It was sealed after all.”

“Au, as expected!”

In front of their eyes were the suspicious altar and door. They had guessed it’d be sealed. That’s why, they originally thought it’d be troublesome and decided to slaughter the knights instead. While they resolved to release the seal on the door. Shia complained as usual, which resulted in knights flying in from the stairs.

“I’ll leave the seal to Yue. It’d take too much time to breakthrough it using transmutation.”

Hajime stood beside Shia to look out for her back. Just as Hajime said, to forcibly use transmutation to breakthrough the door, although it might be possible, it’d consume large amounts of magic power in this area, and it’d also take a lot of time. That’s why, having reached the altar with the yellow crystal with so much effort, it was faster to release the seal normally. Hajime who thought so, left the duty to Yue who had bad magic consumption.

“Nn… … leave it to me.”

Yue readily acknowledged that and immediately took the yellow crystal from the altar. That crystal was in a square made of pyramids shape, if you looked carefully it was made from combinations of solid blocks.

Yue looked back at the door behind her. There were three indentations there. Yue thought for a while, then started to disassemble the square of pyramids. She reassembled those blocks to make new cubes that fit the indentations.

While assembling those, Yue observed the indentations in the door. Then, only by carefully observing it she noticed small characters that were carved there. They said…

“I wonder if can you solve it~, I wonder~”

“You’ll die if you don’t do it fast, you know~”

“Well, it can’t be helped if you can’t solve it! You’re just an ordinary human unlike me after all!”

“Don’t worry! Even if your head is bad you can liv-… … you can’t live! How regre~ttable! Pugyaa—!”

They were the annoying sentences as usual. Yue was truly irritated by it. With her usual expressionlessness, she concentrated to solve the puzzle although she wanted to punch the door.

Somehow, Hajime and Shia could feel her anger from her back, and could only curse in their minds while concentrating on destroying golem knights.

“Hajime-sa~n. Please use DOPAh just like before~”

Like a certain black thing from the kitchen, the golem knights swarmed disgustingly, that’s why Shia begged Hajime to use a grenade.

“Idiot. That must be thrown where it was sure no trap was installed. If it was thrown near the stairs, you must know what might happen.”

“You said it now even after it laid waste to the golems before?”

“Well, it was something Miledi Raisen made. Isn’t it possible that it won’t react only against golem?”

“Uu, I can’t refute that…”

In certain ways, Hajime and Shia only played around with the golem knights so they could make idle talk. In the beginning, Shia was truly impatient about it, but when she saw how calm Hajime and Yue were, she calmed down.

“But, it made me somewhat happy.”

“Aa?”

Once more, while smashing a golem knight then making it fly with a kick, Shia blurted that out.

“Just a little while ago, I, who was only capable of running away, was able to fight together with Hajime-san… … it made me so happy.”

“… …You are truly a curious one.”

“Ehehe, I, finally able to flirt with Hajime-san after we capture dungeon ! Yay.”

“Oi, you. How did you connect to that, it’s the same as raising a death flag. To be a tragic heroine will be too much for you, so stop that. Also, I just can’t rebutted it, but you know this material, right?”

“It was, “I absolutely won’t let you die, my honey?”, something like that? Hajime-san, mouh!”

“You twisted it too much! Recently, although I was scared of your positivity… … I don’t have any appropriate remarks for it…”

They kept chatting for several minutes while repelling those knights. In a way, in the space between the two who kept flirting, “nuu~,” a shadow appeared. It was Yue.

“… …Flirting is forbidden.”

“Well, we didn’t do anything like that.”

“Nufufu, is that what it looks like? How embarrassing~”

“It’s better for you to shut up…”

Somewhat, after Hajime look with a side glance at Shia with a tired expression, he turned to Yue who looked a little displeased. However, without re-thinking about this situation, this time she showed a little proud look having done a great achievement.

“… …It’s open.”

“How fast, just as expected of Yue. Shia, fall back!”

“Yes!”

Hajime took a peek behind him, and as Yue said, the seal had released and the door was open. There seemed to be nothing unusual inside the room. Hajime told Shia to withdraw, then he retreated toward the room. The golem knights wouldn’t able to chase after them if they closed the sealed door. Yue was the first to retreat, next was Shia who jumped beyond the door, and because it was a double door they were on standby at both sides to close it.

Hajime threw several grenades as farewell gifts, and dived into the room. Although the golem knights rushed after their escape, they were scattered by the strong impact that came from the grenades. Their balance were destroyed. Without missing that chance, Yue and Shia closed the door.

Inside the room, using farsight it was confirmed that there was nothing at all. Surely, even if it was not Miledi Raisen’s room, there must be some clue leading to it, right?, and that was what they thought while losing their momentum.

“This, isn’t it that? Even though there was a conspicuous seal, there was actually nothing inside, is it that kind of punchline?”

“… …That can’t be”

“Uu, Miledi. How much do you want to take us for a fool!”

The trio were dropped because of that most possible possibility, suddenly, they heard the familiar unpleasant sound.

GAKON!

“”” !?”””

Along with the sound of mechanisms beginning to operate, the room trembled. Then, G came from the side of Hajime and his party.

“Kh!? What happen!? Did the room just move!?”

“… …Looks like i—!?”

“Ukya!?”

At the same time Hajime said that, this time the G came from above. Because of the radical change, Yue may have bitten her tongue as she covered her mouth with teary eyes while trembling. Shia fell from the ceiling in a frog-like pose.

The room continued to change its direction several more times, it was stopped after approximately 40 seconds of ignoring the law of inertia. Hajime was able to endure the impact of a sudden stop by fixing his location using spikes driven into the ground, while Shia who unable to endure it, was rolling around, flying, and hit the back of her head hard against the wall. She rolled over here, she rolled over there, and raised a scream every it changed direction, that’s why her complexion was bad. It was as if she was drunk. She was completely down like a drunk with sharp pain in the back of her head. By the way, since the start Yue was clinging to Hajime’s body so she had no problems at all.

“Fuu~, finally stopped… … Yue, are you okay?”

“… …Nn, no problem.”

Hajime retracted the spikes and stood up. There was no change at all when he observed the surroundings. Considering the movement, the door they entered from should connect to a different place.

“Ha-Hajime-san. Why are there no words for me?”

Shia who cover her mouth with blue face, stared at Hajime. It seems she was displeased because he only asked Yue.

“Well, if I ask the current you it’ll reverse the momentum… … and then you’ll throw-up and get vomiting rabbit as a new title, you don’t want that, right?”

“Of course! Even so, I wanted to be asked because that was a maide— uppu.”

“See, it’s better for you to rest a little now”

“Uu. Uppu.”

Leaving alone Shia who was on all fours that seemed to vomit at any moment, Hajime and Yue confirmed the surrounding. Finally, there was nothing after all and they faced the door.

“Well then, what shall we do?”

“… …Is the one that controlled it there?”

“There is that possibility. Miledi should have died… … then who on earth moved those golem knights.”

“… …No matter who appears, it’s all right. Hajime will be protected by me… … subsequently, Shia too.”

“I can’t hear you~ uppu.”

Hajime smiled, having heard Yue’s typical words. Gently, with one hand he rubbed Yue’s head. Yue who wanted to be spoiled came closer while pleasantly narrowing her eyes.

“… …Even though I remembered saying this before, could you stop suddenly entering into a world of just the two of you? What can I say, to be alienated makes me feel so lonely, uppu.”

While enduring the nausea, “I don’t want to be left out!”, was what Shia expressed while crawling on all fours.

“… …Even though I had also said it before, it still comes out, so could you stop that horror flick-like movement? What can I say, it’d be scary if it appeared in my dreams.”

“T-that’s good. To be beside you even just a little is a maiden’s heart-, uppu. I also wanted to be patted just like Yue-san. Please embrace me and pat me! Ue, uppu.”

“To say that with a face of someone who will vomit at any moment… … moreover to casually add your own demands.”

“… …It is still too early for Shia to be patted by Hajime.”

With her willpower, Shia came to Hajime and Yue’s side, she looked at Hajime with expectant eyes and a pale face. Hajime quietly averted his gaze to face the door. Behind him, “Why! Ueppu”, was the noise that could be heard, but he just let it pass through his ears.

On the other side of the door, will it be Miledi’s dwelling, golem’s controller, or just another trap… … Hajime thought, “Come whatever it is”, while he opened the door with a fearless smile.

There was…

“… …Have I seen it before? This room.”

“… …Certainly. Especially that lithograph.”

Ahead of the opened door was another room. There was a lithograph and passage at the left side of the room. They should have memories of this room. Because, this room was…

“It looks like… … the first room, right?”

Shia thought that even though she said it, she didn’t want to think it was so. However, certainly, just as Shia said there was the lithograph with the annoying sentences carved, just like the first room. But there was a difference from that room. The proof was, after several seconds the door opened, characters floated up from the original room’s floor.

“Nee, right now, how do you feel?”

“Even though you had advanced after much hardships, only to arrive at the starting point, how do you feel?”

“Nee, nee, how do you feel? What kind of feeling do you have? Nee, nee.”

“””… …”””

The expressions of Hajime and his party ‘suton,’ fell from their faces. Their expressions perfectly fit the words ‘Noh mask’. The trio watched as the characters silently and smoothly moved. Then, additional characters started to appear.

“Ah, there is something I forgot to say, this dungeon will be altered at regular intervals.”

“As usual, it was Miledi-chan’s thoughtfulness to make you enjoy the dungeon with a fresh feeling.”

“Are you happy? You are happy, right? There is no need to reward me! I only do it because I like it after all!”

“By the way, because it always changes, mapping it was useless.”

“Don’t tell me, did you make it? With so much hardship? But, sorry! Pugyaa—”

“Ha, hahaha.”

“FUFUFUFU.”

“FUHI, FUHIHIHI.”

The trio let out three different types of broken laughter. Afterwards, needless to say screams were echoed through the entirety of the dungeon. After getting through the first passage, it was just as Miledi said, the stairs were greatly altered along with the differing position of the corridor ahead of them. It goes without saying that they let out resentful voices again because of the structure.

Somehow they manage to regain their spirits, Hajime and his party once again tried to conquer the dungeon. However, it wasn’t a smooth sailing as expected, especially Shia who always triggered the traps (gold basin, bird lime, shots of liquids with strange smell, etc), “weren’t those psychologically dangerous?”, that is to say she became totally enraged, well troublesome things are troublesome after all.

Then, they connected back to the starting scene.

Volume 5 Chapter 7


Inside a certain room, pale light was faintly emitted by the walls, and the shadows of three people close to the wall were cast. It was Hajime, Yue, and Shia.

Yue was on Hajime’s right side, while Shia was on his left, and they sat while leaning against his shoulders. Although silence filled the room, if one focused their ears ‘suu- suu-,’ sounds could be heard. It was Yue and Shia’s breathing. They were both embracing one of Hajime’s arms and slept using his shoulders as a substitute for a pillow.

Today marks one week since Hajime and his party entered the dungeon of Raisen. During that time, a lot of traps and annoying sentences continued to exhaust their bodies and minds. They had been returned to the starting point seven times, attacked by lethal traps 48 times, and other meaningless traps for 169 times. Even though at first their hearts were filled with anger toward Miledi Raisen, after four days had passed it looked like their mental states became, “No matter what appears next, it doesn’t matter~”

They had an abundance of rations, and their bodies’ specs made it so that they wouldn’t easily die were the fortune within their misfortune . Now, they were resting after advancing, searching for clues all the while. As a result, they understood the pattern of the structure alteration. Using “mark,” they were able to confirm where those blocks were repositioned.

There might be additional progress from now on. While he thought that, Hajime turned toward the girls that slept on his sides.

“They sleep so comfortably… … isn’t this a Great Dungeon?”

Hajime’s murmur mixed with a wry smile resounded. He had stayed up for a long time as the lookout. Hajime quietly released his arm that somehow got embraced, and stroked Yue’s hair. A slight smile could be seen. Hajime’s eyes also slightly reverted to their former state.

Next, he changed his glance to Shia on the other side. She splendidly drooled on Hajime’s shoulder while “munya munya,” she moved her mouth, and it truly was a slackened sleeping expression. He remembered that she also wanted her head patted, so he quietly stroked Shia’s hair. Immediately, he felt the rabbit ears’ fluffiness. It was followed by her showing a loosened expression that she doesn’t show even under normal circumstances. It was a truly relieved expression. For the most part, it only occurs when Hajime was on lookout, well, it could be said that she’d feel relieved when Hajime was by her side.

Hajime who gently stroked the blue-hued gray hair, as well as the rabbit ears, showed a complex expression.

“Geez, just what’s good about someone like me… … that you would follow me, even here…”

He looked at Shia with tender eyes while throwing abusive words at himself. The thing that Shia sought could be compared to the feelings that Yue had. Even so, Shia’s positive attitude, cheerfulness, and how she cried but never gave up… … greatly attracted Hajime’s fancy. As a result, his strokes became even gentler. And, at that time, Shia who “munya munya,” started to talk in her sleep.

“Munya… … Au… … Hajime-san, how bold~, to do it outside~, … … everyone will be able to see~”

“… …”

Hajime who looked at her with gentle eyes immediately erased his smile. He gently used both hands, and quietly moved them, to pinch Shia’s nose and close her mouth. Shia’s calm expression gradually changed to a painful one, but he didn’t mind it and kept doing it.

“Nn~, nn? Nnh~!? Nnn–!! Nn–!! Puhah! Haa, haa, wh-what are you doing!? Even though it was an attack while I sleep, it has the wrong meaning!”

Shia who “zeha zeha,” panted, woke up then fiercely protested, Hajime turned toward her with cold eyes.

“Well? Inside your mind, what kind of a pervert am I? What will you do outside? Nn?”

“Eh? … … hah, that was a dream!? Why~, even though Hajime-san finally became dere, it was impossible to suppress the pathos that gushed out, and the bashfulness of me that writhes in agony because of those words, finally decided in publi- hebuh!?”

Without listening to anymore of it, Hajime used strengthening to flick her forehead. Shia became face up because of the big impact, and the back of her head hit the wall behind her, hard; which result in her squatting with teary eyes. As expected, her shameless character always slips out.

While rubbing the back of her head, Shia muttered, “Somehow I felt something happy happened, but is it just my imagination?” Probably, she unconsciously felt Hajime patting her. However, because he had known she would get carried away if he told her the truth, Hajime decided to ignore her.

Because Shia woke up (although by force), Hajime gently shook Yue to wake her up. Yue “… …Nn u… …Au?”, let out that lovely voice while slowly opening her eyes. Then, with a blank expression she looked upward and confirmed Hajime was there, once again, she rubbed her mouth on Hajime’s shoulder, then she quietly parted from Hajime and straightened her appearance.

“Uu, Yue-san is so cute… … this is how a girl wakes up~, compared to her I was…”

Shia began becoming depressed this time, and Yue looked at her in wonder, only to let out an explanation, “because it was Shia after all.”

“Look, from the beginning you understood the overwhelming difference in battle power (girl power), right? Rather than being depressed, start doing some soul searching.”

“… … What gentleness, you didn’t drop it somewhere?”

“… …? Hajime didn’t drop anything like that.”

“Gusuh, only to Yue-san. Damn.”

Shia stood up after some soul searching. Yue and Hajime were also ready. This time, they prayed that they wouldn’t be returned to the starting point, and so the trio resumed their dungeon conquest.

Once again, because there will be a lot of unpleasant traps and annoying sentences, they cleared their mind and soul.

Then, Hajime and his party reached a room that they had only visited once, even after a week. It was the room with golem knights that made them remember how mad they were when they got returned to the starting point the first time. However, this time the sealed door was opened from the start, and inside was not a room but a passage.

“This is… … it’d be troublesome if they encircle us again. Let’s rush to the open door at once!”

“Nnh!”

“Yes!”

Hajime and his party broke into the golem knights’ room at once. When they approached the center of the room, as expected, ‘gashan gashan,’ the sound of golem knights rushing out from the recesses on both sides of the walls resounded. From the start, they ran forward while kicking and shooting those golem knights; which bought them some time, while Hajime and his party ran faster still, to reach the altar before being caught by the golem knights’ encirclement. Although the golem knights rushed after them, they were unable to catch up to Hajime and his party that had already passed the door. Having successfully escaped, Hajime was grinning.

However, Hajime’s smile vanished in the next moment. This time the golem knights also passed through the door, chasing after them. Also…

“Wha-!? They can run on the ceiling!?”

“… … Surprising”

“Gravity-san please do your work~!”

That’s right, the golem knights that chased them, as if ignoring gravity, were running on the walls and ceiling, giving off ‘gashan gashan,’ sounds of moving heavy armor. Because of this, even Hajime and his party were surprised by it. Hajime immediately looked at the passage then used “Mineral Appraisal,” but all materials were already known. He didn’t detect any minerals that could neutralize gravity, or any with adhesive nature.

“How did they do that?”

Those were the unintentional mutterings that leaked out from his mouth. And once more he took a peek at the golem knights behind him, becoming even more surprised as he turned around.

One of the golem knights on the ceiling was running while ‘pyon,’ jumping, and like a cannonball it advanced with tremendous momentum toward them while jumping in mid-air.

“W-wha-!? Shitty bastard!”

Hajime let out a surprised voice then fired Donner rapidly. The bullets fired accompanied by flashes, and the golem knight’s helmet and shoulders were destroyed. The golem knight’s headpiece separated from the body, and the large sword and shield were also dropped. However, without falling to the ground, it advanced toward Hajime and his party as is.

“Evade!”

“Nnh.”

“Wakya!”

They avoided the golem knight’s head, body, large sword, and shield that came fast and furiously by jumping and bending their bodies. The wreckage of the golem knight passed Hajime and his party, flew towards the walls and ceiling without reducing its momentum, and then crashed and rolled around on the floor.

“Oioi, isn’t that…”

“Nn… … it looks like it “fell”.”

“Gravity-san is at work, I understand.”

It was just as represented by Yue’s and Shia’s words. Apparently, those golem knights were able to control gravity. Although no one understood why they didn’t use it last time, probably because previously it was a room, they might be only able to use it after the room changed into a passage.

While making that hypothesis, Hajime and his party were interrupted by golem knights that “fell.” Some of them approached while spinning their large swords as if they were pinwheels in a veteran-like manner. Hajime and his party used gunfire and “Rupture” for ranged attacks, while Shia struck those that drew near, and they advanced without stopping.

After a while, Hajime and his party felt a different presence from those knights.

“Muu… … Hajime.”

“Aa, I know. Because this dungeon can reconstruct itself, it must be something like that.”

“W-we are surrounded.”

After falling golem knights, next was the reconstruction to come down. Hajime and his party decided to wait for the platoon to come. The knights came with shields raised and moved gallanty, as if they had become a wall. The golem knights created a two-row formation, where the knight in the back supported the defending knight in front. Perhaps they had learned that with only a single row they’d be crushed with sheer power.

“Tch, how troublesome.”

While clicking his tongue, Hajime put Donner-Schlag back into their holsters. After that, he took out one weapon from “Treasure Box.”

In his hands was a weapon with rectangular shape and 12 rotating barrels, the Rocket & Missile Launcher : Orkan. The rockets themselves were 30 cm in length, each of them had more destructive power than the usual grenade. Using Creation magic, the warheads were installed with stones that could generate “Lightning-clad,” because these stones constantly generate static electricity, they were cobbled together with combustion powder that’d be ignited by the warhead upon contact.

Hajime was grinning while he fixed Orkan to his side.

“Yue, Shia! Cover your ears! I’ll blow them up!”

“Nn.”

“Ee~ what was that!?”

Shia who saw Orkan’s bizarreness for the first time could only open her eyes wide. Yue was the first to thrust her index fingers into her ears.

Shia’s rabbit ears ‘pinh,’ stood upright; unconcerned, Hajime pulled Orkan’s trigger.

PASHUUU!

Along with that sound, the rocket was launched, leaving trails of sparks behind. It was aimed at the platoon of golem knights that laid in wait, then it hit.

In the next moment a roaring sound came along with a large explosion. The pressure that came from igniting a large amount of compressed combustion powder greatly shook the passage. The golem knights that were in the line of fire and received a direct hit, were violently thrown against the walls on both sides, as well as the ceiling. They were destroyed to the point that they didn’t even resemble their original forms. It’d take a fair bit of time for them to be reconstructed.

Hajime and his party jumped over the wreckage of the fallen golem knights at once.

“Rabbit ears were-~, my rabbit ears were-~!!”

While Hajime and his party ran, Shia folded her rabbit ears and held them with both hands in agony with teary eyes. The Rabbitman tribe had… … the most excellent hearing among the demi-human race after all.

“That’s why I said to close your ears.”

“Ee? What is it? I can’t hear you.”

“… … truly, a shameless rabbit…”

Although Hajime and Yue looked at Shia with amazed expressions, Shia who was in agony couldn’t noticed it.

After dealing with golem knights that had come falling once again, they ran through the passage for five minutes. Finally, they saw the end. Ahead of the passage was a huge and broad room. The road itself was broken, and they could see a square scaffold 10 meters ahead.

“Yue, Shia! Jump!”

Hearing Hajime’s shout, Yue and Shia (who somehow recovered) nodded. At their backs, the golem knights kept coming down. While they tried to intercept, Hajime and his party that kept avoiding them reached the end of the passage and jumped.

The jumping power of Hajime and his party who used body strengthening far outstripped olympic athletes. Hajime and his party easily broke the world record and jumped to the square before them.

But, it was a characteristic of this Great Dungeon that nothing comes out as expected. Somehow, in front of Hajime and his party that jumped, drawing a parabolic arc, ‘shii-,’ the square block began to move.

“Whaat!?”

Hajime raised the shout that he had let out many times in this dungeon. Because the distance they judge was altered, they will fall at this rate. They took a peek below and saw that it was quite deep. When he prepared to shoot out the anchor, Yue’s voice immediately rang out.

“”Soar”!”

Using the updraft from wind magic, Hajime and his party’s jump distance extended. Even though it was only for a moment, it was enough. He somehow succeeded catching the edge of the block that was still moving even now. Using the spikes on his artificial arm to secure him in place, Hajime was hanging with Yue and Shia clinging to him.

“N-nice, Yue.”

“As expected of Yue-san!”

“… … Praise me more.”

While unconsciously smiling because they had avoided the fall, Hajime and Shia praised Yue. Yue who had consumed a large amount of magic power was a little tired, but showed a triumphant mood.

However, that peaceful atmosphere was disrupted by the golem knights that came flying. That’s right, the golem knights were flying in the air. They probably controlled gravity so that they wouldn’t fall. They approached Hajime and his party who were currently hanging, with tremendous momentum.

“kh!? Yue, Shia climb me!”

While issuing that order Hajime took out Donner and rapidly shot at the approaching golem knights. Yue and Shia climbed up Hajime’s body which was still moving along with the block. Then Hajime raised his strength to pull himself onto the block using only one arm. Immediately after, the place where Hajime was previously hanging was pierced with large swords that came hurtling with tremendous velocity. Afterwards, Hajime shoots from overhead the golem knights that were stiffened due to post-skill latency.

“Shit, these guys, I don’t know if it was caused by the gravity control, but their movements and tactics became better.”

“… … Perhaps, the cause is here?”

“Ahaha, what’s with common sense. Isn’t everything floating (…)?”

Just as Shia said, everything in their vicinity was floating.

The place that Hajime and his party had entered was a gigantic spherical room. The diameter itself was more than two kilometers. Inside the room, blocks with all kind of shapes and sizes were floating and ‘shii-,’ moved irregularly. It was a space that completely ignored gravity. However, for some reason Hajime and his party still felt gravity. Perhaps, only specific materials in this room were not restricted to gravity.

Inside this room, golem knights were able to fly around freely. Their falling directions were controlled after all, as they rapidly turned around. If they were living beings, it wouldn’t be weird for them to die due to the tremendous G-force. When he thought how their movements and tactics became better as they approached this space, perhaps…

“The one who controls the golems might be here, in this room, I think?”

Hearing Hajime’s guess, Yue and Shia also agreed and then stiffened their expressions. No one knew why, but the surrounding golem knights did not attack them. For now, because nothing happened, they observed their surroundings. They didn’t know if it was the last destination or if it continued after. However, this room was definitely close to the innermost room, proven by how the golem knights’ abilities were improved, and the uniqueness of this room.

Hajime used “Farsight” to investigate the gigantic, spherical space with his eyes. And, in the next moment, Shia’s unease filled voice rang out.

“Ruun!” “”!?””

Hajime and Yue, without asking what it was, instantly jumped when they heard Shia’s warning. Fortunately a block just passed by several meters ahead of them, allowing them to leave the block they were previously standing on.

Immediately,

ZUuGAGAGAN!!

A meteorite-like illusion came and it crashed into the block that Hajime and his party were on just a moment ago, blasting it into fine pieces. Meteorite wasn’t necessarily the wrong term for it. After all something gigantic made a scorching fall, and with its momentum it destroyed the block, and passed through.

Cold sweat flowed on Hajime’s cheeks. He would have received a direct hit from that without Shia’s warning. With him being unable to use “Vajra,” it would be an instant death. He was also unable to sense it coming. But immediately after Shia’s warning, he certainly felt the presence. However, with its falling speed it would be impossible to avoid it when he sensed it coming.

“Shia, you saved us. Thanks.” “… … nn, a big achievement.” “Ehehe, it was good that “Foresight” was activated. Although all of my magic was taken instead…”

Apparently, Shia’s special magic, “Foresight,” activated faster than Hajime’s perception was able to sense it. “Foresight” was able to see the future as a result of Shia’s assumed choice if she activated it manually, also, it could activate automatically. Just like this time, it saw through the big danger accompanied with death that affected her directly or indirectly.
