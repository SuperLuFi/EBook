[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [Aye, Aye, Sir!!!] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



[Very well! Get fired up! The new Hauria tribe, with 122 people…..]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ […….] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



[You will bring down the Imperial castle!]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [YAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



What do you plan on preparing, isn’t it impossible to bring down the Imperial castle, such thoughts and doubts flew away from the heads of the Hauria who were completely excited.



The person that calls himself boss is saying that he’ll give them the key that opens the door to them. Then, if they don’t wait and go on cutting their obstacles that lie ahead, it’ll be the shame of the new Hauria tribe. They won’t be able to show their face in public and even to Hajime who trained them. Therefore, the Hauria’s heart and minds become one, they were burning up with fighting spirit to bring down the Imperial castle.



In the rock zone away from the Imperial capital, the shouts of fighting spirit and murderous intent resounds.



[U~u, Shizu, Shizu, those people are scary~]



[You’ll be alright, Suzu. I’m scared too……I mean, in the first place Nagumo-kuns idea is already scary in itself]



[Nagumo-kun, that guy…….Hehe, who would have thought that he’d take on the role of HarOman-sensei, he’s not too bad]



[Ryutaro!? Why, do I sense a little intimacy!? No matter how you look at it, its an abnormal atmosphere!?]



Shizuku and them could only stare with a dumbfounded expression at the Hauria who were wrapped in a strange heat. A smile seems to have appeared on one person who was in awe and increased his respect towards Hajime.



[U~mu, this is awesome~. For the Usagininzoku to change this much. As expected of master. To make crushing the Empire the goal immediately. I can’t get enough of this~. I want to be abused with such spirit]



[…..Shut up, perverted dragon]



[~!? haha]



[Un, Teio-san read the mode a little? Rather than that, look at Shia’s expression, Yue. She melted]



[…….N, cute. So that Shia doesn’t cry…..it’s obvious I’m happy]



[That’s right~. It is good, I also want that kind of thing said to me~]



Yue, did she know this was going to happen from the beginning, the darkness in Shia’s eyes were wiped out and it gradually softened, though Kaori feels relieved when she sees so, she was also envious of Shia.



Afterwards, Hajime gave out the details of bringing down the Imperial castle, it was then decided that they would rest in preparation until that time.



Shia, for a while did not want to part from Hajime’s side. Her usual energetic self was rather silent, However, she wasn’t depressed, she snuggled up while blushing and held onto the hem of Hajime’s clothes quietly.



Her Usamimi’s occasionally when touching Hajime backed off and touch again. As it is, it’s nothing but showing feelings of wanting to be by Hajime’s side.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Dawn at night, shortly before the eastern sky begins to shine, there were two shadows sitting on the rock. It’s Hajime and Yue who woke up early. By the way, only Hajime is sitting on the rock, Yue is cradled on Hajime’s lap.



Everyone aside from the lookout post is asleep, the place they’re in is also a blind spot, the two people were enjoying their first quiet time together in a long time. And, at that time, Yue who had rested her head on Hajime’s shoulder looks up slowly at him, without a sign she kissed Hajime’s neck. A cute smooch sounded out, the silence of the morning was slightly shaken.



[……What’s wrong, suddenly?]



[N……somehow I just recalled something from last night]



The thing that happened last night that Yue was talking about, was about the talk of bringing down the Imperial castle. However, why that, the connection with the kiss couldn’t be understood, while returning a gentle look to Yue’s gentle gaze, Hajime looked puzzled.



[……Rather than the labyrinth, you gave priority to Shia who was “Important”. I’m happy that you’re treasuring Shia. I’m happy that the people who are “Important” for Hajime are increasing. So full of happiness that……I suddenly wanted to kiss]



When Yue said so, this time she kisses Hajime’s cheek.



[…..Will Shia become “Special” too?]



[…..That’s, Naa. This worlds number one, although number two would be a tough fight……the “Special” one is only Yue after all]



[…..Mu~u, it would be fine if it’s Shia……but, it’s troubling that I’m happy]



Yue’s expression was a complicated mix of happy feelings and troubled feelings.



Inside of Yue, it was her first friend that she made after getting out of the Abyss, it was her companion, and, Shia’s existence was that of a younger sister to her which seemed to also be an exception. Thats why, she wouldn’t allow the “special” seat to belong to any of the other women. Therefore, though she’s happy from the words of the single-minded Hajime, she becomes troubled by his obstinate outline.



To Yue’s appearance, Hajime gets offended a little. To be troubled for not allowing any other special women, somehow or another it offended him. So, for the time being, in order to not think about this situation anymore he decided to attack Yue’s lips with no questions asked.



[N~…..N~, Ah mu~u….Haji~…..N~]



The eastern skies finally start brightening more and more, it begins to create a shadow behind the two people. The perfectly overlapped shadow occasionally separate but quickly overlapped again, because of that, vivid sounds resounded each time.



Yue’s eyes moistened up in a fever, her cheeks were pink, and her lips shined glossily. Exactly as Hajime had intended. As it was, the movements of the two people as if natural, continued….they began to hear the voice of another person from the other side of the rock shade where Hajime had tried to do it.



[O~i, Nagumo. Are you there?]



Apparently it was Kouki, he came to look for Hajime who was not in his bed. Because his positivity has risen as well, everyone will likely wake up soon.



[Chi, it was just getting good, that bastard. Although I can stomach that he wants to learn some Age of Gods magic in the case of more like Nointo shows up……In various ways, this has become troublesome]



While cursing, there was no helping it, Hajime tried to stand up while holding Yue, but it didn’t happen.



Because,



[Hajime, I won’t let you escape. N]



[Hey, wa~]



It was because Yue pushed down Hajime. While riding Hajime’s waist then rising halfway up and positioning herself down to his waist again, Yue attacked Hajime this time.



[Kouki, was Nagumo-kun there?]



[Ahh, His presence can be felt somewhere around here!?]



Shizu and Suzu appeared behind Kouki, Ryutaro also showed up. Kouki took a detour around a rock while answering Shizuku, but he instinctively stiffens up when he witnessed the spectacle. While looking at the suspicious Kouki who stopped at the other side of the rock, Shizuku and them also peaked over the rock…..~Bishi~! they stiffened up.



In addition, from behind Shia, Kaori, and Teio are coming over. And, while dubiously seeing the stiff group, detoured around the rock……



[Hey~~~! Just what are you two doing so early in the morning!]



[…….Mu, Shia coming in too?]



[Eh? Is that alright? Then….]



[There’s no way that’ll be alright! Hurry up and separate! Attacking each other in the morning, how envi…..I mean, unreasonable!]



[Mu~u, am I no good? Just beating me a little would be fine though……]



While feeling the tiredness in the state of chaos manifested in the morning, this time around, Hajime lifts up Yue in one hand, and warded off Shia who was applying physical reinforcement onto her body to take up the previous offer, [Uu~, Uu~] Kaori groans out, Just like the pervert wanted, a strike hit her cheek [Ahan~] while controlling the condition he increased its force.



In a place a bit away, Kouki’s group who had stiffened up began to come to their senses. Suzu, [They’re adults, They’re adults~] although her face was still stiff her face became heated and dyed in red, Shizuku was carrying her by the side. However, that Shizuku’s ear’s were completely red.



The eastern sun that breaks out in the sky, though its also the signal which leads the Hauria to a battle for a new life…..it was a very stupid beginning for the start.





Chapter 116




The Imperial castle which symbolizes the Hoelscher empire, surrounded by a deep waterway that is about 20-meters in depth, also surrounded by strong castle walls where magic-like defenses were active. Guards are always stationed on the castle walls, even an aquatic demon would be shot in the waterways, as an entrance, there is only one front gate with a huge drawbridge.



The people who are able to come to the Imperial castle is also limited, only people who have permits imbued with magic are allowed to enter. In front of the drawbridge, there’s a huge post that resembles the triumphal arches in France, If you don’t clear the examination to enter the castle here, you wouldn’t be allowed to cross the drawbridge at all. If you try the impolite way and invade the castle, you’d be thrown into the waterways where demons thrive.



The inspection at the post is also quite merciless. For example, even if you were a trader of supplies going in and out with an entrance permit through regular procedures, every product would be inspected one by one. Therefore, it’s also impossible to try to invade by hiding in the luggage.



In other words, what I want to say is that, trying to trespass into the Imperial castle is extremely, extremely, difficult.



Towards that kind of fact, Kouki thought about it while waiting in line at the castle inspection ahead of the triumphal arch, he looked back and glanced over his shoulder. There, his usual party members and his childhood friends Shizuku, Ryutaro, Suzu, and also Hajime’s group were there.



Kouki’s group came back to the Imperial capital in order to enter the Imperial castle in a dignified manner.



Kouki’s thoughts. They were a diversion to allow Cam and them to escape the prison without additional commotions, and. Obviously, because Hajime had magic that allowed transfer through space he went with them on the rescue, although escaping wouldn’t be that difficult, if the security is already this severe just to enter, the guards inside of the Imperial capital is better left unsaid.



Lets say that you knew of the dungeons location through questioning beforehand, if the exact location is not understood, space magic transfer to a pinpoint location couldn’t be used. Thats why, after invading, its necessary to search on foot. Still, there’s no helping it that you would tip your hat to the person who accomplished such things without being caught. Kouki instinctively felt the “difference” between them again, [Ha~a], and leaked out a sigh.



By the way, an outside military unit was in charge of the distraction that kouki’s group caused, because it’s impossible for the military units in the Imperial castle to come out explicitly, it was hardly useful at all. Somewhat like, [What happened?], it was only on a slightly higher level than unrest.



[Next~…..you’re an unfamiliar face. ……Let me see your permit]



The guard soldiers looked at Kouki’s group with a suspicious expression.



The amount of people who can enter the Imperial castle is limited, so the guards know most of the faces. And, normally on their first visits people wear their best clothes, however they were extremely well equipped for a group that’s been invited to the Imperial castle for the first time. Thats why, like Kouki’s group, people dressed up like adventurers are rare. They were suspicious so they began to become more cautious.



[No, we don’t have any permits, in its place, we have this…..]



[Ha? A status plate? Just what……]



Naturally, Hajime and them did not have a permit to enter the Imperial castle. But, Kouki’s position is useful here. After all, he is the “Hero”. The trump card of the human race whom God sent into the game with the Majinzoku race and was viewed publicly as “God’s Apostle”. For example, even if that wasn’t the actual reality of the situation.



Although the guard gave them dangerous looks when they said they didn’t have permits, his eyes twinkled when he read the characters “Hero” displayed on the status plate, he alternately looks back and forth between the status plate and kouki’s face. From the guards reaction, the surrounding colleagues were beginning to pay attention.



[Ehtto……Hero……sama, right? God’s apostle that was summoned in the Kingdom?]



[Ah, yes, that’s right. I’m the hero. Though I came with princess Ririana who is here……due to a few circumstances]



[Ha, Ha~a…..]



From the guard’s mutter, his colleagues learned of Kouki’s identity and began to become increasingly noisy. Their expressions were natural, [Why, did you come separately from princess Ririana?] [Why, didn’t you communicate this beforehand?], their questions were full of doubt.



However, the other party is God’s apostle whom they believe in, surely they were in charge of a secret mission that was given to them, for the time being, they passed the word to the higher-ups.



As expected, even for the hero, because they didn’t have the courage to let a person who wasn’t scheduled to enter the castle with their own discretion, several guards disappeared while dashing into the Imperial castle as they were frightened to rudely keep them waiting.



Hajime and them are placed in the waiting room of the post.



After waiting 15 minutes.



Disregarding “Yue who was on Hajime’s Knee” which became a scene so natural that nobody bothers to tsukkomi anymore, Shia was sitting on the other Knee, Kaori and Teio formed a partnership at the last second and held on to his hands respectively, then they began to hear the ~Dota Dota~ footsteps coming from the drawbridge.



[I heard that the Hero’s group had come here….Is it you guys?]



[Ah, yes, that’s right. That’s us]



While saying so and showing his appearance, it was an especially large empire soldier, it’s possible to tell that he’s of a higher rank from the attitudes of the surrounding soldiers. He, while impudently staring at Kouki, and checking Kouki’s status plate, he began to glance at the other members in investigation.



In the process, when Shia who was in the blind spot was seen, his eyes opened widely in surprise. And he began grinning an unpleasant smile of interest. Towards the unpleasant glance, Shia’s body shakes slightly.



[I’ve confirmed it. I am the commander of the third regiment, Grid Half. Word of the hero’s group has already entered princess Ririana’s ears as well, she’s waiting in her room. I’ll have my subordinate guide you. ……By the way, hero, the Usagininzoku? She doesn’t have a slave collar on her right?]



[Eh? No, she’s…..]



The man who introduced himself as Grid Half asked about Shia as he returned the status plate.



However, Kouki was troubled on how to answer. She wasn’t a slave, the choker that Shia wore looked nothing like a slave’s collar, he hesitated if he should declare that she was Hajime’s lover or not. [Even if you ask me such things……] he honestly replied.



Did Kouki’s answer allow him to judge to not expect anything which cause him to become quiet, Grid glanced over towards Shia. And, they managed to guess the reason why he is so intensely paying attention to Shia.



[Yo~o, Usagi lass. I’ve got a few questions for you. ……What happened to my subordinates?]



[Subordinates? …..Um….what do you…..]



From Grid’s sudden question.



For an instant, although Shia had no idea what he was talking about, she seemed to have guessed and her eyes were opened wide in astonishment.



The empire soldiers who had a direct relation to Shia were limited. It was naturally, the group of people that cornered the Hauria tribe when leaving the Sea of Trees. Many family members were killed, abducted, placed into slavery, and it was the enemies that drove Shia to go to the [Raisen Great Canyon].



[It’s odd huh? Even though she’s returned, none of my subordinates came back, why are you still alive and in such a place? A~a?]



[Ua~…..]



Grid gradually approached to corner Shia.



Right, he was the commander of the forces that attacked Shia’s group that came out of the Sea of Tree’s before. Because Grid who was the regiment commander didn’t personally come to capture Shia, she had no memories of ever seeing Grid before, however Grid firmly recalled that there was a rare Usagininzoku with blue-white hair.



In Shia’s mind, the expressions of the empire soldiers had when attacking to tease them and the sense of hopelessness of losing a family member at that time, flashed back. While unconsciously raising out a groan and her expression stiffening up, one step, trying to back away…..she felt a warm touch on her cheeks and became startled.



If you look, just as usual, Hajime picked up shia’s cheeks. And, immediately after that, she felt warmth in her hand. That was Yue.



Her eyes looking up showed no worries, if anything it was amazement, a slight color of scolding appeared though. It seemed to imply, [Don’t be overwhelmed by small fries of this level, Greenhorn].



Shia who was looking at Yue and Hajime, with a wry smile said, [I’m alright now]. No matter how you looked at it, the events which took placed was a trauma, the present Shia was unmistakably a strong person who had enough power and spirit to crush the monsters in the great labyrinths to pieces. There’s no reason for her to be overwhelmed by the pressure that one officer was releasing.



Shia with an attractive smile after decisively straightening her spine towards the approaching Grid. And declared to Grid who instinctively stopped advancing.



[I don’t know a thing about your subordinates. They were likely people who were slow in the head, maybe they were eaten by some kind of demon that appeared somewhere? Also, there’s no reason for me to answer your questions at all]



[…..You sure are getting full of yourself. A~a? Did you think you were safe because you’re with the Hero’s group? If you’re not a slave, then you probably solded away that body of yours? A prostitute’s life, I won’t be taking such tongue from you]



Although Grid said those dangerous words while dangerously steeling up his eyes, Shia had already removed eye contact with Grid, her eyes told that she didn’t care. Rather, having called Shia a prostitute, the other women looked at Grid with anger.



While looking at Shia’s attitude, his veins appeared and his expression twisted with anger, when he noticed the looks, to deceive them he smiled and declared to Kouki.



[I’m terribly sorry, Hero-dono. This Usagininzoku seems to know something something about my subordinates that have been missing since 2 months ago, Will you listen to my request? If you need an Usagininzoku woman, I can prepare another for you, this time around…..]



[Oi, underling]



However, a voice interrupted before Grid finished talking. At the same time that Grid glanced towards the voice, his expression cramped up because of anger, there the annoyed looking Hajime was seen.



[What……]



[Don’t open your mouth, underling. Your role is already over. Making us stay forever over foolish things. Quit wasting time and guide us quickly]



[Why you little……]



[Can you not understand the meaning of being silent? To us, we don’t even have a miniscule amount of time to spend on you. Know your place]



To Hajime’s words, Grid’s face is dyed completely red because of the hooligan who picked a fight since they didn’t want anything to do with him. His eyes became bloodshot in anger. Even then, self-control was something a regiment commander was required to have, with just one wrong line to “God’s Apostles” he would definitely be cut from his position, he became silent and the subordinate in the back began to guide them.



Disregarding Grid who was staring at Hajime with bloodshot eyes, Hajime’s group left the room as if nothing happened.



Although Kouki’s group had slightly cramped cheeks because of Hajime’s objection, the females looked refreshed. As for Hajime, there was no intent on being sarcastic……If he knew of that, blood might have gushed out from Grid’s blood vessels.



However, it seemed that a “crotch smash” was about to happen if he still didn’t understand because he had called Shia a prostitute……Grid should be happy for himself to have such self discipline.



Hajime’s group didn’t worry about the piercing gaze that came from behind them, the huge suspension bridge was extended and they followed the pale expressioned guide.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



[And?]



That was the first word that Ririana said to Hajime’s group as they were guided into the room in the Imperial castle. Although she wore a smile on her face, her eyes were cold and didn’t smile at all. It seemed to express, [Explain the circumstances right away damn it!].



Most likely she was busy to death from the Empires conferences. Inside of her, no matter how she looked at it Hajime’s group appearing was troublesome, unexpectedly, there was no helping that she said such things. In a sense, it was a sign of familiarity……though it might not be as well.



[Besides the farce at the Imperial capital, why on earth is everybody here? I demand a clear explanation. Yes, I strongly, strongly, demand for one. I won’t forgive you if you trick me! Especially, Nagumo-san! It was definitely you who pulled the strings from behind the scenes! Don’t treat others as if they were someone elses problems and stop feeling Shia-san’s fluffy usamimi’s! Yue-san’s also caressing and touching Shia-san’s cheeks as well!]



Ririana’s lost it! She glares at Hajime with enough power that it seems to create sounds.



It’s exactly as she said, Ririana thought it was Hajime’s idea in the Imperial capital, and it was also his idea to come to the Imperial castle. Putting it simply, Hajime has been recognized as the leader of the group, the schemes which would normally be considered insane could only be formed from Hajime’s mind.



And, Hajime who was being blamed, was unusually gently feeling Shia’s usamimi’s while she sat on his knee. On the other knee, Yue had both hands from the front and was caressing and touching Shia’s cheeks.



[Your voice is too loud, princess. What’s the problem? Today, Shia’s kinda unstable]



[Unstable…..you say? is she not feeling well somewhere?]



At once Ririana became worried immediately, shes a good person as well.



Shia that receives the glance, though biting her lip to endure something, her expression began to loosen from her ears being felt and her cheeks being caressed, when she raised her face she showed a smile and said, [I’m fine].



The reason which caused Shia’s emotions to become unstable was obviously because of Grid.



However, it was not unstability from fear in particular. It was the opposite. She was restraining her overflowing murderous intent. No matter how you say it, Grid’s group was the hateful party that took away a lot of Shia’s family. As long as she gets over her trauma, only strong murderous intent flows afterwards.



However, after thinking about their purpose for coming here, she wasn’t able to immediately kill him. That’s why, she desperately endured it. And, Hajime and Yue who understood this, tried to sooth Shia by indulging her.



For people who don’t know of the circumstances, when summed up, the relation of Grid and Shia were spoken, everyones expression became sorrowful, afterwards, Kouki’s group naturally resented them for that, and Ririana looked down with a dark expression. For Ririana, the enslavement of Demi-humans were commonsense in the world and allowed, she didn’t think it was far too unreasonable although she did feel resentment.



She who judged herself decided that she wasn’t qualified to say anything, towards the members that were making angry faces, [It’s fine~, really], Shia said with a dazzling smile, they urged the continuation of the story from Hajime.



[And, why did you guys come here? What about your business at the forest? And also, what was up with the masked disturbance last night? It should almost be time for his Majesty, Gaharudo, to call us for a meeting. I want to get our stories straight ahead of time before we meet, so I’d like you to tell me the bare minimum if you would]



[Ma~a, don’t be so restless, princess. When night comes, you’ll understand everything. We…..want to hurry and wrap things up after all, we stopped for a slight detour…..that should be all that you need to know for now]



[S, such unreasonableness…..I’ll know when its night you say, it can’t be, do you plan to create another disturbance with masks again? I understand now! Nagumo-san was the one that made Shizuku and them dress in those embarrassing getups!]



[Don’t get so excited. You’ll grow bald, princess]



[I won’t grow bald! Just what are you saying to a lady!]



[……Stress baldness]



[Yue-san!?]



She seemed to realise that Hajime didn’t plan on speaking any further, moreover, Ririana who received such impolite treatment, [Even though I’m a princess…..], while being depressed. Right next to her, Shizuku was, [embarrassing getups…..], muttering quietly while being reminded of her dark history.



Afterwards, in the place where Ririana became depressed she explained the situation, apparently his Majesty, Gaharudo, was told of the story about the end of the church and gods who went mad.



However, as expected of their abilities reign supreme principles, the top of the country is in utilitarianism*basically everyone in the country believes in the system*. Though there seems to have been moderate impact, while fearlessly laughing he declared that the way they did things wouldn’t particularly change anyways. In other words, if it’s an enemy, they’ll be cut down, if you want something, then forcefully take it, the weak must obey the strong! is what he said.



Further more Gaharudo wondered how Ririana traveled to the Empire, he was anxious.



In other words, though he understood the story of the Kingdom being attacked, the amount of time that it took Ririana to reach the empire was far too quick. Though he was saved because the Empire also felt that an immediate conference of cooperation with the Kingdom should be held, it was impossible to arrive at the Empire after only 1 week of the attack.



At the same time, how did the Kingdom manage to drive away the Majinzoku’s army, he was considerably interested in their methods.



About the “Pillar of Light” that gave the demonic army forces a fatal blow, rather than talks about the God’s, excuses of “Heaven’s Judgement” wouldn’t cut it for Gaharudo. When it comes to that, naturally, he came to the assumption that someone had a weapon capable of destroying an entire army in one blow. To that truth, as the Emperor of the Hoelscher Empire, and as a person, he wasn’t able to overlook it.



If he investigates it, he’ll know immediately, Ririana who got permision from Hajime beforehand, especially talked about how troublesome Hajime was.



However, because she thought Hajime was wasn’t at the Empire but traveling around in a faraway place, he had actually entered the heart of the Empire and was meddling in Gaharudo’s greedy ambitions, then, on the other hand, what kind of movements will Hajime be taking from now on, Ririana was extremely anxious.



……Mainly, in the sense that the Empire gets mysteriously wiped out from the maps.



Therefore, in the place where she would previously wait to meet with Gaharudo, although she couldn’t meet with him because of previous events…..Hajime is being evasive and unserious, Ririana was already, [If you’re going to do it~ do it seriously~], while her state of mind was slightly neglectful. Surely, being uneasy about her own misgivings, she would never have guessed in her wildest dreams.



From Ririana, to some extent, heard the rooms door being knocked on and the contents of the conference with the empire was heard. It seems that time’s run out. While following the guide, Hajime and them are heading for the reception room where Gaharudo is waiting.





Chapter 117




When we entered into the room, it was a fairly plain room with little decoration and there was a table large enough to hold about 30 people. On the upper seat of the table sat a man, the Emperor of the Hoelscher Empire, Gaharudo D. Hoelscher, who had a fearless smile while resting his chin on his hand. There are 2 people behind him, they had a keen air about them in the sense of “We’re capable” as they stood waiting.



And, although we couldn’t see their figures in the room, there was also 2 more people on the other side of the wall, 4 people in the ceiling, and Hajime also felt 2 people soundlessly outside the closed door they came though. It wasn’t only the 2 behind Gaharudo, the other hidden men seemed to have been considerably skilled as well.



[So, are you Hajime Nagumo?]



When Hajime’s group entered, Ririana also introduced them, while completely skipping the greetings to Kouki who was the hero, Gaharudo released pressure while looking at Hajime with a piercing gaze.



It was pressure from the overpowering man who ruled over several hundred thousands of people who were wild and strong and believed in the nature of power. It was no joke. Ririana who was also in a royal family voiced a small groan from the stifling pressure, Kouki’s group backed away instinctively.



However, from such overpowering pressure, these 5 people, Hajime, Yue, Shia, Teio, and Kaori, were calm. In the first place, even Kaori who had little experience survived from the attack of an immortal monster thats been alive since the ancient times at the [Merujine Undersea Ruins].



So although the Emperor had an overpowering pressure, when compared to the monsters in the great labyrinths, it was nothing more than a soft breeze.



Gaharudo’s mouth lifts up more and more in interest when he sees that Hajime’s group is unphased, then Hajime answered.



[Yes, I’m Hajime Nagumo. Its an honor to have been known by you, your Majesty the Emperor]



[ [ [ [ [!?] ] ] ] ]



While placing his hand on his chest and lightly bowing, Kouki’s group looked at Hajime with astonishment at his words.



Their eyes opened wide and clearly conveyed, [Who are you!]. Especially Ririana who was shaking in unease. While receiving Gaharudo’s overpowering pressure and raising a small groan, though her expression hardly changed, it wasn’t able to conceal that she was staring at Hajime with an aghast expression.



Hajime also knows of the TPO*Time, Place, Occasion*. However, he was always just ignoring it.



But, because he had business in the Imperial castle this time, he didn’t want to be thrown out because he disrespected the Emperor. Since he shouldn’t believe in God anymore, the title of “God’s Apostle” is probably not effective anymore. The only way to pass is with the title of Hero. Thats why, he judged that he needed to at least use the bare minimum amount of etiquette. Although the changed person was definitely still Hajime.



[Kukuku…..I never even considered this. What happened to your usual arrogant attitude? N? It’s quite different from the cries of a certain princess somewhere?]



However, Gaharudo only makes fun of him while laughing.



Hajime glanced over at Ririana. [Princess~, You, just how much did you unnecessarily talk about, A~a?] Ririana who was receiving Hajime’s glance, ~Pui~! looked in another direction. When Gaharudo asked what kind of person Hajime was, she unintentionally yelled and complained a great deal about her treatment.



[…….Ha~a, that’s right. hm then, as usual]



[Kuku, then it’s fine]



Though they were surprised of Hajime’s sudden change, they sat down in order.



Finally after Gaharudo removed his gaze off Hajime, he noticed Yue and them who took up their positions by Hajime and observed them interestingly, his eyes seemed to significantly glance at Shia in particular. Following that, he turned his gaze towards Kouki’s group…..he looked at Shizuku who was next to Kouki and a grin appeared on both his lips and eyes.



[Shizuku, it’s been a while. Have you finally decided to become my wife?]



[O, oi! Shizuku already declined before!]



Kouki reacted to Gaharudo before Shizuku did. Gaharudo’s glances over at Kouki for an instant, then back at Shizuku and started laughing hysterically. Kouki had the “I don’t care” attitude but veins were appearing on his forehead.



While sighing at the 2 people, Shizuku had a clarified face and answered.



[I have no intentions to take back my previous words. I’ll have to decline your Majesties offer]



[Quite heartless. But, it wouldn’t be interesting otherwise. More than the world, allow me to tell you it’s good. I await the day when that clarified face is dyed in red from longing for me]



[That day will never come throughout all of eternity. …..Or rather, don’t you already have an Empress?]



[What about it? Are you dissatisfied as a concubine? Fumu, there are a variety of problems when you become the legal wife……]



[I didn’t mean it that way! You’d place your hands on other woman other than the Empress…..]



[What are you saying? I’m the Emperor? 10 or 20 concubines are normal]



[Gu~……that’s right. A, anyways, I will not become his Majesties. Please give up]



[Ma~a, since you won’t be returned by God anymore, you’ll probably be stuck in this world for a while, I suppose I should take my time to convince you. Kuku, prepare yourself, Shizuku]



It appears that Gaharudo really likes Shizuku. As expected of a greedy Emperor, he won’t give up even when he’s been refused. His sharp eyes were completely locked onto Shizuku. Though Shizuku looks away with an expression that seemed to hate him from the bottom of her heart, she also seemed to not care at all.



Then, at that time, the direction that Shizuku looked in, by chance, aligned with Hajime’s sight. From Hajime’s glance at that time, [As expected of the worldly-wise man (laughs)] a color of amusement and interest was clearly included.



The angered Shizuku just used her finger to play with the sugar cubes that were prepared for her tea. Although it wasn’t as strong as Hajime’s, the sugar cube flew with excellent power, it’s aim was accurately flying towards Hajime’s hateful face……



However, it wasn’t a direct hit, it flew into Hajime’s mouth and was caught. ~Mogo Mogo~ Hajime’s mouth moved around with an air of flamboyant pride, after the sweetness of the sugar cube was firmly satisfied, he swallowed it. Shizuku’s face was mortifying, however Hajime’s was clarified.



When Gaharudo saw her in such a state, he turned his sharp glance back at Hajime. It seemed to convey a variety of things.



[Fu~n, this is quite the interesting situation. ……Hajime Nagumo. Though I have a mountain of questions that I want to ask you, first of all, answer this]



[Ah? what is it…….]



[You, have you already embraced*sex being implied* my Shizuku?]



[ [ [ [Bufu~u–!?] ] ] ]



To Gaharudo who abruptly asked such an unexpected question with an eager expression, several people including Shizuku blew out air.



Even the guards that were waiting behind Gaharudo, [Your Majesty……the first thing you wanted to ask, was that……] with a pained expression. They also seemed to be worldly-wise men.



[Wai-, your Majesty! Just what are you suddenly saying….]



[Shizuku, you remain silent for now. I’ll hear it from Hajime Nagumo right now]



Naturally, although Shizuku tried to burst Gaharudo’s bubble with a tsukkomi, Gaharudo turned his eyes to Hajime, ignoring it. On the other hand, Hajime had an amazed expression.



[What did you think about to reach that conclusion]



[It appears that Shizuku has the heart to forgive you……Judging from that manner, it’s not impossible, so just in case]



[Ha~a, there’s no way that would happen]



[……Fumu, that’s not a lie right. Then, what do you think of Shizuku?]



To that question, all the glances in the room turned to Hajime. Eyes conveying various meanings from Yue’s group and Kouki’s group pierced him.



Hajime let out a sigh about why the first question asked by the Emperor after meeting him was about his relationship with Shizuku, anyways he turned his gaze over to Shizuku. Shizuku’s expression was supposed to be extremely amusing. Hajime looked at Shizuku who was inclining her neck.



It appears that Shizuku’s ears began to slightly redden…..



For the time being, the answer (real intentions) was given.



[……She’s like a mother]



[OK, that fight you’re looking for, you’ve won it. Get off the table, Nagumo-kun]



a young 17-year old girl was being held down, of all the things to say, why was it “She’s like a mother”, is what Shizuku who was still sitting on her seat and was getting up was conveying with hatred in her glare at Hajime. The delicate atmosphere from a while ago had already disappeared. Suzu and Kouki who were next to Shizuku were panicking and desperately tried to hold her down.



[……I didn’t think it would be such a boring answer……ma~a, fine. Shizuku, don’t go accidently falling in love now? Because you’re mine]



[I’ve already said this but, I have no intentions of being his Majesties and I’ve also not fallen for Nagumo-kun! Just stop with the nonsense and get back to the main subject]



[I get it, I get it. Don’t get so angry. An excessive denial will only be taken as a positive one?]



[Nuguu~u……]



Shizuku instinctively tried to raise a groan in objection to Gaharudo but decided to sit down loudly. Suzu calmed her with a wry smile, however for some reason Kouki was glaring at Hajime.



[Hajime Nagumo. You as well, don’t go placing your hands on Shizuku?]



[Be relieved, I don’t have the faintest interest in doing that. Rather, if you’re only going to idly chat, I’d like to leave now?]



[Our chit chat was unneeded huh. It’s a talk about a new concubine……or Empress that may appear you know? It even involves the Empire’s future…..ma~a, what I wanted to talk about certainly wasn’t about Shizuku. You should already know right? It’s about your abnormality]



Gaharudo bought time by starting with Shizuku to observe Hajime, he judged it was the proper time and slowly the entire atmosphere changed. It was different from the playful atmosphere, it was now one filled with ambition, it gave off a radiance of a sharp blade.



Gaharudo cut to the chase and asked the biggest reason for meeting with Hajime’s group.



[I’ve heard about it to some degree from princess Ririana. You’re someone who’s made it to the end of the great labyrinths and obtained the ability to create artifacts……completely repelled the Majinzoku’s army, and was able to travel the distance which would normally take 2 months in less than 2 days, such an artifact. Is it true?]



[Ahh]



[And you have no intentions of sharing those artifacts with neither the Kingdom nor Empire?]



[Ahh]



[Fu~n, one person monopolizing that power…….do you think we’d allow such a thing?]



[Whose permission is required? If I’m not allowed, what exactly are you going to do about it?]



Gaharudo steeled his eyes to Hajime’s response.



The Emperor’s ambitions increased even more, Ririana began gritting her teeth and was worrying nonstop. The bodyguards behind Gaharudo began to release bloodlust before Gaharudo did. In contrast, the presence of the people who were hiding in the room began to diminish even further. It was exactly like a touch-and-go state.



Towards the tensed air Kouki’s group had stiff faces and steeled themselves for battle.



However, Hajime’s group completely warded off the breeze-like bloodlust with their own heavy bloodlust which could be felt sticking onto their skins, then calmly reached out for the tea cups. At that instant, he glanced at the locations of where the hiding people’s hidden presences were. [Have we been noticed?] they said.



did they notice properly, their presence that could be felt shook slightly.



[Hahaha, stop, stop it. We were completely seen though. This guys a genuine flesh and blood monster. If we fought now, we’d be completely annihilated!]



Gaharudo was laughing hysterically and hid his ambitions. The surrounding people who had dangerous airs also matched it accordingly.



[Why do you look like you’re enjoying this so much?]



[Oi, oi, I’m the head of the “Empire” you know? When you meet a strong guy, it’ll be a lie to say that your heart doesn’t dance around right?]



Kouki’s group, although they couldn’t understand what was going on, they let out relieved breaths because the atmosphere was less tense, Hajime also tsukkomied the unusually happy Gaharudo. Gaharudo’s answer was definitely one of those who believe in the abilities reign supreme policy.



[Even so, those women you’ve got there are quite outrageous. Oi, where did you find them? For there to be women of this caliber, I want to ask you a request directly…..allow me to have one of them, Hajime Nagumo]



[Don’t say such foolish things. You’re in over your head…..no, it might be fine if it’s Teio]



[~!? Wh, what did you……say, master casually wants to sell mistress to another man! Haa~ Haa~, being treated so…..I can’t get enough of it. Haa~ Haa~]



[There’s a slight problem, though she’s a great woman appearance-wise]



[Sorry, even the Emperor has his limits. As expected, a girl dripping with pervertedness is too much]



[Th, this guy, to say it right in front of the person being talked about! Kuu~uu, N~, N~, surely, after this I’ll be forcefully taken by his Majesty, messing up mistress right before master’s eyes….Haa~ Haa~…..N~~……..I need to change my underwear]



Even Gaharudo and them could only stare dumbfounded at Teio’s strangely refreshing expression. Then they turned their gaze to Hajime who traveled with such a perverted woman. Gaharudo changed the mood by clearing his throat.



[As for me, I’m quite more interested in that Usagininzoku there? I’ve never seen an Usagininzoku with that kind of hair before and she completely disregarded my bloodlust as well. That mental attitude reminds me of the toy’s that I caught a while ago, how about that one?]



Towards Gaharudo’s word “Toy’s”, Shia’s eye twitched for an instant in reaction. Yue who was next to her, clasped her hand quietly underneath the table.



[Even if you tell me about your toys…..]



[You can’t think of anything, you mean? Do you want to go check them out later? Actually, I still have more(. .)animals, although they’re a woman and a child, they’re quite——]



[I’m not interested]



Gaharudo’s words were a bluff. Through Cam, it’s been confirmed that all the people caught were already rescued. He’s probably trying to ask baiting questions. Compared to that, Hajime’s answer was only a line.



However, Gaharudo’s attack wasn’t over yet.



[Ho~o, those fellows had special short swords and equipment on the 5-star level, even then you’re not interested, Synergist(. . .)?]



[None]



[…..I see. By the way, yesterday, there were some people who managed to break out of the prison in the dungeon, the Imperial castle was easily invaded and they escaped, that kind of thing could only be done with a special artifact’s(. .)magic, do you know anything about it?]



[I don’t know]



[……Ha~a……then it’s fine. This is the last question I want to know of…….what do you think of God?]



[I’m not interested]



[Ah~, I get it already. Jeez, you’re such an unsocial brat]



Gaharudo was cursing as he scratched his head ~Gari Gari~. However, he still had a somewhat happy expression. He seems to favor the other party who he argued with. From what he soaked in from the exchange, Gaharudo probably guessed Hajime’s was connected with the Hauria tribe, he noticed that the prisonbreak was through Hajime’s guidance.



And he seemed to understand Hajime’s stance on this world’s problems from his short answers. At least, it seems like they won’t be facing off against Hajime. After all, not being chased out of the Imperial castle is already great evidence.



Then the time came, one of the men waiting in the back quietly whispered into Gaharudo’s ear, Gaharudo slowly left his seat.



[Ma~a, I heard the minimum amount that I wanted to hear……rather, I already understood, so all is well. Ah, that’s right. Tonight, we’ll be holding princess Ririana’s welcome party. By all means, please attend. It’ll also serve as my son and the princess’s engagement party. Even though the truth is different, if you didn’t know of it, the blessings as a “Hero” or “God’s Apostle” would be good. I’m begging you here? Hero’s only of form?]



Gaharudo ignored Kouki and their dumbfounded looks when they heard the explosive remarks suddenly dropped into their ears, and provocatively stared at Hajime with a fearless smile, he then gallantly left the room.



The door sounded out in a slam, As a result, Kouki and them regained their composure and quickly questioned Ririana.



[Ririi, what’s this about an engagement! Just what exactly happened!]



[That’s….for example, besides the mad Gods, if the Majinzoku attacks us then there’s no choice but to retaliate. The king of our country has died, the successor is still only 10 years old, it’s not enough to steer the country, then, it’s necessary to strengthen our relationships with an ally]



[That’s why Ririi is getting engaged with the prince?]



[Yes. My partner is the crowned prince. There have always been many discussions about engaging us beforehand. He was practically already my fiance, It’s just that it’ll be finalized at this party. Exactly because we’re shaken up by the devils invasion, is what I mean]



[What about the Kingdom? You don’t have to consult this with them?]



[There’s already been a majority that consented to it before, so there shouldn’t be any objections. To begin with, it was that kind of story. Besides, right now the most substantial person in the Kingdom is me. Randell is only in form, because mother isn’t a person to step up into the front. Therefore, there are no problems. Right now, quick decisions are necessary]



Ririana said with a resolute expression. Kouki’s group had their jaws opened, then they closed it with a sour look on their faces.



[……Does Ririi like that person?]



[It’s not about liking or disliking. This is to build a connection between countries. It’s just that, the crown prince already has many mistresses, the amount of people would cause you to become offended and hurt your stomach*I think?*. My position aside, we cannot balance out if I’m married to the other princes, there’s no helping it……]



[Wh, why, how can you be fine with it! Even though you don’t like him, to be marrying that kind of man is strange!]



[If you look at it, that may be what it looks like, because I’m a princess from the royal family. Since birth, this was natural]



[Natural you say……even Ririi is a girl. Don’t you want to marry someone that you actually like?]



Kouki couldn’t understand and yelled, Ririana could only reply back with a troubled smile.



Ririana was certainly a girl. She became especially close friends with the women that came from another world, If it’s about Koari and Shizuku’s girls talk then, naturally she yearns for a romantic love.



To Ririana who was wryly smiling, Shizuku stopped Kouki who’s arguing became increasingly wild. Inside where the delicate atmosphere flowed, Hajime slowly left his seat. And tried to leave the room as if nothing happened. To that, Kouki let out his feelings that had nowhere else to go.



[Oi! Nagumo! Do you think nothing of this!]



[Ha~a? What do you think I can do about the princess’s engagement? More so, this is a form of politics taking shape as a marriage? Rather, this isn’t something an amateur can even intervene in]



[Gu~, bu, but….]



[More importantly, there are things that we have to do. If you do something rash and end up obstructing us, I’ll knock you down flat alright?]



After Hajime said that, Yue and them also quickly left. While calming down the riled up Kouki, depending on the results of what’ll happen in the near future, the engagement talk may be scrapped, Shizuku looked up towards the ceiling with some tiredness.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Hajime and them who exited, after Shizuku’s group talked with each other for 2 or 3 stories, they returned to their rooms arranged for them by the attendant maids because Ririana had to prepare for the party at night. For such an occasion, it’s mainly dresses.



[Ma~a, it’s wonderful, Ririana-sama!]



[Really……you look exactly like a flower fairy]



[Surely, his royal highness would be pleased a well!]



One of the dress candidates was chosen in the end after trying on dozens of others, to Ririana who turned around in front of the full-length mirror, the entranced blushing maids surrounding her let out compliments. Although shew as only 14-years-old she had an exquisite charm as a woman, combined with the light pink dress only amplified it’s effects to the maximum. Just like one of the maids had said, she had the loveliness of a flower spirit.



[That’s, right. Shall we go with this. Next is the accessories…..]



Ririana herself seemed to consent with a nod.



No matter how much this was a political marriage, the crown prince was an extreme ladies man who resembled his father, Bias D. Hoelscher, when they met several times in the past, he looked at Ririana with indecent eyes when she still hadn’t even reached the age of 10, that scums actual ability wasn’t half-baked, he called a lower class knight for “practice” while at the Kingdom to show off his strength as he teased the knight, however the fact that he will become her husband won’t change.



As so, Ririana couldn’t bring shame to her partner, since it’s their engagement party, Ririana intended to dress up to her maximum potential. Shaking away the word “liked person” that Kouki said from her head.



Ririana was also a woman. She was also popular with many other talented women of the Hairihi Kingdom, so she had yearnings to be a normal girl as well. When she’s in a pinch, the prince who she dreamed of would appear, then they’d be attracted to each other from their chanced meeting, she’s even dreamt up stories of overcoming multiple obstacles in their reach for love together.



But, it’s an impossible future. Because Ririana was intelligent, she accepted that she would be called for on a mission since she was young. That’s why, even if she feels repulsed by the other partner from the bottom of her heart, her feelings of wanting to be an excellent wife is true, she was determined to magnificently serve the crowned prince after the party.



Then, at that time, suddenly, the outside of her room became noisy. Ririana’s door was flung open without knocking, and a large man without hesitation, rudely entered the room. Though he stopped as the knights of the Imperial guards*the Kingdoms* ran up to Ririana’s side, the man didn’t particularly care.



[Ho~o, is that the dress for tonight……it’s about average I guess]



[…..Bias-sama. Suddenly breaking into a lady’s room isn’t an admirable act]



[A~a? I’m going to be your husband? why are you talking back at me?]



[…….]



The person warning Ririana with a gloomy expression is, Bias D. Hoelscher, whom she is to be engaged to. The same as several years ago, he carried a rude tyrannical atmosphere, he continued to look at Ririana from top to bottom indecently. A chill ran through Ririana’s spine.



[Oi, everyone leave at once]



Bias with a grin on his lips, suddenly ordered all the maids and knights of the Imperial guard to leave. He ordered again threatenly for those that were puzzled, the maids left the room panickingly. However, the Imperial guards, naturally hesitated. Ririana notices that Bias’s eyes were becoming dangerous, unsure of what to do she ordered the guards to stand down.



[Fu~n, when disciplining your dogs, make sure to do it firmly]



[……They are not dogs. They’re my important vassals]



[……Rebellious as ever I see? Kuku, still the same brat that hasn’t even reached 10 years old, it was worthwhile being glared at with that hateful gaze of yours. At that time, I already decided that you were going to be mine someday]



When he said that, Bias had a disgusting smile on his face while watching Ririana who had stiffened up from the bottom of her heart, suddenly her breasts were grabbed at.



[~!? No~! Ouch!]



[Even still, you’ve grown up. It’s still not enough though, however that in itself is appetizing]



[St, stop]



Towards the violent action, Ririana’s expression distorted into pain. When Bias saw the expression, his laughter became much more excited, he then pushed down Ririana onto the ground. Although Ririana was screaming, the Imperial guards outside didn’t seem to notice.



[You can cry as much as you want? Because this room has a special mechanism in place, sound cannot reach the outside. Ma~a, even if those dogs entered, they can’t do anything against me because I’m the crowned prince. After all, do you want those fellows to see your virginity being taken away? Ku, Hahahaha~]



[Why……this kind of…….]



Ririana became pale when she thought of the things that will be done in the future, she courageously glared at Bias.



[It’s those eyes. Those rebellious eyes, painfully, despairing, I want to turn those into eyes of pleasure. Above all else, I love teasing defiant people into submission. People who are struggling desperately, there’s no higher pleasure than to have them kneel down and lower their heads. If you taste this pleasure even once, you can’t live without it. Ririana. When I first met you who was courageously judging me with your eyes, I thought that I’d want to mess you up at some point]



[People like you……]



[Na~a, Ririana. Rather than after marriage, if you lose your virginity before the engagement party, what kind of face will you have at the party? While enduring the pain from your groin, what kind of expression will you have in front of the people? A~a, I just can’t wait to see it]



For example, even if she feels disgust towards the other party, if she properly supports him as a supportive wife, surely, eventually he will become a splendid emperor, No, the heart that Ririana steeled up had already started cracking.



Ririana realised. In front of her was a grinning man who wanted to see the enduring Ririana’s tears fall out desperately, in another sense, he was definitely the “Crowned Prince of the Empire”.



The dress that she chose in order to not shame Bias, was torn by his hands. The skin of a stainless gem was exposed, Ririana’s face blushed in shame. Both of her hands were suppressed above her head, she wasn’t able to conceal herself with her legs.



Bias while smirking, possibly attempting to kiss her, his face was slowly coming closer to Ririana. Almost like, Ririana’s eyes remained opened wide full of fear. Ririana couldn’t turn her face away because her chin was held in place, unknown to herself, tears began to flow from her eyes due to the fear and shame, then she thought.



I prepared myself for the marriage, but as expected it was impossible, this is too much. In reality, she wanted to dedicate her body and heart to the person she liked and wanted to become happy with them. That was her sincere feelings as a woman that leaked out from the concealed armor called a princess.



And, the stories of Kaori and Shizuku were recalled. Appearing at the time of a pinch, attacking and bringing down the unjust, it was said to be rescued from a swamp of danger, exactly like a fairytale story.



If she prayed for it, would she be saved. Ririana laughed at herself for thinking such foolish thoughts, still, her heart wished for it despite so.



In other words,



—–Save me



Then.



At that moment, Ririana who was pinned down by Bias saw something approaching from behind him, something like a small spider fell from the ceiling! and she witnessed it land. [Eh?] Ririana’s eyes opened wide in surprise at what was before her eyes, when the spider took 1 step with its foot, it sanked into Bias’s neck! the leg pieced though.



[Ow! What? Just now, my neck…..]



He felt pain running through his neck, Bias who was about to lock lips with Ririana’s stopped and felt his neck. At that time, the spider had already retreated back up it’s string and onto the ceiling.



Ririana watched the scene in amazement, Bias suddenly became sluggish and his eyes were starting to shut, immediately after that, he lost consciousness as is, and fell down onto Ririana.



[Eh? Eh?]



In front of the confused Ririana, again, the spider climbed down it’s string onto Bias. Bias is currently still covered on top of Ririana, the spider climbed down to his shoulder which was before Ririana’s eyes. While staring at it upclose, Ririana noticed a strangeness from the spider for the first time.



[……Metal…..spider?]



Right, the spider that was on Bias’s shoulder was made of metal. In front of the popeyed Ririana, the metal spider, [Stop~!], said to it, again, ~Pusu~! a different foot from a while ago was thrust into Bias’s neck. Despite already losing his consciousness he shook! Bias started trembling. He was still breathing, so it wasn’t meant to be a decisive blow.



Ririana didn’t think it’s purpose was to actually deliver the final blow though. And, the girl stared quietly at the spider before her eyes. If Ririana looked closer she noticed that the metal spider had a luster like crystal, it crawled up its string and smoothly returned to the ceiling.



[Ah, wait, please wait! By any chance, are you…..]



Although Ririana called out to it confusedly, the metal spider continued on ignoring her, while clinging to the ceiling with its 8 feet, ~Kisa Kisa~ it moved towards the outside wall. Then a slight red light was emitted, it walked out of the room while closing the hole it made through the wall and escaped.



While sitting down, Ririana used the torn dress to cover herself and at last the situation was understood, she muttered to herself while smiling.



[Thank you…..Nagumo-san]



Bias was Ririana’s fiance, just now in the place that she was helped, she understood when it patched up the hole. But, still, at this time, having answered her plea for help, she was helplessly glad. She gripped both her hands tightly as she held down the torn dress on her chest, Alternatively, it looked like she was grasping onto something else*I couldn’t tell if this was supposed to be a perverted reference or if this was in the meaning of her heart being taken away*.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Hajime and them who left the reception room was guided into another room by the maid attendants. After sending away the maid, Hajime who always had his eyes shut and was concentrating on something, abruptly opened them. Yue who noticed called out to Hajime in fewer words that usual.



[…..How was it? Hajime]



[……N~, excelent. ……there was something troublesome in the middle of it though……60% of the plan was completed]



The voice that answered Yue was slow and was concentrating on something else.



[that’s fast. As expected, are there many traps?]



[…..that’s right. but, there’s no reason to disarm them all]



[Fumu, it’s great that there’s a party today. If people gather, it’s easier to move around in various ways]



[It seems that people have finally begun to gather at the party hall huh. ……Will it go well?]



Shia said with a slightly uneasy expression.



After all, a once-in-a-lifetime great event that’ll decide her families futures is on the line. It would be weird if she wasn’t tensed. Towards such a Shia, Hajime felt her Usamimi’s, Yue caressed her cheeks, Teio was brushing her hair, and Kaori tightly clasped her hand.



To the smiling companions, Shia’s feelings began swelling up in her throat.



However, tears did not come down. For instance, even if it were tears of joy, it’ll be far to early to be crying when nothings even started yet. In its place, just like always, she smiled her bright smile. I’m not alone. My family is here too. I’m blessed to have them, her smile revealed such thoughts. It was the charm that Hajime and them liked about Shia.



Hajime who confirmed that Shia had smiled, is happy to have such a powerful companion and a smile that resembles a childs mischief grin appeared on his face.



[Now then, shall we prepare the stage for the main characters?]



To those words, Shia, Yue, Teio, and Kaori also had a similar smile and nodded powerfully.





Chapter 118




The sun has completely fallen, the corners of the Imperial castle become encased in darkness. 2 Empire soldiers were on patrol around the perimeter of the building leading to the dungeon. Some kind of torch-like fire magic was burning brightly in their hands, they’re paying a lot of attention towards the darkness in case of intruders.



[Ha~a, the upper brasses party should be around this time……I bet they’re eating delicious food….]



[Oi, don’t talk about meaningless things. If it’s found out, we’ll both be held responsible]



The soldiers sigh was mixed in with his grumbling as he looked towards the light of the other soldier further up ahead. Though both of them were frowning, their expression’s were due to different reasons. If anything, the atmosphere was like the feeling of “becoming even hotter because you’ve complained about the heat being hot.” In the back of their heads, they both released a complain.



[Though however, you’ve also woken up early, you’d also want to attend those kinds of things?]



[……Well yeah. though If we were allowed to go, there would be the problem of not having money nor a woman…..]



[Thats right~. After eating and getting drunk at the party, they’ll be playing with the ladies until morning? It’s like heaven. Ah~, rather than some meaningless patrolling, I want to embrace women~. The Usagininzoku women would be good~]



[You like Usagininzoku women right. Although all the other Demi-human women have nice bodies, the only thing you think about at the brothels are the Usagininzoku]



[That’s because those guys are the best out of the bunch when threatening them. They cry out in a good voice]



[That’s a rather distasteful hobby…..]



[What are you talking about. Don’t you think that the Usagininzoku’s just give out a, please tease me, aura? I’m only granting that wish. Even you like to crush countless people down]



[There’s no helping it though? They cry out in a good voice]



The 2 patrolling soldiers looked at one another in interest and began laughing out vulgarly.



In the Empire, the fact that Demi-humans were considered tools won’t change. In order to release their stress and sexual desires, there were many variety of tools that they could use. Therefore, these 2 are special, not through their sadistic characters though, it could be said that it was commonsense that every Empire soldier had the tendency of liking to shame their partner.



Then, at that time, one of the soldiers gave out a voice and expression as if they saw something unknown in the shadows of the buildings.



[N? …..Oi, just now, something…..]



[Ah? What is it?]



While thrusting out the torch before himself, the soldier was moving towards the buildings shadow. The other soldier also followed along while voicing out his doubt.



The first soldier proceeded to say, [Is anyone there?], but there was a gap in the buildings that was just barely big enough to fit one person! he turned the torch of fire towards it.



However, there wasn’t the figure of the shadow he had seen awhile ago, [Did I see wrong……], he muttered as he sighed in relief. Then, he turned around to look at his comrade while smiling wryly……



[My bad, I saw wr-………? Oi, Maul? Where are you? Maul?]



His comrade was not there, only the torch that he held was on the ground where he was once standing. Where did he go, the soldier looked around restlessly throughout the vicinity, however there wasn’t any shadow’s of a person. Then he felt a cold sensation running through his spine.



He began to feel fear welling up, the soldier went to pick up the torch that was suddenly fallen on the ground and called out to his comrade in high tension……



[Oi, Maul. Quit joking arou—-gu!?]



At that moment, two arms expanded without a sound from the gap in the buildings that no one was at earlier.



A black frosted knife that absorbed even light was being gripped in one of the hands which seemed to have grown out directly from the darkness, simultaneously, one hand covered up the soldiers mouth, and with the other, stabbed him through his medulla oblongata *its a part of your brain*.



In an instant, the soldier’s body that was convulsing started relaxing as strength left his body and disappeared into the darkness as it was dragged by the two arms.



And before anyone noticed, the torch that he was trying to pick up had disappeared and nothing was left, only a lukewarm evening wind blowing softly.



A small whisper can be heard from the wind in the darkness.



[HQ, this is Alpha. Suppression of Point C is complete]



[Alpha, this is HQ. Roger that. Move towards Point E. There are 4 sentinels. Sneak around from the East]



[HQ, this is Alpha. Roger that]



After whispering that, two or more people wrapped in black clothes from head to toe, starts moving one after the other.



Though they tightly concealed their faces with a black cloth, only their eyes were clear so that they could see, a sharp gaze was peeping out from there, in addition, they had two small swords bundled on their backs. If they were seen by a Japanese person they would probably say, [Ah~, a Ninja!].



But, even if you can’t identify the specific individual, unfortunately their true identities could easily be seen though. That’s because overhead of the covers you could see 2 grown Usamimi’s standing tall. No matter how you looked at it they were clearly Usagininzoku, the Hauria tribe.



They were concealing themselves under the darkness and shadows of buildings. they quietly peeped their face through there and saw the reported 4 sentinels which were broken into 2 pairs. A hand signal is sent towards the 3 people who were behind the Haura tribe member that called HQ a while ago.



The 3 people nodded in unison and slipped back, they disappeared into the dark as if they melted completely.



After waiting for a few seconds. From the place that was pointed to, ~Chika~ one of the sentinel’s glances deviated! and lights twinkled. Similarly, they didn’t actually enter the sentinel’s view, one of the Hauria opened a lid of a lighter-sized container for in an instant. This had a Green Light Stone inside which imitated a flashlight.



The Hauria which saw the signal began to move while issuing orders with hand signals towards the 2 behind him.



The moment the 2 sentinels were out of eachothers eyesights, they lowered their presence to the limit and quickly approached, one person covers the soldiers mouth and nose while the other stabbed him through his medulla oblongata, another also thrusts through the other soldier’s kidney while restraining him with one hand similarly and knocking him down to the ground.



The last person was taking the torches that the sentinels dropped and put out its fire and confirmed that there are no traces left. Then they dragged the bodies into the shadows of the buildings quickly.



However, as expected due to the long silence from the other pair, the 2 sentinels, [N?], turned their glance.



The appearance of their comrades which they glanced at earlier were no longer there. There’s not even light from the torch, only darkness. [Where did those guys go?], the sentinels looked hard with doubtful expressions, they managed to see a shadow that moved faintly in the darkness. It was the figure of something big being dragged.



[Anyway, this is bad!], the sentinel stretched out his hand to reach the alarm whistle which hung on his neck……



In the next instant, a knife was stabbed into the sentinel’s neck, there was no time to scream nor time to feel pain, his consciousness drifted into eternal darkness.



Next to the sentinel which held his whistle, similarly was his comrade who was also stabbed by a knife and dead. At the same time, the torches were put out and they dragged the bodies into the shadows of the building.



Presently, similar slaughters were being carried out everywhere at the Imperial castle.



A lot of stationed soldiers which were in pairs of two or more have already experienced an eternal separation from their bodies, soldiers who were sleeping in the barracks were drugged with sleeping pills made in the Sea of Trees which put them into a deep slumber. Even if the alarm was sounded, they’ll still be sleeping until morning and there fatigue would be fully relieved.



A crescent moon is now floating in the evening sky.



It’s other name was “The 2nd Moon”, where it was so thin that you can kinda see it but kinda not as well. *I don’t think I got this part correct at all lol, ??“???”???????????????????????????????*



It was exactly like the smile of demon.



The people who praised the principle that strength reigned supreme and cursed the weak, seemed to be completely laughed at under the moon.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



——HQ, this is Alpha. Suppression of Point H4 is complete.



——HQ, this is Bravo. Suppression of all of Point J is complete.



——HQ, this is Charlie. Scattering of sleeping medicine in the barracks is complete.



——HQ, this is Echo. The prince, eldest grandson of the Emperor and 2 princesses have been captured.



At the brightly glittering party hall, Hajime had a unusual smile on his face which was usually impossible and was talking with the aristocrat of the Empire, then he heard the reports of the Hauria which was entering his head one after another.



The hall was large, many places were gorgeous and decorated well. It was in the form of an all you can eat buffet, there were hundreds of dishes and sweets being displayed on the snow-white tablecloths spread on the tabletop, and waiters skilled in etiquette were distributing glass gallantly as they walked.



All of the people participating were VIP’s of the Empire. It was only people wearing glittering showy clothes with an atmosphere of mutual understanding of civil officers and military officers, military officers had conceited personalities because of the principles they believed in, the civil officers stood in relief and realized that the military officers were of a higher standing.



Hajime’s voice was heard positively speaking with those military officers.



After all, he was “God’s Apostle” and in the “Hero’s Group”. To general people he was a strong man who participated in the capturing of [Orcus Great Labyrinth], an indispensable force for the world, “Strength” was likely the standard existence which interested them all. Of course there were also secret desires to create good personal connections with him as well.



To begin with, presently, the people talking to Haime that had no ulterior motives and interests seemed to show more interests in the pretty women which stood by his side and never left it since the party started. it was obvious since their glances were always briefly turned towards Yue and them who waited behind Hajime as they talked with him.



But, it wasn’t completely unreasonable. The party was to welcome princess Ririana as well as her engagement party, Yue and their existences were rather than an uproar of decorated flowers being on display, it was more of the sense of being the leading role of the hall.



Shia wore a moonlight colored miniskirt dress which exposed her slender and beautiful legs.



However, it wasn’t vulgar, from the skirt extending softly, it created a unique atmosphere which empowered all of Shia’s loveliness. It also matched her beautiful straight hair which hung straight down, those factors were probably what gave her so much cuteness and elegance.



Next to her, Teio who was elegantly tilting her wine, wore a black long dress which was similar to her usual black kimono. However, because the dress was the type to show her bodylines, she had an intense bodyline without any irregularities, furthermore, because the back and her chest opened up greatly, it revealed her beautiful hills which could not be called anything but stunning as it was likely to spill out at anytime. The eyesights of the men at the hall would always glance towards it every now and then! They were attracted towards the lethal weapons, one after another their women partners gave them all glances of disgust.



Kaori was dressed in a slender line dress which completely exposed her shoulders. Although her bodyline wasn’t as intense as Teio’s, it’s ballance was definitely molded by God. Her beautiful legs momentarily peeped out through the skirt which had a deep slit like the Chinese dresses called the Qipao, along with the brightness of her silver hair, it caused her sex appeal to show and eyes unintentionally turned towards her.



And, Hajime’s favorite, his beloved blood sucking princess——wore a pure-white wedding dress(modoki *i dono what this is supposed to mean but its in parentheses, ???*).



The cloth was lustrous, her shoulders were exposed, and her skirt’s hem was ruffled with frills which expanded out greatly. Her hair was in a ponytail with an elegant white flower ornament to hold it in place. Her exposure was—–few in number, it was her glossy white neck, her lips of red rouge which attracted much attention, and her eyes which were slightly moistened had conceived heat which provoked men’s desires helplessly. As usual, Yue’s charms came from the gap of her childish appearance and her bewitching atmosphere which was enhanced several times over.



Inside of the room, Hajime and the other men were waiting for Yue and them to finish changing but, the moment when they entered, it was unavoidable that they were taken in by the overflowing charm and became completely stiff.



Especially, Hajime whose eyes were completely nailed down to Yue, anyone who saw it would notice that his heart was completely taken away. Yue as well probably understood it. She stared straight back at Hajime with a joyful smile.



Although the other females became angry at Hajime for not glancing at them and was about to start complaining to him, Hajime moved faster and forcefully embraced Yue closely and gave her a deep kiss, now the males without female relationships stiffened up for a different reason, afterwards, they began to tear apart Hajime and Yue who were remaining together forever by force which was also later known as the “Hajime’s reasoning was blown away incident”……



Anyways, [Do you understand who’s engagement party this is? Ne~e? Do you know?], they began tsukkomi’ing Yue and them who took away the show.



By the way, Shizuku and Suzu was also dressed up, although they were gorgeous enough to not lose to the daughters of the Empire nobles……as expected, they weren’t at the level of taking away Hajime’s heart like Yue and them, rather they had no strong motive to do so in the first place, to begin with they gave out less of an impression when compared with Yue and them’s mature impressions.



[Even still, Nagumo-dono’s companions are all beautiful ones]



[That’s damn right. I’d like to take one of them to keep me company for the dance after this]



——HQ, this is Delta. Blast preparation points are all prepared.



——HQ, this is India. Suppression of Point M is complete.



To the half-serious words of the Empire nobles, Hajime exchanges a smile with them as he hears the report from telepathy which reached his ears, the entrance to the hall became increasingly noisy. It appears that it was time for the appearance of princess Ririana and his Highness Bias to take the leading role. A civil officer-like man conveyed the appearance of the two people in a loud voice.



Zawa~……



Ririana’s figure in a dress emerged from the door which was exaggeratedly opened, people in the hall raised out voices mixed with surprise and perplexity.



It was because Ririana wore a jet black dress which seemed to breath in all the lights. Normally, if you consider Ririana’s figure and the outline of the engagement party, a brighter dress would be much more suitable. Towards that fact, [I’m here out of obligation], kind of feeling along with a cleansed face, the jet black dress looked like a wall that Ririana had put on.



Her partner, his Highness Bias as well, with a slightly sour expression as if having crushed a bug, no matter how you looked at it, this was not the scene of a happily married couple, for the time being the hall started being filled with applause, it was a very delicate atmosphere.



As is, those 2 went up to the platform.



the Chairman person allowed the party to progress even though it was puzzling. Looking at Ririana and Bias’s states, even now Gaharudo was about to explode out laughing while greeting them, music began to flow into the hall. It was time for the greetings circle to dance with Ririana and the others. Elegant music resounded in the hall which wiped out the delicate atmosphere.



At the center of the hall, Men who took out their flowers began to dance freely. Although it was completely mechanical, Bias and Ririana also danced. Mainly, Ririana’s expression was due to the atmosphere.



Even if Bias draws closer forcefully, a slight distance was noticed in regards to the melody. As it was, one piece of music finally finished, Ririana quickly advanced onto the next person in the greetings circle.



Bias had an irritated expression, however, he needed to continue on with the greetings circle. In a state that seemed to subtly care about his groin. Actually, after just having woken up a few minutes ago, he did not have time to confronted Ririana what had happened before the start of the party and no one else knew. For some unknown reason his son was blocked out from reviving (the appearance of the person that revives), feeling impatient and irritated of the situation he could do nothing but follow Ririana, as no one else knew.



——HQ, this is Romeo. Suppression of Point P is complete.



——HQ, this is Tango. Suppression of Point R is complete.



[How do I say this, that not like Riri at all. Usually she’d hide her real intentions…..]



Kaori muttered as she saw Ririana exchanging greetings indifferently without a smile.



[…….Ma~a, Those kinds of things are impossible huh. The princess must also have a lot of things to think about]



[…..Many things?]



Yue and them became puzzled at Hajime’s words.



[Nagumo-kun, did something happen to Riri?]



[Oi, Yaegashi. What do you mean by that, come on]



Shizuku was in a wine-red long dress and looked at Hajime suspiciously.



[Because, Riri’s showing that kind of attitude in a public place…..if something insane happened then, it’s roughly Nagumo-kun’s fault right? That’s been the rule for all the times up till now. In fact, you seem like you know something]



[Chi, that’s hard to refute…..but, this time I’ve really done nothing. Just that, as I was passing by I helped out the Princess who was about to be raped by the crowned prince]



[Right, Riri was being ra-…….what was that?]



[Wait a second, Hajime-kun!? Just now what did you!?]



Led by Shizuku and Kaori, everyone turns a surprised look towards Hajime.



Since the dance started a lot of troublesome men have come to ask Yue and them for a dance, although Yue and them had no intentions of dancing with any other man other than Hajime, presently, they’ve all been driven away by Hajime’s “Pressure”, so only Yue and them as well as Shizuku was around.



Kouki was forcibly taken out by the ladies and was dancing desperately as he wasn’t accustomed to it, while Ryutaro was single-mindedly eating. Suzu was dancing with a dandy*lol didn’t notice I spelt that wrong, thanks Schion93* old man in a, [Ho~ee] kind of feeling.



Therefore, the only people who heard about Ririana almost being raped by Bias was Yue and them. Unexpectedly, Kaori and Shizuku demanded with lots of momentum for an explanation from Hajime, attention started to gather around.



[Ah~, yes, that’s why……Yue, do you want to dance once?]



[N~…..I’d be pleased]



[Ah, wait a second, Nagumo-kun! Don’t run away just because it’s become troublesome! Explain it properly to us!]



[Th, that’s right! It’s an important matter! Properly explain it!]



According to Shizuku’s words, Hajime who thought that an explanation would be too troublesome, took Yue’s hand and planned to escape onto the dance hall. In another sense, the attention was focused on the girl with a pretty face which resembled a work of art much more remarkable than Ririana who was the leading role and on the boy who was her partner (Tuxedo Ver.) with white hair and an eye patch.



Normally, in order to match Yue who was accustomed to royal dances and was leading, Hajime decided to use “Light Speed” while dancing. Since the dance was being observed, he wanted to look good. Joyfully, Yue’s expression was that of someone who was filled with happiness, and Hajime’s eyes were softening towards that, combined with their clothes and looking from the sides, it was completely an engagement party for those two.



Although the musicians somewhere desperately tried to heat up the place as it became awkward, they used Hajime and Yue’s atmosphere to begin playing joyfully. By now, the leading role in the hall is Hajime and Yue, everyone paid attention to the two that were dancing round and round happily.



Towards such people, Ririana watched them with a smile. In there laid some color of envy as well.



On one hand, there was a group of women yearning for Hajime, and more may appear in the future, Ririana temporarily pushed the events that just happened into the corner of her head, [Who’s next!?], it became a battle for the second person.



The performance would be ending soon, Grand applause was presented towards the two people who were kissing with each other lightly as the aristocrats of the Empire were watching with smiles. In their eyes, pure feelings of admiration and praise were seen. The daughters of the noblemen as well, [Ho~u], absentmindedly leaked out hot sighs.



Hajime and Yue gracefully bowed in return towards the applause and returned to their friends while holding hands. Apparently Teio won the competition and gets the next dance, she looked towards Hajime with eyes of expectation.



However, Teio’s expectation was easily betrayed.



[Nagumo Hajime-sama, would you please accompany me for one dance?]



Right, it was because another person had already called out to him.



The other person was Ririana.



[Princess….for the leading role to be separating from their partner, what happened suddenly?]



[Ara, that leading role was just deprived of her seat, so aren’t those words rather cruel?]



[Isn’t it because you’ve got that work face on? Actually, is it alright to leave the crowned prince alone?]



[If it’s about the greetings circle it’s practically finished already, now is the time to enjoy the party. In the first place we’re supposed to dance with several people. Look, the crowned prince is also dancing with one of his mistresses]



[A mistress…..you don’t look concerned at all huh]



[Fufu. Rather than that, I’d like you to take my hand soon….can you not dance?]



Hajime noticed that Ririana didn’t only want to dance but also say something, he could roughly guess what it was she wanted to talk about, with a, what should I do, he scratched his cheek. To be honest, he wanted to keep bathing in the afterglow of dancing with Yue……



Then, towards the hesitating Hajime, Yue who was next to him said, [Meh!]. It seemed she said that to convey to not disgrace Ririana at a public place. Yue understood that Hajime couldn’t decide on what to do so the, [Meh!], that was said to decide things for him.



[Ah~, I get it. …..I would be happy to be your partner, Princess]



[…..Yes]



Had they attracted attention, there was an unusual action of Hajime respectfully taking Ririana’s hand and led her towards the center of the dance hall. Previously, the dance with Yue was still probably within their minds. Ririana has a slightly ashamed attitude and the degree of attention towards that is high.



By the way, during the interactions with Ririana, nobody cared about Teio who hardened up as her hand was held out for a long time. [Th, this timing, so it’s come! Whatever you do, I understand master! Haa~ Haa~…..N~], with reddened and blushed cheeks, nobody bothered to tsukkomi.



The melody of music began to flow out calmly. Ririana and Hajime were sticking close to one another as their bodies shook waveringly gracefully. Ririana whispered quietly while her face drawn close to his shoulder.



[……Thank you very much for a little while ago]



[As I thought, it was that…….so you know]



[Such an insane situation, it couldn’t be anyone but you right? Besides, your “Deep Red” is very beautiful……I wouldn’t mistake that]



[Is that so? Ma~a, the first prince of the Empire is also stuck with that, it’s only a temporary measure though*Thanks The_Codfish, I thought it sounded odd lol*. Sooner or later]



[You’re just saying it blatantly huh. …..But, even if it was just an example I was glad. I heard from Kaori about when you saved them, I longed for that a little bit]



She said as she separated from Hajime’s shoulder with a little smile on her face. That smile was Ririana’s original charm which couldn’t be compared to with the one seen with Bias a while ago, the surrounding aristocrats which were paying attention became slightly noisy when they noticed.



[And, are various things settled about your attitude in that dress?]



[Does it not match me?]



[It suits you. But, as expected that pink dress would have suited you more. Did you plan on insinuating*hint that something bad had happened* them to reveal the truth?]



[Yes, because this degree is enough for a husband who assaults his wife……more so…..as expected you saw everything through that spider huh. …..My improper appearance….a~a, I’m not fit to be a bride anymore]



Yoyoyo~! then, towards Ririana who buried her face onto Hajime’s shoulder again while pretending to break down, [What are you talking about….], Hajime looked at her with a ridiculous expression.



[Despite saying it in a low voice, don’t say such seldom remarks in such a place. Or rather, haven’t you been making too much contact since a while ago? The crowned prince has quite the incredible expression?]



[It’s fine isn’t it. Once this night ends I’ll be the crown princess. Just for now, allow me to be just a girl. Also, I’ll be assaulted one day, can’t you succumb to the selfishness of a pitiful bullied princess for a little while?]



[Being assaulted, it’s not set that you’ll be bullied……]



[It’s already a fact]



There Ririana, while hiding her expression by clinging onto Hajime tightly, suddenly muttered something as if on accident.



[……If…….if, I said “Help” what would you do?]



Ririana herself didn’t plan on hearing about these things. It was necessary to put a conclusion to the matrimonial relationship between the prince of the Empire for the future. Both countries took damage from the surprise attacks from the demons that the Majinzoku brought, it was necessary to show strength of unity as humans to stabilize things now that the head church temple had disappeared. As someone from the royal family, she should take on that role. For example, even if a painful marriage life filled with the lost of her dignity awaits her.



But still asking Hajime of such things, her voice trembled with fear from the bottom of her heart in the case of the help that she was expecting for doesn’t come, having seen Yue look so happy while being embraced by Hajime, she thought that surely Hajime would say, “I refuse”. And she steeled herself for that possibility. It was because she thought that it would be fine for her to be selfish for this one time.



But, Hajime’s answer was completely off from what she expected.



[Ma~a, before I accompany you, you’ll be saved regardless? In this case, the Empire(. . .) may be ending tonight……at the very least, the crowned prince would be hopeless]



[…..Yes?*more of a, what?, sense*]



——HQ, this is Victor. Suppression of Point S is complete.



——HQ, this is X-Ray*thanks Dim1 that does sound right lol, ?????*. Suppression of Point Y is complete.



Towards Ririana who instinctively looks up, Hajime’s mouth lifts up into a grin.



His expression was seen and a bad feeling surged into Ririana’s mind. There wasn’t a touching atmosphere like a while ago, Ririana felt her cheeks cramping up. Hajime quietly drew his mouth close to Ririana’s ear.



[And also, I’ll make it so that you can understand easier. I’m insensitive, so I might end up doing something carelessly]



[~……..]



Ririana’s body shook with a shock. Though there was the breath and voice coming down onto her ear, it’s because she understood what Hajime was implying.



In other words, “I’ll Help you”. Ririana’s heart was shaken intensely. The princess within Ririana began to shout. This marriage is an obligation that should be fulfilled. That’s why, I wanted you to cast away that girl who held onto those dreams in one strike.Then.



[Why?], in another sense acting upon cruel treatment, or perhaps it was due to her joy that her eyes moistened up towards Hajime, Hajime acted as if it was nothing, in another sense, he replied without reading the atmosphere and gave the worst response possible.



[The Princess is unfortunate, to be feeling bad for those guys]



Hajime said so and glanced over towards Kaori and them. In brief, their purpose was not exactly for Ririana’s sake, although Hajime said, Ririana was unfortunate, he seemed to also imply don’t hurt my “Important” people*This line was quite shaky for me, it was either this or he was being a tsundere, or he was implying that she wasn’t important?*. Ririana guessed so and stared at Hajime.



[Isn’t that, too much of a lie even if it’s coming from you? We’ll, surely fall?]



[What are you going do if it happens? Ma~a, for the time being, it’s just necessary to think that the worst outcome that you’ve thought of won’t be happening. As long as you’re important friends of these fellows, that is]



[……Nagumo-san’s resolution doesn’t shake huh……..truly, I’m envious of Yue-san]



Ririana watches Hajime with a hateful expression. Hajime was indifferent towards it and glanced right back. Then finally the end of the music was coming up. Hajime looked unfazed, Ririana who eventually gave up, [Fuu~], breathed outwards and leaned her body onto Hajime, she decided to at least momentarily enjoy the dance for now.



And while leaving a lingering sound, the music stopped, Ririana reluctantly parted her body away, and for a while kept their hands held together while quietly staring at Hajime……[Thank you] she muttered. With a lovely smile just like a flower that was fully bloomed.



It was simply the smile of a 14-year-old girl. A smile that was so pure that it didn’t have any impurities, it pierced through all the hearts of the people who saw it. A sigh filled with heat could be heard somewhere. And, after a while, a grand applause which didn’t lose against Yue’s dance from a while ago resounded. It appears that Ririana only danced with the other people simply because it was required, Hajime separated from her and returned alone, and the eyes of ladies greeted him.



[Hajime-kun’s a woman killer…..]



[…….Hajime-san, when on earth did you……I can’t let down my guard at all]



[No~o, Master. I got a little wet from the neglecting play, is it alright for me to change my underwear?]



[This has to do with those assault remarks from a while ago right. …..You said something about helping out Riri during a dangerous time, did you plan on dealing the finishing blows during the dance? Ne~e, what exactly did you whisper to her? To begin with, isn’t Riri a married woman now? Do you understand? Ne~e, do you understand? Nagumo-kun?]



[Hawawa, Nagumo-kun, finally you’ve obtained the NETORI*taking another person’s lover* attribute…….you’re too much of an adult. You’ve well exceeded Suzu’s capacity]



A number of perverted remarks were mixed in, equally, towards the female group that was bad mouthing him and Ririana, [What are you talking about], he said with an amazed expression.



Hajime began talking, he helped out while he was passing by, then danced only because it was requested of him. Afterwards, because Kaori and them would be concerned, he only informed them the minimum amount about how he helped.



There was no intentions of persuading them in any way. And if by chance, to the hundredth millionth decimal, that Ririana fell in love with Hajime, Hajime himself gave off a [Like I care?] feeling.



For now, just to be sure, he turned his gaze towards Yue to not misunderstand it, Yue understood and gripped onto Hajime’s hand in assent while nodding her head, as expected Yue was different from them, his love for Yue knew no bounds and rose way beyond the universe. It must have been his imagination that her grip was stronger than usual.



——HQ, this is Zulu. Suppression of Point Z is complete



——Notify the entire force, this is HQ, all arrangements have been completed. Start the countdown.



Shia’s expression stiffened up a little as she heard the communication. Kaori had a slightly tensed expression as well. Shizuku and them who were not given the Telepathy stone (Improved Ver.), only looked at the 2 with suspicious expressions. Moreover, Gaharudo often went up onto the platform on a daily bases and kept glancing towards Hajime and them. This time it appears that he was going to give out a speech and a toast in celebration.



[Now then, first of all, let me express our gratitude for having joined us on this party which serves as a celebration for Princess Ririana visiting our country as well as being engaged with my son. There were many various surprises and it indeed became an interesting event]



Then Gaharudo turned a meaningful glance towards Hajime. Hajime was pretending to not know. Gaharudo’s expression seems to convey that it’s become even more interesting.



At the same time, a resolute voice was heard from Hajime’s telepathy stone.



——To all troops. This is Alpha One. From this point on we will put an end to this persecution we’ve suffered through for hundreds of years, we will carve our names into the history of this world. Our name will be used as the pronunciation of fear. This place is the intersection of fate. Will we fall into hell or advance towards the future, everything depends on this one battle. There’s no need to hold back. Sa~a, we’ll show them just how weak our claws and fangs are



——10, 9, 8…….



——Boss. For leading us into this battle, we deeply appreciate it.



Hajime and them heard the Usagininzoku’s countdown which concerned their fates.



The aristocrats of the Empire doesn’t suspect a thing.



the speeches of the 2 different races overlapped with one another.



[The party has only just begun. Tonight, eat a lot, drink a lot, and dance as much as your heart pleases. It will become the best blessings for my son and daughter-in-law. Sa~a, raise your cups!]



As Gaharudo confirmed that everyone in the hall held up their cups, he poured himself wine to the very brim of his cup. And, with his breath taking initiative with a ~Suu~ breathing in with ambition.



The other side of the telepathy also, once again similarly.



——Get fired up! Let’s go!!!



——[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [Ou~!!!] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



——4, 3, 2, 1…….



And, the countdown has finally—-



[The unity of humanity will become stronger with this marriage! There is nothing to fear! We are the glorious Human race!]



[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [For Glory!!] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]



——0. I wish you great fortune in war.



At that moment.



All lights vanished and the hall was swallowed by darkness.





Chapter 119




[What!? What happened!?]



[Iya~a!? What’s with this!?]



The aristocrats of the Empire who were suddenly deprived of one of their senses shouted out angrily in a shaky voice which contained confusion and unrest.



[Don’t panic! Use magic to create ligh-ga~a!?]



[What’s wron-gya~!?]



[What happen-gu~!?]



A relatively calm person tried to create a sphere of light while giving out instructions to others to secure their vision. However, the sound of a scream and something falling down happened right afterwards. At the same time, the confused aristocrats all begin screaming one after another.



The place soon sanked into confusion once again. Especially, the mademoiselles who completely fell into panic and began running around blindly, the sounds of collisions and people falling resounded out rapidly from various places.



[Calm down! Can you bastards still call yourselves soldier’s of the Empire!]



Gaharudo’s voice filled with ambition resounded throughout the hall in the darkness. With the loud scolding voice, the aristocrats who started falling into panic and screaming due to the darkness stopped.



However……



Hyu! Hyu! Hyu!



[~!? Chi! Sneaking around so annoyingly!]



Countless arrows came flying towards Gaharudo from the darkness.



With short notice, a surprise attack of arrows which held amazing speed and power attacked Gaharudo from all directions. Moreover, it was pulled off with exquisite timing, being bombarded with arrows which were incredibly accurate was definitely a bad position to be in, with so much flying towards him Gaharudo had no choice but be pushed into a one-sided defensive battle. He couldn’t afford to give out instructions to recover the situation anymore.



Still in the pitch black darkness, while fending the blows with the ceremonial sword, he could only grasp where the arrows were coming from due to the noise of them cutting through the air. The noise surrounding Gaharudo began raising out roars. Gin! Gin! Gin! The sound of metal colliding resounded out.



The sounds of peoples screams resounded one after the other while collapsing, due to Gaharudo’s scolding, people who regained their calm created fireballs to act as a light.



They called out to the guards loudly while looking around their surroundings with a fierce expression.



Something like a black shadow zinged by in the edge of their sights! It traveled quickly as if slicing through the wind.



[~!? Who are y-ggebu!?]



Immediately the aristocrat man tried to shoot a fireball towards the shadow.



However, the shadow that dashed out from the darkness dressed in black (+Usamimis) immediately pulled out a small black sword which completely blended in with the darkness, as if it was a joke, a head was mown down instantly.



~Pon~ the head flew through the air and rolled around on the ground with the vivid sounds. The head had a blank face, it seems he didn’t notice that he was no longer connected with his body.



Before anyone noticed, all fireballs which were illuminating the surroundings had disappeared and the only color left was the darkness.



The aristocrats and mademoiselles gathered towards the people who created fireballs like moths being provoked by the light, they managed to catch a glimpse of the shadow’s Usamimis immediately before the fireball was extinguished, then the spectacle of the persons head flying through the air was witnessed immediately afterwards. Then once again, their waists gave out against the assailant who disappeared under the cover of the darkness.



[Hi~, m, monster~!]



[I, I don’t want to die~, someone, anyone!]



Most of the people unable to stand up were the mademoiselle and civil officers, quite a few of the military officers as well too. Their minds couldn’t endure the darkness which was equivalent to the death god’s sickle and the assailant’s existence which appeared right in front of their eyes.



As such, without exception, without being able to do anything, and while doing nothing, the tendons in their hands and feet were cut by the person dressed in black soundlessly, they fell laying on the ground writhing in pain.



Although there were those pathetically miserable people, as a military nation which adheres to the principles that abilities reigned supreme, some couldn’t permit themselves to continue wailing away in confusion forever. Veterans who survived countless battles, although they didn’t have a sword like Gaharudo, relied on their daggers which they kept in their breast pocket for self defense, they united with their companions and began creating a battle formation.



while back to back with one another, the magicians were placed in the center. It was splendid cooperation.



The people who were relatively nearby to Gaharudo immediately created a battle formation to defend his back. The range that Gaharudo had to consider was immediately decreased by half, now the attacks were no longer a problem. Gaharudo began chanting while knocking down dozens of arrows to the side.



A bit less than 10 fireballs were produced in an instant and shot out at surprising speeds. They spread out throughout the hall and began to brighten up the darkness.



Begin the counter attack! Though it was Gaharudo yelling out threateningly, immediately afterwards, a lump of metal rolled around in front of him.



[What? Is this……]



The man who serves as Gaharudo’s aid moved in closer to check out the objects purpose with suspicion. It wasn’t only him though, others who secured their lightsource at different areas were the same.



Gaharudo had an severely unpleasant premonition, he immediately yelled out in a controlling voice



[Stop! Don’t get clos-!?]



[~!?]



Although the aid who heard Gaharudo’s words reflectively tried to leap back but, that action was meaningless judging by the effects of the lump of metal. That was proven in the next instant.



Ka!



Kyiiiiiin!!



All of the sudden, just when you thought the lump of metal popped, intense light surged out and an immense sound indiscriminately violated the surroundings.



[Gua~a!?]



[Guu~u!]



[What is!?]
